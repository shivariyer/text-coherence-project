BC-Japan-Earthquake|Strong Earthquake Jolts Northern Japan, Kurils. 

TOKYO (AP) A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 shook northern Japan and the southern Kuril Islands early Thursday, meteorological officials said. 

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the undersea tremor, which occurred at 6:37 am (21:37 GMT Wednesday). 

Japan's Central Meteorological Agency also said there was no danger of tsunami, or seismic waves caused by earthquakes, hitting Japan. 

The earthquake was centered just below the seafloor about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of the island of Iturup, Etorofu in Japanese, the agency said. 

Iturup is among several southern Kuril islands that are clamd by Japan but have been occupied by Russia since the end of World War II. 

On Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, the tremor was most strongly felt in Kushiro, which is about 900 kilometers (560 miles) northeast of Tokyo. 

The Kurils have been the scene of repeated undersea earthquakes since late last year. 

On Dec. 11, an earthquake with amgnitude of 7 shook the region, but caused no significant damage. 

An earthquake registering magnitude 6 or larger is capable of causing serious damage in populated areas.
