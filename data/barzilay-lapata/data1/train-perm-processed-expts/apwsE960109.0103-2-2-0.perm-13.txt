The latest quake, on Monday, did not kill anyone, officials said. 

About 2,000 of Neftegorsk's 3,000 residents were killed, and the rest were relocated to other towns. 

After Monday's quake, Sakhalin was hit by a blizzard and heavy winds, that was expected to last at least three more days. 

It razed 14 apartment buildings in Okha, leaving 800 families homeless, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. 

A spokesman in Moscow for the Ministry of Emergency Situations said there were no immediate reports of injuries. 

The deadly May quake was centered 145 kilometers (90 miles) south of Okha and 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Neftegorsk.
