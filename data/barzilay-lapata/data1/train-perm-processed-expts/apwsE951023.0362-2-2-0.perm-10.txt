BEIJING (AP) A strong earthquake with numerous aftershocks killed at least 14 people in mountainous southwestern Yunnan province Tuesday morning, a local seismology official said. 

The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.5 struck at about 6:46 am (2246 GMT), China's Central Seismology Bureau said. 

At least 14 people were killed, said Luo Shaode, an official in the seismology bureau in Wuding county, the quake's epicenter. 

Most telephone lines had been cut, making it difficult to know how many casualties there were, he said.
