An official at the Central Seismology Bureau, who identified himself only as Tang, said he did not expect damage or injuries to be very serious because the area, along China's border with Mongolia, Russia and Kazakhstan, is sparsely inhabited. 

More than 100 aftershocks, all with amgnitude of less than 3, had been recorded since the quake struck at 2:43 a.m. 

(1843 GMT Tuesday), Shu said. 

The magnitude 6.1 earthquake was powerful enough to crack the walls of some houses in the city closest to the quake's epicenter, Altai, but there were no reports of injuries or more serious damage, said Shu Naiqing of the Xinjiang Earthquake Bureau.
