The earthquake was centered about 110 kilometers (65 miles) beneath the bottom of the Flores sea in the Indonesian archipelago, the meteorological agency said. 
A magnitude 5 earthquake is capable of causing considerable damage. 
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.6 struck eastern Indonesia early Sunday, causing panic but no reported casualties or damage. 
Residents in the town of Mamre burst out of their homes after the quake hit shortly past midnight, but there were no reports of damage or injuries, Yoseph Flavianus, a meteorological agency spokesman, said by telephone from Maumere, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) southeast of Jakarta. 
He said people were easily frightened because they remembered a 7.5 magnitude quake in December 1992 which killed at least 2,500 people and destroyed thousands of buildings in the area.
