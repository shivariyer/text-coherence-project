An undersea volcano erupted six years ago in the same area, just off Ito City, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Tokyo. 
Monitoring of the area has been intensified, but officials of Japan's Central Meteorological Agency say they do not believe volcanic activity is likely in the near future.

Some 100 undersea volcanoes are located in the sea off Ito. 
TOKYO (AP) The number of earthquakes over the past week off the shores of a seaside resort just southwest of Tokyo reached 6,518 early Wednesday, with 100 of them strong enough to be felt by humans. 
The agency said the recent surge in activity began Sept. 29. 
Seismologists believe the activity, which has caused only minor damage and no injuries, is the result of the movement of molten rock deep beneath the earth's crust.
