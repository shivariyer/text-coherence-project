BEIJING (AP) A strong earthquake with many aftershocks jolted southwestern Yunnan province Tuesday morning, China's Central Seismology Bureau said. 
There were no reports of casualties so far, a bureau seismologist said 2 1/2 hours after the magnitude 6.5 quake struck around 6:46 am (2246 GMT Monday). 
The temblor was centered 60 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of the provincial capital of Kunming, or about 2,200 kilometers (1,300 miles) southwest of Beijing, said the seismologist, who only identified himself by his surname, Ma. 
``The earthquake was relatively strong and there were many aftershocks,'' said Ma. 
A spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey, Don Kelly, said previous earthquakes in the area have caused casualties.
