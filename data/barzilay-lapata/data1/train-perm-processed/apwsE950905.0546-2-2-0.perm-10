The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1, was centered off the eastern shores of Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands, at a depth of 60 kilometers (37 miles). 
Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries, and quakes occur frequently in the area where Wednesday's originated. 
Weather bureau officials said the quake was too weak to be felt on Hokkaido because of the epicenter's depth and distance from shore.
