Monitoring of the area has been intensified, but officials of Japan's Central Meteorological Agency say they do not believe volcanic activity is likely in the near future. 
Some 100 undersea volcanoes are located in the sea off Ito. 
The agency said the recent surge in activity began Sept. 29. 
An undersea volcano erupted six years ago in the same area, just off Ito City, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Tokyo. 
Though seismologists believe the activity is beginning to slow, a strong quake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.4 shook the region Wednesday evening, bringing the total number of quakes to 6,694 and those strong enough to be felt to 103. 
TOKYO (AP) The number of earthquakes over the past week off the shores of a seaside resort just southwest of Tokyo topped 6,600 Wednesday, with more than 100 strong enough to be felt.

Seismologists believe the quakes, which have caused only minor damage and no injuries, are the result of the movement of molten rock deep beneath the earth's crust.
