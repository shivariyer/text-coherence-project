Ami Shapira of the Israel Seismological Institute said the quake's epicenter was 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of Haifa and was felt in some of the city's suburbs at 15:32 (13:32 GMT). 
He said it measured 3 on the Richter scale, which is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. 
``It was quite small and it is quite surprising that people felt it,'' Shapira said.
