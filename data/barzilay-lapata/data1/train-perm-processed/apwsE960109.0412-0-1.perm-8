BEIJING (AP) An earthquake that shook the far west Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region caused no damage or casualties, China's Central Seismology Bureau said Wednesday. 
The temblor with a 5.2 preliminary magnitude hit Wusu county at 2:27 p.m. (0627 GMT) Tuesday, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said in a two-sentence report. 
A bureau seismologist said no one was killed or injured and no buildings toppled in the towns in Wusu. 
The county is about 2,700 kilometers (1,600 miles) west of Beijing. 
``Nothing happened.''
