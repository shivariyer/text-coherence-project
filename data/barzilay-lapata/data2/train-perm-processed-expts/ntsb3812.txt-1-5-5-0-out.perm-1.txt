On March 7, 2000, at 1020 hours Pacific standard time a Bell 47G-4A, N1354X, made an uncommanded hard landing after takeoff from Wasco, California. 

The aircraft sustained substantial damage; however, the commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was not inured. 

The aircraft was being operated as an agricultural application flight by Inland Crop Dusters, Inc., under 14 CFR Part 137 when the accident occurred. 

The flight was originating from a service truck at the time of the accident. 

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed. 

The pilot reported to Federal Aviation Administration inspectors that he had filled his hopper and was departing for a spray run when the main rotor rpm unexpectedly drooped. 

The rotor rpm was in the process of increasing but, before the pilot was able to arrest the sink rate, the aircraft landed hard on the right skid. 

A review of accident records for the aircraft revealed a similar occurrence in 1993. 

In this event, the main rotor clutch slipped during takeoff resulting in a momentary droop in main rotor rpm and an uncommanded hard landing.
