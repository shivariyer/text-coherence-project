Examination of the left and right engine did not reveal any condition that would have caused an operational problem. 

A review of pilot log sheets showed that the pilot had prevously flown the Piper PA-34 between 1/13/86 and 10/6/91; since that period, he had only flown it once, which was on the day before the accident. 

Two work orders had been signed off on the day of the accident; one indicated that the airplane was in an airworthy; the other (with a later invoice number) indicated that the airplane was not in an airworthy condition. 

The pilot was attempting to return to the departure airport when the airplane collided with trees and a chimney, then it crashed in a residential area. 

Neither propeller was in the feather position. 

Reportedly, during that flight, he had flown the airplane for one hour, but did not practice emergency procedures. 

When queried after takeoff, the pilot informed ATC that the left engine was not developing full power, and that he was having difficulty in maintaining altitude.
