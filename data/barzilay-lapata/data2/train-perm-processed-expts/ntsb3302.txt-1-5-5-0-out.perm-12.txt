The airplane was being used for sport parachute operations. 

Subsequent examination of the engine revealed that one crankshaft counterweight had broken its retaining lugs and was liberated inside the engine, resulting in sudden stoppage of the engine. 

Counterweight detuning results from excessively rapid throttle movements. 

The airplane continued to be flown with no further maintenance action taken. 

Metallurgical examination of the crankshaft and counterweight revealed damage that was consistent with 'detuning' of the engine counterweights. 

The fire was extinguished prior to the destruction of the airplane. 

During the initial climb after takeoff the right engine failed followed by the airplane's slow descending right turn into wooded terrain. 

The airplane crashed through trees and caught on fire. 

The sudden stoppage prevented the pilot from feathering the propeller. 

Additionally, the engine log indicated that during an oil change 8 days before the accident, wear metal was found in the oil.
