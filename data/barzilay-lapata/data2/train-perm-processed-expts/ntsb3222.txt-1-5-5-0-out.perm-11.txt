The pilot had flown the airplane once around the traffic pattern earlier in the morning with no discrepancies noted following removal and reinstallation of 4 of the 6 cylinders several days earlier. 

Fretting was noted on both crankcase halves at the No. 2 main bearing saddle and the associated bearing was broken, extruded, and the bearing saddle was also extruded. 

Following recovery of the airplane examination of the engine revealed the crankshaft was failed aft of the No. 2 main bearing due to fatigue then overload. 

The flight then departed on the chartered cargo flight and shortly after takeoff, the engine experienced a partial then complete loss of power. 

Also, the No. 3 main bearing halves were found to be shifted. 

He then flew the airplane on a short positioning flight also with no discrepancies noted. 

With unsuitable terrain ahead the pilot ditched the airplane. 

The engine had been operated for 423 hours since at the time of the accident. 

Review of the maintenance records revealed that overhauled cylinders were installed at all positions in August of 1996.
