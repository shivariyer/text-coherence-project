I feel that it required extremely hard ground contact to cause the amount of damage that the aircraft sustained. 
The airplane came to rest on the right side of the runway, about 250 feet from the point of initial impact. 
Inspection of the runway surface showed that an initial heavy nose wheel strike occurred in the center of runways 15 and 21, followed by one prop strike indentation in the runway about 15 feet later, and then skid marks indicating that the nose wheel had collapsed and was sliding sideways.' 
The FAA inspector stated; '... 
nose wheel was driven into the lower cowling with enough force to lock the control yoke in the full up position...[and] there appeared to be considerable wrinkling of the external skin on the fuselage and the wings.' 
The flight had landed on runway 15.
