With a fight instructor, the pilot executed a normal takeoff from Runway 34 for right closed traffic. 
Pilots of small aircraft should use caution when operating behind landing helicopters. 
After a short delay, the UH-60 air-taxied to the ramp. 
Witness statements place the UH-60, 100 to 600 feet away from the accident airplane at the time of the accident. 
Because a UH-60 helicopter was executing an approach from the southwest to the threshold of Runway 34, the pilot extend the touchdown point by 1,000 feet. 
According to the Aeronautical Information Manual, every aircraft generates vortices, that can cause an uncommanded roll that exceeds the roll-control authority of the encountering airplane. 
When the accident airplane was about 20 feet above the ground, it suddenly rolled right, (faster than a full application of aileron could counteract,) and the right wing contacted the ground. 
The helicopter transitioned to hovering flight near the threshold, about 30 seconds before the accident airplane. 
Landing helicopters produce a pair of strong, high-speed trailing vortices similar to larger fixed wing aircraft.
