The pilot is chief pilot for a flight school, and reported that a renter pilot had made an emergency landing in a cow pasture in the accident airplane after running out of fuel. 
The pilot applied right rudder and aileron but was not able to stop the turn. 
No mechanical discrepancies were found with any airframe or engine system. 
His airspeed was in the 50-knot range, but about 35 to 40 feet agl, the airplane began to settle while still in an 18- to 20-degree left bank. 
The airplane sat in the field unattended over the weekend. 
The pilot planned to transport the airplane back to the airport. 
The airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted. 
The pilot stated that the winds alternated from calm to light and variable at 1 to 2 knots at the time of the accident. 
The left wing tip impacted the ground, followed by the nose of the airplane. 
The stall warning indicator did not activate at any time. 
He put in fuel and performed a preflight and control check with no noted discrepancies. 
A postcrash examination revealed that the flaps, ailerons, and rudders operated normally. 
He reported that the takeoff and initial climb out seemed normal, but the airplane then started turning left. 
The pilot and the mechanic then moved the airplane to a rough dirt road; the pilot measured the available takeoff distance about 1,500 feet. 
The pilot and one of the school's mechanics assessed the damage; none was found.
