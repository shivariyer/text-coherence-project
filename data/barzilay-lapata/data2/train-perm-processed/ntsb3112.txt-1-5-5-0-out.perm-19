The airline's FAA principal maintenance inspector (PMI) reported that there had been 10 unscheduled removals of DO-328 elevator trim actuators in the last 2-1/2 years for moisture and/or freezing in flight; that maintenance check cards did not address checking desiccant windows for moisture contamination or color criteria for checking the desiccant windows; that teardown reports from the vendor, AVIAC Technologies of France, indicated the paint overspray on the push rods was damaging the actuator quad rings during operation; and that he believed that damage to the quad rings was allowing moisture to enter the actuator housings. 
The captain elected to continue flight to the destination. 
Normal elevator trim operation was regained as the aircraft descended through 16,000 feet on its approach (total air temperature -7 degrees C); the flight subsequently landed without further incident. 
The crew lost elevator trim after leveling at flight level (FL) 310, and they had to hold continuous control pressure to maintain level flight. 
Postflight inspections of the elevator trim actuators by FAA inspectors revealed paint overspray on the elevator trim actuator push rods, scoring and corrosion on the push rods, and white desiccant windows on the actuators. 
Total air temperature was -50 degrees C at altitude.
