A passenger reported that the pilot 'pulled pitch right before the landing and we landed with one medium bump and then followed very quickly with another medium bump with a loud sound with it.' 
The reason for the spline wear was not determined. 
The passenger further reported that the landing attitude was 'relatively normal;' however, 'it was possibly a little more pitched up than normal.' 
The pilot initiated an autorotation to a grassy area, 'flared the aircraft, and placed it in six to eight inches of water.' 
According to the engine manufacturer's metallurgist, 'severe spline wear led to [the] spiral fatigue failure of the Spur Adapter Gearshaft and Compressor Adapter Coupling.' 
A main rotor blade contacted the tailboom, partially separating it aft of the horizontal stabilizer. 
An examination of the engine revealed that the Spur Adapter Gearshaft was fractured at the forward splines. 
About 150 feet agl and 60 knots, as the helicopter was accelerating, the pilot heard a loud 'bang,' and the low rotor rpm and engine out audio warning activated.
