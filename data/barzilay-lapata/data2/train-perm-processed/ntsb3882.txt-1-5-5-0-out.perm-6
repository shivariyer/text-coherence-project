The engine, a Lycoming O-320-E2A, had 1,649 hours since overhaul at the time of the accident and had received an annual signoff 8 months and 27 flight hours before the accident. 
The aircraft came to rest in a ditch beside the road. 
The pilot was able to restart the engine, but oil then started coming from under the cowling. 
During the landing roll, the aircraft's left wing struck a road sign that the pilot could not see, causing the aircraft to leave the road. 
The pilot shut the engine down and performed a forced landing on a road. 
A hole in the top of the engine crankcase was also observed at this location, which the examination report stated was 'probably caused by [the] brass plug being pushed out by [the] crank shaft lobe.' 
As the windshield was covered with oil, the pilot's forward visibility was impaired during the forced landing. 
A post-accident examination of the aircraft's engine revealed damage to the number 1 piston, with the wrist pin brass plug missing. 
About 30 minutes after takeoff, while cruising at 6,500 feet, the engine began to lose RPM and subsequently stopped.
