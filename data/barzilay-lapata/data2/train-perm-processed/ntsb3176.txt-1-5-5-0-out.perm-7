Postcrash examination of the aircraft structure and flight control systems revealed no preimpact failure or malfunction. 
After takeoff, the pilot transmitted to ATC controllers that he had lost power in an engine. 
Since purchasing the aircraft, he had logged 2.5 hours of transition/checkout in the airplane and had flown it for a total of about 22 hours, mostly on 'sight seeing flights.' 
The left propeller was found in the feathered position, and the right propeller was found in a high blade angle. 
At the time the aircraft was purchased by the pilot in March 1996, he had not flown for about 10 years. 
Teardown examination of the engines and propellers showed no findings that would have resulted in engine or propeller malfunction or failure. 
The aircraft's nose dropped in the right turn, and the aircraft crashed nose first on a taxiway. 
The right propeller had damage consistent with the engine operating. 
He made a steep turn to the left back toward the airport, then a right turn toward the runway.
