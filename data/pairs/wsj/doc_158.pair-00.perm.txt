The GAO, which conducted its insider study in response to separate requests from the chairmen of the House and Senate Banking Committees, recommended that federal bank regulators include a thorough review of insider activities in their next examination of each bank under their jurisdictions.

The GAO also said that insider problems identified by federal bank examiners often went uncorrected from one examination to the next.
