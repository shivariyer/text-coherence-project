Acclaim officials said investors appeared to have overreacted to the announcement, because they had indicated months ago that Acclaim's deal for first right of refusal on distribution of WMS games was likely not to be renewed when the contract expires in March 1995.

Since Acclaim has benefitted greatly from the strength of "Mortal Kombat" and "NBA Jam" sales, nervous investors hammered Acclaim's stock, driving it down $5.375 to $13.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
