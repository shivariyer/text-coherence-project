A.O. Smith, which makes car, truck and farm equipment, said in light of its continuing earnings improvement, management plans to recommend that the board increase the quarterly dividend to 13 cents from 11 cents a share, effective with the May payment.

Sales for the quarter are expected to rise as much as 15% to $335 million to $340 million, compared with $296 million a year earlier.
