Melvin M. Belli and Wendell H. Gauthier are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit on behalf of smokers addicted to cigarettes as a result of the industry's alleged manipulation of nicotine.

A lawsuit was filed against five U.S. tobacco companies, including Philip Morris Cos. and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., following media reports and a government investigation into the alleged manipulation of nicotine in cigarettes.
