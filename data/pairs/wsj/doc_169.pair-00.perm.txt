The Washington-based union said the drop was caused by less money spent on staffing and more on improving facilities, a shift that caused teacher-pupil ratios to increase and classroom services to decline.

The teachers' union, an opponent of the for-profit company, said reading scores dropped by four percentiles and math scores by eight percentiles from 1992 to 1993, while other Baltimore schools scored a one-percentile increase.
