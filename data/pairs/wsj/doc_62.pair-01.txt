Martin Marietta Corp. capped a streak of major acquisitions with an agreement to buy Grumman Corp. for $1.9 billion, increasing pressure in the beleaguered defense industry for further consolidation.

The $55-a-share tender offer for Grumman's 34 million shares outstanding will begin today, following approval by both companies' directors and subject only to antitrust clearance.
