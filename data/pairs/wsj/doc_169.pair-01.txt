The American Federation of Teachers said test scores dropped at eight inner-city Baltimore elementary schools run by Education Alternatives Inc.

The teachers' union, an opponent of the for-profit company, said reading scores dropped by four percentiles and math scores by eight percentiles from 1992 to 1993, while other Baltimore schools scored a one-percentile increase.
