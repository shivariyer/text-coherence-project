Under the proposed split, ITT Hartford and ITT Financial Inc. would form a financial-services division; ITT Automotive, ITT Fluid Technology and ITT Defense & Electronics would form a technology and manufacturing company; and ITT Sheraton, ITT Communications & Information Services and ITT Education Services group would form a third corporate entity.

An ITT spokesman, however, said spinoffs or public offerings "were not the company's rationale or intention for pursuing" a three-division strategy.
