As directed by Elijah Moshinsky with sets by Michael Yeargan, costumes by Peter J. Hall and lighting by Duane Schuler in his debut, this "Otello" pays close attention to the original intentions of Verdi who clucked endlessly over the first production at La Scala in 1887, leaving detailed instructions.

Without ever being wildly inventive, but who expects this at the Met, the staging is traditional in the best sense, avoiding meaningless topicality.
