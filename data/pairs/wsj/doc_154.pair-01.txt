"It looks like WMS is almost making a judgment that Nintendo is going to be a far-out leader again in the home market," said Lee Isgur, an analyst for Volpe, Welty & Co. in San Francisco.

WMS's move is a big blow to its current partner, Acclaim Entertainment Inc., whose stock plunged 28% yesterday, as well as a setback for Nintendo's chief rival, Sega of America Inc., the unit of Japan's Sega Enterprises Ltd. that's developing a rival new machine called Saturn with Hitachi Ltd. and Yamaha Corp.
