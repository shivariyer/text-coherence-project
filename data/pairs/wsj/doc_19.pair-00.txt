Judge Malcolm F. Marsh ruled in federal court in Boise, Idaho, that the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other government agencies responsible for running the vast network of dams and reservoirs on the Snake and Columbia rivers, which traverse four states in the Northwest, broke the law.

The agencies pushed through a dam-operating plan that they knew would kill millions of salmon, whose populations are collapsing throughout the Pacific Northwest, he said.
