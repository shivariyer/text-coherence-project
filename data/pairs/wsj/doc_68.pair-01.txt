This is because lawyers presumably will sift through proposed suits and take on only those with some real merit and thus some real possibility of success.

But that theory ignores the fact that there are "loss leaders" in law just as in retailing; there will always be lawyers willing to take on hopeless causes just for their publicity and client-generating value.
