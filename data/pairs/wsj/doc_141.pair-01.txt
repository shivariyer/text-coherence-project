"It's very difficult in a visual medium to be able to deal with the interior dialogue that goes on, that is an element of faith at work," says Dave Pomeroy, director of electronic media for the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA.

"At best, what we can hope for is television that deals with the ways in which those who have faith convictions act upon those in the world."
