Orders for durable goods -- those meant to last more than three years -- fell 2.6%, offsetting the increase in nondurables and up from an estimate of 2.5% in a preliminary report last week.

Ed Yardeni of C.J. Lawrence called that news "especially encouraging," noting that orders for nondurable goods, or goods expected to last less than three years, were flat through most of last year.
