Fiscal 1993 was a banner year for the so-called Texas Incentive and Productivity Commission, created four years ago, which pays state employees for ideas that will cut costs, boost revenue or improve services.

In fiscal 1993, the commission approved ideas expected to save about $1.1 million annually, more than triple the year-earlier amount.
