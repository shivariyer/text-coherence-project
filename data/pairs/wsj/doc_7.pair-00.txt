Hillary Rodham Clinton's commodities broker was disciplined by regulators for a variety of wrongdoing both before and after Mrs. Clinton's successful foray into cattle-futures trading in the late 1970s.

Robert L. "Red" Bone, Mrs. Clinton's broker at the Springdale, Ark., office of futures brokerage firm Refco Inc., was accused, among other things, of allocating trades to investors in his branch office after he had determined whether the trades were winners or losers, regulators say.
