In the past decade, gross gambling revenues have exploded to more than $30 billion from less than $14 billion, according to securities firm Wertheim Schroder & Co. and Christiansen/Cummings Associates, a consulting firm.

Meanwhile, people's impressions of the industry are being shaped by places like the Foxwoods casino on the Mashantucket Pequot reservation in Connecticut, with its overflowing crowds, and the lavish theme-park-style casinos that continue to open in Las Vegas.
