Named to the board were Ramon Lopez, 60 years old, and Daniel J. Monticello, 38, the company's vice president, research and development.

The company said William M. Haney III resigned from the board to focus his attention on Molten Metal Technology, where he is chairman and chief executive officer.

Mr. Haney will remain an adviser to the board and a consultant to the company.

Mr. Lopez was formerly vice president, safety, environment and technology, for a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.

This biotechnology company elected two new board members and said a former board member resigned, bringing the total number of directors to nine.
