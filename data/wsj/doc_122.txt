A $40 billion, 10-year plan to modernize the Russian telephone system is slowly moving off the drawing board and coming closer to financial reality, according to Western executives.

U S West Inc. said yesterday that it has accepted a Russian invitation to become an investor and the U.S. partner in a joint-stock company that Moscow is forming to build and manage a new, nationwide telephone network.

The Englewood, Colo., telephone company will likely be joined as a partner in the project by France Telecom and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, with which the Russians are still negotiating investment terms.

For all three, still to be decided is how much of their own capital they will commit as seed money for the venture.

Victor Pavlenko, head of U S West's Russian investment unit, declined to estimate his company's likely investment.

He said Russian officials have indicated they would like the three Westerners to hold 25% to 40% of the joint-stock company's equity -- though that would be just an as-yet undetermined fraction of the project's total financial package.

Russian companies, including state long-distance carrier Rostelecom, would hold the venture's remaining equity.

And the Russians are hoping also to enlist Western banks and aid agencies.

If the Russians actually pull it off -- and that's still a big if, given the project's vast cost and political complexity -- it would be the world's biggest telephone-engineering venture.

The project is dubbed "50x50" for the 50,000 kilometers, or 31,000 miles, of new cable and 50 new telephone exchanges originally planned; but it has since grown into a remake of most of Russia's overloaded, underdeveloped phone system.

Over 10 years, the Russian Ministry of Posts and Communications aims to crisscross the country in new long-distance fiber-optic cables and microwave links, and install 20 million new local phone lines -- nearly doubling the current number.

But there remains a question of how much growth there is, realistically, given Russia's severe economic and political problems.

"Clearly, Russia needs a modern telecommunications network -- but at what cost?," says Marion Boucher of Bear, Stearns & Co., a New York-based telecommunications analyst.

"It could turn into a long-term play at the expense of bond- and stock-holders that takes money on top of money."

Even some of the project's Western supporters say the Russians will probably have to cut back the venture's cost and scale -- especially with the country's mounting political travails spooking many potential investors.

Moscow's $40 billion funding target "is much too high," said one senior Deutsche Telekom official.

He said the German phone company intends to participate with France Telecom in the project.
