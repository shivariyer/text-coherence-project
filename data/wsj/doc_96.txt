Mexican telecommunications giant Telefonos de Mexico SA, or Telmex, said it signed a new annual wage and benefits agreement with its principal labor union.

The agreement provides for a 5% nominal increase in wages and a 3% nominal increase in benefits.

Telmex and the union also renewed their so-called Productivity Agreement, which provides incentives for worker productivity increases.
