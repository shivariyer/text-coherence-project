El Paso Natural Gas Co. said it will take a first-quarter charge of $12 million, or 33 cents a share, to cover the company's potential exposure from a court decision regarding rates El Paso charged an Amoco Corp. unit.

The court has requested briefs to determine the amount of refunds to which Amoco might be entitled.

"I can tell you we are very disappointed," an El Paso spokeswoman said, "and we plan to aggressively pursue an appeal."

In the first quarter a year ago, El Paso had net income of $30.8 million, or 83 cents a share, on revenue of $210.9 million.

The company also said that its management doesn't expect the outcome to have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or future results.

The company said the Delaware Chancery Court supported a claim by Amoco Production Co. for lower gathering rates for some of its production dating back to Nov. 1988.

Amoco said trial evidence indicated that past damages would be approximately $17 million, and the decision could affect current and future rates.
