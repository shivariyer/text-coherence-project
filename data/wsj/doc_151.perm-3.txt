The phones in those cars will have a button that automatically dials law-enforcement officials, who also can track a driver's location.

The pilot program, Project Northstar, is to begin early next month in 60 Avis rental cars at New York's LaGuardia Airport.

A project spokesman declined to give the cost of the program.

Avis Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph V. Vittoria said if the program is successful, the car-rental company may extend it to southern Florida and other U.S. metropolitan areas where tourist and business-traveler security has been an issue.

About half the vehicles also will have computerized tracking devices that pinpoint the caller's location.

Avis will contribute cars, while Nynex will provide telephone equipment and service.

Avis Inc. and Nynex Corp. are launching a joint project that gives rental-car drivers free cellular-phone access to emergency aid and traveler information.

By pushing a button on a cellular phone, customers will reach service representatives who help with problems such as finding a bank, gas station or hospital.
