Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce unveiled a five-year plan to expand its global investment banking capabilities in order to reduce the bank's dependence on traditional corporate lending.

It will give it a stronger balance sheet, and it will enhance its profits."

Canadian Imperial said the combined organization will offer customers a wider selection of underwriting and investment banking services, including equity, debt, derivatives and currency products.

The bank, which last year generated about two-thirds of its revenue from lending money, has targeted reducing this to about half of total revenue by the end of the decade.

Al Flood, the bank's chairman and chief executive officer, said the reduced reliance on traditional credit products "will make Canadian Imperial a stronger company.

"The corporate banking performance over the last 10 years has not been acceptable on a risk/return basis.

On the other hand, we've seen excellent growth and returns in our investment banking operations," said John Hunkin, Canadian Imperial's president in charge of corporate and investment banking.

As part of the plan, Canadian Imperial said it will set up a new entity, which hasn't yet been named, to contain the bank's existing corporate and investment banking operations, as well as those of Wood Gundy Inc., a Toronto securities firm that is 75%-owned by the bank.

The new company will continue to operate out of the bank's offices in Toronto, New York, and various European and Asian cities.
