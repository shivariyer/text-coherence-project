ITT Corp. is contemplating reorganizing the company into three separate operating businesses.

In ITT's annual report, Rand V. Araskog, chairman, president and chief executive officer, tells shareholders the company is thinking of grouping its various businesses into three more formal operating clusters: manufactured products, financial services and a third unit centered on the Sheraton hotels group.

Some analysts said the change could position the company for possible spinoffs or offerings of the divisions.

ITT recently spun off its Rayonier Inc. forest products unit to shareholders and announced plans to offer part of its ITT Educational Services unit to the public.

An ITT spokesman, however, said spinoffs or public offerings "were not the company's rationale or intention for pursuing" a three-division strategy.

Under the proposed split, ITT Hartford and ITT Financial Inc. would form a financial-services division; ITT Automotive, ITT Fluid Technology and ITT Defense & Electronics would form a technology and manufacturing company; and ITT Sheraton, ITT Communications & Information Services and ITT Education Services group would form a third corporate entity.

Separately, ITT said it completed the sale of its ITT PowerSystems unit to Charter Power Systems Inc., Plymouth, Mass.

Terms weren't disclosed.

PowerSystems, a unit of ITT Defense & Electronics, makes and sells custom power supplies for the computer, office equipment and telecommunications markets.
