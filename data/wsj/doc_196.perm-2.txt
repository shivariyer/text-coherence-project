Closing is expected in May.

MacMillan Bloedel estimates the transaction could be worth 320 million Canadian dollars (US$232.6 million), including C$240 million from the share sale and a debt component of C$80 million.

The forest-products concern will transfer its kraft pulp mill in Nanaimo, British Columbia, and its pulp-marketing business to the new company, Harmac Pacific Inc.

The purchase price will be payable to MacMillan Bloedel in two installments, the first on closing and the second a year later.

Harmac Pacific's 15 million common shares will be offered to the public on an installment-receipt basis by an underwriting group led by RBC Dominion Securities Inc.

MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., Vancouver, British Columbia, said it will form a new pulp company and plans to offer all the unit's shares to the public in Canada.

Harmac Pacific will have about C$200 million in sales this year and will employ 710 people.
