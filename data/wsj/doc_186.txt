Losses mounted in the small-company group, sending prices to their fifth straight decline and to their lows for the year in extremely active trading.

The Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization issues fell 4.59, or 1.79%, to 252.45, its worst level this year.

Its previous 1994 closing low was 256.53 on Jan. 3.

But the barometer bounced back from an early slide to 251.82 early in the session when the Big Board's "uptick rule" kicked in after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 50 points.

The Dow industrials later worked higher to about a three-point deficit before again toppling 50 points and triggering the rule, which restricts program trading, for a second time.

The blue chip indicator fell 72.27, or 1.95%, to 3626.75.

On the Nasdaq Stock Market, more weakness in the technology group and flagging financial stocks hit the Composite Index, sending it down 10.38, or 1.37%, to 744.91.

The index, which fell as low as 14 points, hit a year-to-date low for a second straight session.

Nasdaq declining issues overwhelmed advancers, 2,425 to 922, on Nasdaq National Market volume of 349,445,000 shares and total volume of 398,194,000, its second highest one-day tally ever.

On Tuesday, National Market turnover was at 271,798,700 shares and total volume was 309,556,000.

Already-battered equities fell under more pressure this morning after influential Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Elaine Garzarelli reportedly told her sales force that the stock market's slide so far could deepen to a 10% to 15% correction.

Since the last time all three indexes posted gains a week ago, the Russell 2000 has slid 17.76, or 6.57%; the Nasdaq Composite 51.28, or 6.44%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 242.71, or 6.27%.

In addition, several large brokerage firms in the past couple of days have recommended that investors cut their stock exposure and raise their cash holdings.

In the technology group, Dataware Technologies, a Cambridge, Mass., software company, slid 1 1/4 to 8 3/4; Reliability, a Houston integrated circuits equipment maker, gave up 3/8 to 3; and Zeos International, a Minneapolis microcomputer concern, dropped 3/8 to 3.

Navarre plunged 2 1/32, or 31%, to 4 19/32.

The Brooklyn Park, Minn., home-entertainment products concern said it expects to report a fourth-quarter loss today of 13 cents to 17 cents a share, compared with analysts' expectations of a one-cent-a-share profit.

The company reported a loss of four cents a share a year earlier.

Titan Wheel International slipped 1 1/2 to 27 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Quincy, Ill., company said its Dico subsidiary reached a conceptual agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency for recent hazardous waste cleanup disagreements between the unit and the agency.

In merger news, Duty Free International fell 1 1/4 to 14 3/4 on the Big Board after it said it had entered a definitive agreement to acquire Inflight Sales Group for $60 million in cash and $10 million in notes, with additional future payments based on reaching earnings objectives.

Duty Free, Ridgefield, Conn., also said it expects fiscal first-quarter earnings of between eight cents and 11 cents a share due to weakness in its Northern Border Division.

Last year the company posted net income of 19 cents a share for the same quarter.

IGI, Buena, N.J., slipped 3/4 to 11 1/4 on the American Stock Exchange.

The animal health products company said its board approved a plan for the tax-free spinoff of the company's biotechnology operations to IGI shareholders, subject to a favorable tax ruling from the IRS.

Amfed Financial, Reno, Nev., fell 2 to 22.

The company said it has agreed to buy First Western Financial, Las Vegas, for about $65 million, or $10.25 a share.

First Western jumped 1 3/4 to 9 1/4.

Much of the rest of the rate-sensitive group got pummelled as bonds let go of their early gains.

BSB Bancorp, Binghamton, N.Y., fell 1 to 22 3/4; CitFed Bancorp, Dayton, Ohio, 1 1/4 to 24 3/4; and Class A shares of Financial Benefit Group, Boca Raton, Fla., slipped 1/8 to 4 1/8.

A notable gainer in a day of decliners was Sheffield Medical Technologies, which rose 1/2 to 7 1/2 on the Amex.

The Houston company said it received a Canadian patent covering the red blood cell RBC-CD4 and Liposome-CD4 technologies to treat HIV infection and AIDS.

In general, "People are just confused and indecisive, so they're getting out of positions," said Mike Rail, head of institutional sales trading at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.

But he added that smaller stocks finished above their session lows due to some bottom-fishing.

"I think the market has adopted a more bearish stance, and we could see some testing of trading bottoms tomorrow," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president at Reich & Co.

"There's probably more selling to come, because investors appear ready to more rapidly reduce their exposure to stocks.

The wild guessing by analysts of how big the correction is going to be, is adding pressure."
