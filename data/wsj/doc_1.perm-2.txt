-- The scientific basis for the ban was solid then and still stands.

The decision was not based on any claim of human carcinogenicity.

DDT is a highly persistent chemical that moves up the food chain, and it accumulates in the fatty tissue of humans.

The administrator of EPA has no authority to restrict the use of pesticides outside of the U.S.

The direct ecological effect, and the basis for the decision, was its proven impact on the thickness of egg shells of raptors, birds such as the brown pelican and the peregrine falcon.

In fact, DDT was used for years after the 1972 decision in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) to effectively deal with the exact same problem that exists in Ghana.

In this country in 1972, the risks to our environment, in my opinion, outweighed the benefits of continued use of DDT, primarily on cotton.

Dr. Steinberg should know that, and making wild accusations adds nothing to the necessary debate about a more rational approach to environmental regulation.

Let me address them one more time:

That is a political decision in the classic sense -- the only context in which politics played a role.

The EPA administrator is charged by statute with weighing the benefits against the risks of the use of pesticides.

Dr. Steinberg is simply wrong on this point.

-- The ban on DDT applied only to its use in the U.S., not to any other country.

-- I plead guilty to making a "political" decision . . . small "p" political.

The DDT decision made provision for its emergency use in the U.S.

It was used subsequently in Oregon on a tussock moth infestation.

Like DDT itself, misconceptions about the 1972 decision to cancel certain uses of the chemical are remarkably persistent.

Dr. Fredric M. Steinberg's March 7 Letter to the Editor about the ravages of malaria in Ghana embodies most of them.

Were this statute the law of the land in Ghana, my decision as applied there would have been different.
