French pay-television group Canal Plus SA reported a 9% rise in 1993 earnings, to 1.2 billion francs ($209.3 million) from 1.1 billion francs a year earlier.

The result was in line with the company's forecasts.

Revenue rose 9% to 8.67 billion francs from 7.94 billion francs.

Operating profit fell 2.5% to 1.65 billion francs.

Canal Plus benefited from a gain of 133 million francs related to the sale of a 20% stake in its Canal satellite unit.

Looking ahead, Canal Plus has warned that 1994 net income could be down by as much as 20% because of accelerated investments.

The government at one point was threatening to extract some 450 million francs from Canal Plus, to be pumped into the country's ailing cable-TV network.

In a statement yesterday, Canal Plus would only say that it conservatively projects profit before nonrecurring items to be about one billion francs this year.
