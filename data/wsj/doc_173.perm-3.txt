Canal Plus benefited from a gain of 133 million francs related to the sale of a 20% stake in its Canal satellite unit.

Revenue rose 9% to 8.67 billion francs from 7.94 billion francs.

In a statement yesterday, Canal Plus would only say that it conservatively projects profit before nonrecurring items to be about one billion francs this year.

The government at one point was threatening to extract some 450 million francs from Canal Plus, to be pumped into the country's ailing cable-TV network.

Looking ahead, Canal Plus has warned that 1994 net income could be down by as much as 20% because of accelerated investments.

The result was in line with the company's forecasts.

French pay-television group Canal Plus SA reported a 9% rise in 1993 earnings, to 1.2 billion francs ($209.3 million) from 1.1 billion francs a year earlier.

Operating profit fell 2.5% to 1.65 billion francs.
