Partners Oil Co. said merger negotiations with Midwest Energy Cos. of Tulsa, Okla., have been terminated.

The oil and natural-gas company also said Midwest Energy no longer plans to acquire the 38.2% shareholder interest in Partners Oil held by Magic Circle Energy Corp., a closely held oil and natural-gas company based in Oklahoma City.

A spokesman for Midwest Energy, also an oil-and-gas concern, said it and Partners Oil failed to agree on terms for the merger.

A Partners Oil spokesman wasn't available immediately for comment.
