Ameritech Corp. picked ADC Telecommunications Inc. to supply the video delivery system for its $4.4 billion interactive project, giving ADC a contract valued at up to $100 million over the next five years.

ADC is the first vendor named by the Chicago regional Bell phone company for the project, aimed at building interactive networks in 132 communities across a five-state territory in the Midwest.

Ameritech has reportedly tapped Digital Equipment Corp. over International Business Machines Corp. to provide video-server equipment for those networks.

Video servers digitize, store and distribute movies and other interactive fare over phone lines.

An Ameritech spokesman wouldn't comment.

Separately, Bell Atlantic Corp. said it will open a multimillion dollar digital production center in Reston, Va., to produce interactive multimedia television programs.

The Reston facility, scheduled to be open in July, will act as an extension of Bell Atlantic's full-service experimental network in nearby Arlington, Va., which delivers telephone, data and video services over a single phone line.

Bell Atlantic plans to offer interactive video services to 1.2 million homes by the end of next year.
