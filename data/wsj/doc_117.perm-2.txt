The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 1.6750 marks, up a bit from 1.6735 marks.

The dollar dropped against the yen yesterday on a sell-off sparked by continuing worries over escalating U.S.-Japan trade tensions, but the fall was cushioned in part by repeated Bank of Japan intervention.

About noon Thursday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 102.88 yen and at 1.6735 marks.

The Canadian dollar has been under enormous pressure from Japanese disinvestment, primarily from the repatriation of foreign assets prior to Japan's March 31 fiscal year end.

The dollar's fall against the yen was precipitated by the critical reception accorded by the U.S. to Japan's market-opening measures that are intended to slash that nation's gaping trade surplus.

The dollar registered its 1994 low of 101 yen in the aftermath of the Feb. 11 collapse of U.S.-Japan trade talks.

The German central bank announced it had allocated repos at 5.76% -- a shaving of four basis points from the week before.

Canada's currency also has been hurt by the lack of any serious attempt to cut the nation's budget deficit, traders said.

Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar continued to set new seven-year lows, despite repeated attempts by the Bank of Canada to support the currency.

"The dollar tried to go over 1.6800 marks, but it just couldn't hold it," said Earl Johnson, vice president at Harris Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago.

The dollar made little headway against the mark after failing to stay above key resistance levels following the Bundesbank's latest cut in its securities repurchase, or repo, rate.

The market shook off a rumored line-in-the-sand, at 103 yen, drawn by the Bank of Japan, and which sent the dollar scurrying to an intraday low of 102.85 yen.

Any sign of U.S.-Japan trade tensions tends to weaken the dollar, as market participants bet the U.S. will renew pressure for a strong yen as a way to bring about shrinkage in Japan's huge trade surplus.

The U.S. currency managed somewhat larger gains against sterling, which has been wounded this week on market anxieties about the future of British Prime Minister John Major's leadership.

The mark remained relatively weak against most European currencies.

Sterling was trading at $1.4790, down from $1.4845.

"The dogfight is now on, and we'll see aggressive trades push the dollar to 101 yen," said Angelo Evangelista, vice president, corporate foreign exchange, at the Bank of Boston.

But with market sentiment overwhelmingly negative toward the dollar, it gyrated further and further below key technical support at 103 yen.

Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 102.85 yen, down from 103.13 yen late Tuesday in New York.

The U.S. dollar was at 1.3791 Canadian dollars late yesterday, up from 1.3760 Canadian dollars late Tuesday.

He added that the dollar's inability to sustain a significant advance frustrated the market, and sent the U.S. currency drifting downward.

Meanwhile, the dollar failed to finish the day significantly higher yesterday despite yet another cut by the Bundesbank in the repo rate, its favored instrument for influencing money markets.

"The U.S. is through accepting vague agreements with Japan," Mr. Evangelista added.

The U.S. currency made an impressive, albeit brief, recovery to an intraday high of 103.65 yen about three hours later on Bank of Japan intervention and what some traders saw as heavy buying by Japanese insurance companies.

Initially, the cut prompted an across-the-board sell-off in the mark.
