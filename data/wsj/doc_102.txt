The Securities and Exchange Commission said it will act Wednesday on a proposal designed to sever any link between political contributions and the awarding of municipal bond business.

The proposed rule, drafted by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, already is being challenged in a lawsuit filed by an Alabama bond dealer who also is chairman of the state's Democratic Party.

The rule would bar bond dealers from doing business with a state or local government entity within two years of making a political contribution to an official of the jurisdiction or a candidate for office there.

It seeks to end what regulators say until recently was a pervasive connection between political giving and bond business.

The board is a self-regulatory body overseen by the SEC.

The commission is widely expected to approve the rule.

At its meeting Wednesday the SEC also will consider another proposal by the board relating to the suitability of recommendations made by muni dealers.
