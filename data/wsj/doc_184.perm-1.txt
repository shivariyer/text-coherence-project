Although the Cato Institute characterized my administration as threatening to disrupt a decade of strong economic performance in North Carolina, it chose to ignore the fact that the previous administration incurred a higher budget growth rate -- 7.8% between 1988 and 1992.

The report also ignored the fact that North Carolina is required by the state constitution to have a balanced budget.

Finally, Cato chose to ignore the fact that North Carolina is one of only four states with a Triple-A bond rating from Standard & Poor's Corp., Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Fitch Investors Service.

Wrong -- it was 5.7%.

Cato also chose to ignore the significant sales and gasoline tax increases.

The report's criteria is equally faulty, ignoring a 30% cut in unemployment taxes last year, which will save businesses $85 million per year.

Taxes have not gone up under my watch.

The Cato Institute deserves the "F." For example: Not included in the article or chart was the fact that the Cato Institute reported the rate of real growth in North Carolina's General Fund operating budget as 8.7%.

A Jan. 31 editorial-page Cato Institute chart gave North Carolina -- and my gubernatorial leadership -- an "F" for fiscal responsibility.

I have submitted nine balanced budgets.
