Between March and June of that year, she said, students advanced 0.88 grade level, compared with the expected advancement of 0.3 grade.

The American Federation of Teachers said test scores dropped at eight inner-city Baltimore elementary schools run by Education Alternatives Inc.

The company, which purchased the schools in 1992, installed one computer for every four children in March 1993, said Lory Sutton, a company spokeswoman.

The teachers' union, an opponent of the for-profit company, said reading scores dropped by four percentiles and math scores by eight percentiles from 1992 to 1993, while other Baltimore schools scored a one-percentile increase.

The Washington-based union said the drop was caused by less money spent on staffing and more on improving facilities, a shift that caused teacher-pupil ratios to increase and classroom services to decline.

The company said the test scores can't be used to assess its performance, because many changes weren't in place until after students had taken the 1993 tests.
