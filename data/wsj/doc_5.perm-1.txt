Since Israel is the only nation in the world that is forbidden a turn on the Security Council, it is up to permanent members such as the U.S. to assure some sort of balance.

The fate of Jerusalem is one of the central subjects of the current talks.

Despite the request of 60 U.S. senators, though, this resolution was not vetoed.

The resolution condemning the Hebron massacre is straight out of the old Zionism-is-racism song book.

Can it possibly play a constructive role?

Since when, first of all, does the U.N. go around condemning the actions of private individuals?

Last year's massacre on the Long Island Rail Road was surely horrific and racist, yet somehow the U.N. didn't feel called upon to pass resolutions.

But this is exactly what the resolution does not do.

The resolution then tries to bias the current negotiations.

Nowhere does the resolution acknowledge that Goldstein has been condemned across the Israeli political spectrum.

"We need to send a strong signal to the extremists in any quarter," Mr. Christopher rationalized.

Syria, Lebanon and Jordan said they would not return to the peace talks unless the resolution was passed (as if it were a favor they were doing for the U.S.), so U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher found a way to abstain from two of the most egregious paragraphs while approving the rest.

This episode demonstrates that the U.N. is hopelessly biased in the Middle East.

But the resolution is artfully worded to call for Israel's withdrawal from the city.

On the contrary, the Security Council resolution studiously lumps together Goldstein and the Israeli government.

If there were any doubts that the 1970s are becoming chic again, they were erased recently when the United Nations Security Council passed a vintage Israel-bashing resolution.

Yet Baruch Goldstein becomes a chance to bash an entire nation.
