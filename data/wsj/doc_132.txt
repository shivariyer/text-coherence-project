Joaquim Pinto de Solsa runs a Portuguese construction company.

He eats at Portuguese restaurants, drinks in a Portuguese cafe, shops in a Portuguese supermarket and watches soccer games between Portuguese teams.

None of this is unusual for Mr. Solsa, a citizen of Portugal.

What's odd is that he does all this in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

"I like Luxembourg, but I have my own way of living," he says over steak, potatoes and Portuguese wine.

"Most of the Portuguese live only inside their community."

With foreigners here making up 30% of the total population of 400,000 and more than half the work force, native Luxembourgers see their tiny country as the future of a Europe without borders -- and they aren't sure they like what they see.

After embracing foreigners for decades as a way to build wealth at a time when Luxembourg didn't have enough indigenous workers, many Luxembourgers now see immigrants as a threat.

Most immigrants haven't dropped their foreign citizenship or assimilated, and some take their income back to their homeland.

Yet, because of European Union law, foreigners won permission to vote for Luxembourg's representatives to the European Parliament this June.

Next year Luxembourg will be forced to change its constitution to let foreigners vote in local elections.

Because of the European Union's guarantee of free movement between member countries, Luxembourg is powerless to stop the immigrants (91% of whom are from other EU countries).

The situation has provoked a rare show of patriotic Luxembourg-for-Luxembourgers sentiment here.

With thousands of new immigrants arriving each year and negative population growth among Luxembourgers, some fear Luxembourg citizens will be a minority in their country within 20 years.

"I want to give the Luxembourgish nationality to my children," says Alexander Roth, leader of the Group for Luxembourgish Sovereignty, which is campaigning against voting rights for foreigners.

"A nation can't be part of united Europe if this means giving up itself."

Concerns have been compounded because Luxembourg is experiencing its first serious bout with unemployment: It's at 2.8% now and could grow to 5%, economists say.

In this wealthy country, where 1% unemployment is the norm, "we are in a crisis," says Jean-Marie Mousel, director of employment administration.

Although Luxembourg has by far the highest proportion of foreigners in the EU, its dilemma will probably reach other European countries as national boundaries disappear.

An EU citizen is as free to switch nations as a New Yorker is to move to Florida.

But with language and cultural barriers, European countries may find assimilation daunting.

"If we want to carry on with European integration we have to find a way to get these communities together and make them mingle," says Jean-Paul Hoffmann, editor of d'Letzeburger Land, a Luxembourg weekly.

Luxembourg's foreign presence can be seen at the Cafe Odeon on Luxembourg City's north side.

The Luxembourgish cafe became a Portuguese cafe a few years ago, and now boasts Portuguese newspapers, television, radio and cassettes.

The Portuguese lunch-hour customers on a recent day say there's little need to become Luxembourgers.

Mr. Solsa, one of the patrons, came to Luxembourg in 1971 but returned to Portugal a few years ago to form his own business.

Now he comes with Portuguese workers for a few weeks at a time when there's work in Luxembourg.

He has no intention of becoming a citizen and doesn't speak Luxembourgish.

Neither does Armindo Antunes Aranjo, working on a road construction crew outside the cafe.

All the workers are Portuguese, except for one Pole.

"I definitely won't stay for good," says Mr. Aranjo, a young man who came here with his family three years ago.

He doesn't speak Luxembourgish or French.

Of the Luxembourgers, he says: "I don't meet them and I don't deal with them."

This is the Portuguese notion of "saudade," defined here as a reluctance to assimilate in hopes of returning to the homeland.

Saudade worries Luxembourgers.

The ADR, a populist political party here, used the lack of assimilation when it opposed voting rights for foreigners.

"We don't want to give voting rights to somebody who doesn't intend to stay in Luxembourg," says Jacques-Yves Henckes, a lawyer running for Parliament.

The ADR also wants Luxembourg to reconsider its policy of encouraging foreign workers.

"When a new company sets up in Luxembourg 99% of the jobs go to foreigners," Mr. Henckes says.

"It doesn't profit our population."

Of course, Luxembourg needs a steady supply of foreign workers to keep its economy running.

And while unemployment is rising, the cause seems largely to be recession and retrenchment; there's little evidence that foreigners are to blame for taking jobs.

Still, tensions grow.

When Joao de Jesus Vaz moved here from Portugal 25 years ago, "we were better accepted," he says.

"Now, with unemployment, there is more distance, more reticence."

The reticence appears mostly over the question of voting rights.

Luxembourg's government, fearing a popular backlash, appealed to the EU for a five-year residency requirement for foreign voters and a 10-year requirement for foreign candidates.

It also won permission to ban foreigner political parties and to keep foreigners from top offices.

The government gave foreigners only four weeks to register for the vote this year and required extensive documentation of their residency.

The result: Only 6,700 foreigners registered -- that's about 3% of the voting population.

That calmed some natives' fears by making the election of a foreigner to the European Parliament in June unlikely, but it angered many immigrants.

ASTI, Luxembourg's umbrella immigrant group, accused the government of wanting to "defend Luxembourg against democracy," says Serge Kollwelter, the group's chairman.

ASTI also points out that foreigners still can't hold many civil-service jobs.

Francis Delaporte, the government's immigration commissioner, says Luxembourg did "the best it could."

He hopes the immigration problem will solve itself; with fewer jobs, fewer immigrants should be drawn to this country.

Even if not, he adds, "there is no real choice about it."

Because of the Maastricht and Schengen treaties, Luxembourg removed the last of its border guards in 1992 and 1993, surrendering all control of its borders.

With no control on its frontiers, Luxembourg has two alternatives: It can encourage the full integration of its foreigners, or it can keep its foreign community separate, risking a clashing, divided nation.

Either way, says Diogo Quintela, a Portuguese engineer who heads the Portuguese Socialist Party in the Benelux countries, "it will be a great modification of their society."

Adds Mr. Quintela: "It isn't possible to have 30% of the population from abroad with a different lifestyle and remain a stable community."
