In previous trade spats, the U.S. was able to win allies in some key Japanese constituencies, such as consumers suffering from the high prices that result from import barriers.

"Protectionism protects industry in this country continuing the way it's going now, instead of trying to excel."

Even Giddings & Lewis Inc., a big U.S. machine-tool maker -- which hasn't made a major sale in Japan since 1974 -- isn't pushing any specific retaliation plans.

The Fond du Lac, Wis., company only says that the U.S. should "closely look at the options available to it."

With the Clinton administration moving to slap trade sanctions on Japan, most of corporate America -- including some companies exasperated with Japan -- is calling for caution and calm.

"There's got to be a lot of different ways to wrinkle this worm around."

A government research institute announced yesterday that it would buy machines for a supercomputer center from several U.S. companies led by International Business Machines Corp.

He says the way for the U.S. to retaliate is to subsidize and promote new product development and automation, so U.S. manufacturers could become more competitive with the Japanese on quality.

"If we can't get their products anymore, it's going to bring our industry to its knees," he warned.

Shevach Saraf, chairman, chief executive and president of Solitron Devices Inc., a maker of semiconductors and other components used by the defense and aerospace industries, warned that "there will be no movement unless the U.S. shows them Japan a strong hand."

Cray Research Inc., the big U.S. supercomputer maker, said the Clinton administration did "exactly the right thing" in breaking off talks.

Japanese officials said the contracts mean six of the past 11 public supercomputer bids have gone to U.S. makers.

That's the only way we will eventually pry open the Japanese market," he said, adding that Guardian sales in Japan "are extremely small compared to the price of doing business there."

Insurance executives had closely watched the trade talks, hoping for breakthroughs that would open Japan's market.

Predictably, firms hurt by Japanese competition were more inclined to support retaliation.

"We support the tough stance the administration has taken.

Cray officials said the company has never had a fair shot in competitions with firms such as Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd.

Though disappointed by the collapse of talks, Edward Hanway, president of Cigna International Property & Casualty, a division of Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., urged caution.

His company wants to see higher tariffs on Japanese minivans and sport-utility vehicles.

Japan's powerful bureaucrats, in particular, are rejoicing over the collapse of the framework trade talks, which they had opposed from the start.

Steven Raymund, chairman and chief executive officer of Tech Data Corp., a Clearwater, Fla., wholesale distributor of microcomputer hardware and software, noted that about 10% to 20% of the products the company sells have a Japanese label, while as much as a third contain Japanese parts.

But the head of the West Palm Beach, Fla., concern said he personally opposes retaliation.

"The guy is going to have to dig in his heels to retain respect at home.

Cannondale executives expect the company's sales in Japan to account for about $5 million of its estimated $105 million in total sales for the fiscal year ending June 30.

Scott Montgomery, chairman of Japan operations for Cannondale, the bicycle maker, argued, "Sanctions are politically powerful, but economically won't make a hill of beans.

Mr. Raymund said it's foolish for the U.S. to retaliate against the Japanese now because of the internal political strain.

"We're satisfied," said one mandarin who just returned from Washington.

"We would be hawks," said Chris Dolan, manager of planning and development at Guardian Industries Corp., which has been selling glass to the Japanese automotive and construction market for several years.

For his part, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa picked up support at home for his defiant stance.

{Toyota Motor Corp.} and the Japanese sell cars to maintain market share," Mr. Wolf complained.

"Be cautious," said Joseph Montgomery, chief executive officer at Cannondale Corp., a Georgetown, Conn., off-road bicycle maker.

Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp., said the rise of the yen to about 102 yen to the dollar "demonstrates the market's expectation that the administration will want to use the strong yen to pry more action out of the Japanese on the trade side."

I would much rather see the yen at a 100 yen to the dollar than trade sanctions."

Steven Wolf, a vice president at the River Oaks Chrysler/Plymouth dealership in Houston, said he would like to see tariffs slapped on Japanese autos and other products, which he believes are dumped in the U.S. "Chrysler sells cars to make a profit.

Others joined Chrysler in the call for retaliation.

"I'm not gung-ho, `let's-sanction-the-hell-out-of-them,'" he said.

Cigna has been selling insurance in Japan since the early 1920s.

Meanwhile, Japan signaled new openness to U.S. supercomputer makers.

"The Japanese prime minister is clinging to power by his fingertips," he reasoned.

Some executives saw the rising yen as a way to solve the trade problem "peacefully" by giving Japanese consumers more buying power and raising the cost of Japanese goods in the U.S.

By and large, though, U.S. businesses -- even those who applaud the Clinton administration's hang-tough stance -- don't want a trade war that threatens to flare out of control.

But this time, the U.S. failed to connect with any Japanese supporters.

Wall Street appears to be following the sentiment of many corporate executives.

High-tech companies that count on Japanese imports grew nervous that the trade fracas will be costly.

Industries hurt by Japanese exports -- particularly the auto companies -- tend to take a tougher line.

"Japan seems determined not to allow a meaningful opening of their market," said Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler Corp. chairman.

The U.S. is choosing the worst possible moment . . . to confront Japanese leadership."

It would impact a variety of industries."

But Paul Dillingham, vice president of government operations, discouraged U.S. retaliation because "it would be a very, very serious step for the U.S. government to take.
