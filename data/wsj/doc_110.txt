Travelers Inc.

Chairman Sanford I. Weill, one of Wall Street's savviest executives, last year exercised stock options valued at $46.9 million, according to the firm's proxy statement.

Separately, Mr. Weill received a 1993 pay package of $5.9 million in salary, bonus and restricted stock amid record profit at Travelers, which owns Smith Barney Shearson Inc., the nation's second-biggest brokerage firm.

But Mr. Weill's 1993 pay package paled in comparison with that of Robert F. Greenhill, Smith Barney Shearson chairman and chief executive.

Mr. Greenhill-wooed away from rival Morgan Stanley Group Inc. last year-received $23.9 million in salary, bonus and restricted stock, the proxy statement says.

(The bulk of the package, nearly $20 million, is restricted stock.)

Mr. Greenhill also received options on Travelers shares that the company currently values at $12.4 million.

In all, Mr. Greenhill's pay package ranks among the highest ever for a chief executive of a Wall Street brokerage firm.

For his part, Mr. Weill's 1993 compensation was 56% higher than the $3.8 million he received in 1992, the proxy statement says.

Mr. Weill also received "reload" options in 1993 that the company currently values at $20.4 million.

These reload options allow executives to receive new stock options any time they cash in options they already own.

The incentive is to prod more productivity by giving executives bigger stakes in companies they run.

The pay breakdown underscores Mr. Weill's strategy on compensation: relatively low cash pay, with a chance to earn significantly bigger bucks if the company, and its stock price, soars.

His total pay package includes a higher percentage of option income than many other Wall Street executives, some of whom earned more in cash pay.

Analysts didn't blanch at Mr. Weill's compensation.

"He's got his executives very focused on stock price and stock compensation," said Samuel Liss, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst.

Mr. Weill and his managers "have done phenomenally well for shareholders."

Indeed, shares of Travelers -- formerly known as Primerica -- have nearly doubled the gains of the Standard & Poor's 500 index since 1988, and far outpaced the stocks of an index of financial-services firms, including money-center banks and insurance concerns, according to the proxy statement.

Mr. Weill's 1993 income from options brings his two-year option windfall to more than $110 million; in 1992, Mr. Weill exercised stock options valued at $63.8 million.

In addition, he held $47.3 million in currently unexercisable options on Travelers stock as of Dec. 31, 1993, the proxy statement says.

Among other Travelers executives, Vice Chairman Frank G. Zarb received $4.1 million in salary, bonus and restricted stock, up from $3.4 million in 1992.

Mr. Zarb exercised $12.7 million in stock options in 1993, and had $954,368 outstanding in exercisable options on Travelers shares as of Dec. 31, 1993, the statement says.

In addition, in 1993 Mr. Zarb received reload options currently valued at $5.4 million.

Travelers President James Dimon received $2.7 million in 1993 cash pay and restricted stock, up from $1.8 million in 1992.

Mr. Dimon exercised $4.2 million in stock options in 1993, and has $4.9 million outstanding in unexercisable Travelers options, according to the proxy statement.

Mr. Dimon received reload options in 1993 currently valued at $4.6 million, the statement says.

Travelers Vice Chairman Robert Lipp had 1993 pay of $2.5 million in cash and restricted stock.

Mr. Lipp also exercised $3.1 million in Travelers options in 1993, and has $4.1 million in stock options outstanding.
