Despite similar efforts, the large carriers so far have made little headway in lowering costs.

However Southwest employees had much higher productivity.

But by the middle of the decade the pendulum swung back, as evidenced by two strikes: the pilot walkout at United in 1985 and the walkout by mechanics, pilots and flight attendants at Eastern in 1989.

When you multiply that figure by thousands of flights each day, the difference is astounding.

Prior to deregulation in 1978, airline labor costs were rarely an issue, since wage increases were simply passed on to the consumer through higher fares.

Pilot wages will fall about 16%, while ground crews' wages will drop about 10%.

The gap in labor costs is the most significant factor in keeping the large airlines uncompetitive, accounting for 60% of the total cost difference between the major carriers and their low-cost competitors.

Labor remains 36% of total costs at the larger carriers vs. 31% at formerly bankrupt and low-cost carriers.

At the low-cost carriers, including Southwest, pilots flew an average of 63.7 hours per month vs. 48.3 hours per month at the largest carriers.

This article is based on a study published in the spring issue of the Journal of Labor Research.

It's not the fault of deregulation, as some critics claim.

New airlines were restricted from entering the market and labor costs varied little among competitors.

By 1992, more than 90% of all airline passengers were traveling on discount fares.

Unless unions become willing to work with management to control costs, the largest carriers -- American, Delta, United and USAir -- may suffer the fate of Eastern and Pan Am: extinction.

In this sense a union buyout like United's is a mixed blessing.

The 1992 average salary of $56,874 for Southwest Airlines employees was almost identical to that of the largest carriers.

As price competition increased, the pressure on large carriers to reduce costs also increased, and the single-largest controllable cost is labor.

Based on 1992 data, the average large carrier would pay $1,200 more in total labor costs alone than a smaller carrier for that single, one-way flight.

A no-frills service called "U2" will also be launched.

Other carriers have undergone similar crises in recent years.

Take, for example, a 620-mile flight between Baltimore and Chicago, a market recently entered by low-cost Southwest.

For unions, of all groups, have the hardest time cutting labor costs.

Another popular strategy -- already employed by Northwest and others -- is to offer equity ownership to unions in return for concessions.

Mr. Dooley is an economist at North Dakota State University.

As carriers like Southwest enter the longer-haul, major business markets -- such as the Baltimore-Chicago route long dominated by American, United and USAir -- price competition makes it extremely difficult for the large carriers to charge higher fares to make up for the difference in labor costs.

And it is productivity -- fewer employees doing more work -- more than wages that separates the two.

Union power seemed to diminish in the early 1980s with the development of two-tiered wage scales for new employees, bankruptcies to avoid union contracts and a proliferation of threats by big carriers to spin off nonunion, low-cost subsidiaries.

What accounts for the troubles?

Without these kinds of changes, the future of airlines like American, Delta, United and USAir remains up in the air.

More recently, the strike by flight attendants at American made it even more clear that in today's competitive marketplace, large carriers cannot withstand the significant loss of market share during even a relatively brief labor action.

Thus, airline workers gained wage premiums that today are still 49% higher than manufacturing employees'.

Recently, competition has been driven by ticket prices.

Unions still hold the upper hand in bargaining power at major airlines, leading to high labor costs, low productivity and lots of red ink.

And the gap is widening: The benefits of two-tier wage plans are lost because the lowest-paid employees are the first to be laid off when the airlines cut capacity.

At United, employees will acquire 53% to 63% of equity and three board seats in exchange for $5 billion in pay, benefit and work-rule concessions.

This is due, first, to the success and growth of such low-cost carriers as Southwest, and, second, to the need for a quick cash stimulus by carriers that have gone through bankruptcy proceedings, such as Continental and TWA.

The basic problem is that, despite a tumultuous 15 years of labor relations since deregulation, very little has really changed.

In an attempt to salvage their company, employees of UAL Corp., United Airlines' parent, are buying out the carrier.

To remain competitive, larger carriers and unions must develop strategies to change anachronistic work rules, contract out work and allow premium pay for outstanding employees.

Instead they are forced into such strategies as offering their own no-frills service, closing small hubs, delaying or canceling deliveries of new planes, retiring old planes, and eliminating management and labor positions.

High productivity provides smaller carriers a 38% labor-cost edge -- and a whopping pricing advantage.
