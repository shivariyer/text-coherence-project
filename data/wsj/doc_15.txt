With the Clinton administration moving to slap trade sanctions on Japan, most of corporate America -- including some companies exasperated with Japan -- is calling for caution and calm.

Predictably, firms hurt by Japanese competition were more inclined to support retaliation.

By and large, though, U.S. businesses -- even those who applaud the Clinton administration's hang-tough stance -- don't want a trade war that threatens to flare out of control.

Some executives saw the rising yen as a way to solve the trade problem "peacefully" by giving Japanese consumers more buying power and raising the cost of Japanese goods in the U.S.

"Be cautious," said Joseph Montgomery, chief executive officer at Cannondale Corp., a Georgetown, Conn., off-road bicycle maker.

"There's got to be a lot of different ways to wrinkle this worm around."

Even Giddings & Lewis Inc., a big U.S. machine-tool maker -- which hasn't made a major sale in Japan since 1974 -- isn't pushing any specific retaliation plans.

The Fond du Lac, Wis., company only says that the U.S. should "closely look at the options available to it."

Industries hurt by Japanese exports -- particularly the auto companies -- tend to take a tougher line.

"Japan seems determined not to allow a meaningful opening of their market," said Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler Corp. chairman.

His company wants to see higher tariffs on Japanese minivans and sport-utility vehicles.

Steven Wolf, a vice president at the River Oaks Chrysler/Plymouth dealership in Houston, said he would like to see tariffs slapped on Japanese autos and other products, which he believes are dumped in the U.S. "Chrysler sells cars to make a profit.

{Toyota Motor Corp.} and the Japanese sell cars to maintain market share," Mr. Wolf complained.

Others joined Chrysler in the call for retaliation.

"We would be hawks," said Chris Dolan, manager of planning and development at Guardian Industries Corp., which has been selling glass to the Japanese automotive and construction market for several years.

"We support the tough stance the administration has taken.

That's the only way we will eventually pry open the Japanese market," he said, adding that Guardian sales in Japan "are extremely small compared to the price of doing business there."

Cray Research Inc., the big U.S. supercomputer maker, said the Clinton administration did "exactly the right thing" in breaking off talks.

Cray officials said the company has never had a fair shot in competitions with firms such as Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd.

But Paul Dillingham, vice president of government operations, discouraged U.S. retaliation because "it would be a very, very serious step for the U.S. government to take.

It would impact a variety of industries."

Meanwhile, Japan signaled new openness to U.S. supercomputer makers.

A government research institute announced yesterday that it would buy machines for a supercomputer center from several U.S. companies led by International Business Machines Corp.

Japanese officials said the contracts mean six of the past 11 public supercomputer bids have gone to U.S. makers.

High-tech companies that count on Japanese imports grew nervous that the trade fracas will be costly.

Steven Raymund, chairman and chief executive officer of Tech Data Corp., a Clearwater, Fla., wholesale distributor of microcomputer hardware and software, noted that about 10% to 20% of the products the company sells have a Japanese label, while as much as a third contain Japanese parts.

"If we can't get their products anymore, it's going to bring our industry to its knees," he warned.

Mr. Raymund said it's foolish for the U.S. to retaliate against the Japanese now because of the internal political strain.

"The Japanese prime minister is clinging to power by his fingertips," he reasoned.

"The guy is going to have to dig in his heels to retain respect at home.

The U.S. is choosing the worst possible moment . . . to confront Japanese leadership."

For his part, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa picked up support at home for his defiant stance.

In previous trade spats, the U.S. was able to win allies in some key Japanese constituencies, such as consumers suffering from the high prices that result from import barriers.

But this time, the U.S. failed to connect with any Japanese supporters.

Japan's powerful bureaucrats, in particular, are rejoicing over the collapse of the framework trade talks, which they had opposed from the start.

"We're satisfied," said one mandarin who just returned from Washington.

Insurance executives had closely watched the trade talks, hoping for breakthroughs that would open Japan's market.

Though disappointed by the collapse of talks, Edward Hanway, president of Cigna International Property & Casualty, a division of Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., urged caution.

"I'm not gung-ho, `let's-sanction-the-hell-out-of-them,'" he said.

Cigna has been selling insurance in Japan since the early 1920s.

Scott Montgomery, chairman of Japan operations for Cannondale, the bicycle maker, argued, "Sanctions are politically powerful, but economically won't make a hill of beans.

I would much rather see the yen at a 100 yen to the dollar than trade sanctions."

Cannondale executives expect the company's sales in Japan to account for about $5 million of its estimated $105 million in total sales for the fiscal year ending June 30.

Wall Street appears to be following the sentiment of many corporate executives.

Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp., said the rise of the yen to about 102 yen to the dollar "demonstrates the market's expectation that the administration will want to use the strong yen to pry more action out of the Japanese on the trade side."

Shevach Saraf, chairman, chief executive and president of Solitron Devices Inc., a maker of semiconductors and other components used by the defense and aerospace industries, warned that "there will be no movement unless the U.S. shows them Japan a strong hand."

But the head of the West Palm Beach, Fla., concern said he personally opposes retaliation.

"Protectionism protects industry in this country continuing the way it's going now, instead of trying to excel."

He says the way for the U.S. to retaliate is to subsidize and promote new product development and automation, so U.S. manufacturers could become more competitive with the Japanese on quality.
