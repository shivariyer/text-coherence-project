In a flash, the paunchy, middle-age Joe is changed into a youthful slugger, Joe Hardy (Jarrod Emick), who easily brings his team to the brink of a pennant.

In "Whatever Lola Wants, Lola Gets," she throws everything she has at him, but the stalwart Joe stands firm.

"Allegro," a 1947 chronicle about a small-town doctor who loses his way in the big city, was less successful, but afforded a rare opportunity to enjoy one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's little-known works.

In order to defeat these odious opponents, Joe signed a Faustian pact with the devil, in the person of a suave character named Applegate (Victor Garber).

The book, by the way, was by Douglass Wallop and George Abbott.

Their chief rivals were the New York Yankees and such players as Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford.

Applegate will never own the soul of Joe Boyd.

I won't tell you how it happens, but it is not giving anything away to say that Joe and his fans have it both ways.

Ms. Neuwirth, however, in addition to having been a star of the television show "Cheers," is a seasoned Broadway dancer and she brings her own brand of vitality to the character.

(I use the term flashy advisedly because his numbers are loaded with actual pyrotechnics.)

Mr. Garber has mixed success as Applegate.

Their sin, however, is not a '90s-style offense such as wife abuse or sexual harassment, but the rather benign transgression of sitting glued to their television sets during baseball season rooting for the ill-fated Senators.

This is the first Broadway revival of "Damn Yankees" since the original production nearly 40 years ago.

With an absolutely first-rate score by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick and an outstanding cast, it was a delight from overture to finale.

But "Damn Yankees" takes place in the U.S. of the mid-50s, so Joe is given an escape clause.

Mr. Wallop died in 1985, but Mr. Abbott is still going strong at 106 and attended the revival's opening night.

Not only is it a centerpiece of act one, it becomes the occasion for a full-blown curtain call in which the cast appear in brand-new costumes created just for that occasion.

Two new features are the rich, upbeat orchestrations of Douglas Besterman and Tom Fay, and the choreography of Rob Marshall.

New York -- In 1955 you could bet against the devil and win.

Director Jack O'Brien knows where the strengths of the piece are and he has emphasized them, particularly the signature song "Heart."

"Lady in the Dark," the Kurt Weill/Ira Gershwin musical, is still to come.

Joe was an avid fan of the hapless Washington Senators baseball team, which occupied the American League cellar year after year.

For the most part, those responsible for the current version have wisely resisted this, though they occasionally introduce an anachronism which strikes a discordant note.

When Joe signs on with Applegate, Young Joe Hardy begins belting them out of the park, and Applegate assumes he will soon control him body and soul.

Joe, however, has the bad habit of drifting back to his old neighborhood, looking longingly from afar at his lonely, bewildered wife, Meg (Linda Stephens).

As for the performers, in the role of Lola it is not easy to erase the memory of Gwen Verdon, and the dance routines that first brought her together with choreographer Bob Fosse.

Watching the revival of "Damn Yankees" at the Marquis Theatre one relishes the familiar tunes of Richard Adler and the late Jerry Ross, but what is most striking is the show's innocence.

Finally, in the last inning of the game that will decide the pennant, Joe can either remain with the team and carry it to victory, or forgo his youthful prowess and join his wife as the old Joe.

Certainly Joe has to agonize: Will he help his beloved team win the World Series or return to his wife?

Even the status of the ballplayers comes as a shock to today's audience; though team members could be media stars, the idea of multi-million dollar contracts was beyond their wildest imaginings.

Particularly in the sequences where the ballplayers first demonstrate their ineptness and later where they show their determination in "You've Got to Have Heart," Mr. Marshall infuses the proceedings with vigor and athleticism, as well as considerable wit.

In the opening number, "Six Months Out of Every Year," a group of husbands is shown neglecting their wives.

But the answer is never really in doubt.

The Washington Senators have long since ceased to exist, having been transformed in 1972 to the Texas Rangers, and the temptation with a new production would be to update it.

"Fiorello" is a 1959 musical tale about the life and career of New York's legendary Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia.

In most other versions of the Faust legend, from Christopher Marlowe and Goethe on down, the victim loses his soul to the devil.

In desperation, Applegate summons his most alluring temptress, Lola (Bebe Neuwirth), to seduce him.

The idea is that for four nights of performances they can recruit a stellar cast that otherwise could not be brought together.

By contrast, Mr. Emick is an ingenuous, appealing Joe with a powerful singing voice.

Also effective are Mr. Kelly and Ms. Stephens.

"Damn Yankees" is a trip back in time, not just to an era of evocative show tunes, but to an era in which people unashamedly looked at winning and losing, at right and wrong, in strictly moral terms.

Lithe and lively, she is a formidable force if not an irresistible temptress.

The first two have been "Fiorello" and "Allegro."

That's what Joe Boyd (Dennis Kelly) did in the musical "Damn Yankees."

He has two flashy musical numbers -- one a solo and the other a duet with Ms. Neuwirth -- that extol the virtues of evil.

The golden age of musical comedy is also the focus of the City Center's new series of concert presentations of shows from the past.

Though he handles the comic moments well, Mr. Garber also conveys an archness and self-involvement that is out of key with the rest of the production.

The real winner, of course, is something so taken for granted in the 1950s that it did not need a label: family values.

The performers are on stage, holding books in their hands, and the story is presented in abbreviated form, but the score is there, not only sung full-out but backed by a 30-piece orchestra.
