The human rights approach, after all, invites criticism.

As in the Soviet Union, there will be a transition in China from one-man and one-party rule toward something different -- perhaps (but not certainly) toward a system where the people begin, genuinely, to have their say.

This process is already under way; the imminent passing of the founding generation of Chinese Communist leaders will only accelerate it.

Not surprisingly, they tend to hope that they will get what they want from the people they already know.

A seemingly attractive alternative, moreover, is an offer: Tone down the human rights talk, and Beijing will become more cooperative in everything from balancing trade to solving the North Korea problem.

Open talk of regime transition in China would stir up the current government even more than human rights does now.

The concealed assumption of current U.S. policy is that Communist power is likely to remain substantially unmodified in China.

The two strongest figures in pre-1949 Chinese politics, Yuan Shikai and Chiang Kai-shek, were both badly hurt by what today would be called "the human rights issue"; Mao Tse-tung and the Communists came to power promising not Communist dictatorship but a "New Democracy" -- a system they claimed would be freer than Chiang Kai-shek's.

Rather, it suggests the opposite.

Ideas of democracy were already clearly articulated in the 1910s and 1920s, and had real political force.

That is no reason, though, for the U.S. not privately to recognize the real challenge ahead, and begin to think about how to deal with it.

The focus on human rights, as currently understood, is in fact too narrow, and based on a misunderstanding of the fundamental challenge the U.S. faces now in China.

But it does not mean that the current implementation of policy is correctly targeted.

Therefore it is important to understand the fundamental soundness, in the Chinese case, of the impulse behind human rights policy, even while conceding that American diplomatic tactics have recently been poor indeed.

Mao never delivered on that promise, but that did not change the aspirations of the Chinese, as the periodic waves of dissent under communism -- beginning with the "Hundred Flowers" of the 1950s -- make clear.

Brave Chinese -- and not intrusive and culturally alien Westerners -- created the issue, and it is they who keep it alive.

This is similar to the view the U.S. took of the Soviet Union not long ago: Mikhail Gorbachev's government, the U.S. believed, would reform Russia and become a partner in areas like arms control.

It will mean developing connections with those who are likely to play important roles -- from dissidents to military commanders.

Human rights improve not so much when dictators release a prisoner here or tolerate a demonstration there, but when political structures change, and laws replace men as ultimate authorities.

The issue with China is not human rights; rather, it is regime transition.

But in magnitude and significance, the coming changes in China will be comparable.

Indeed, the search for a democratic and constitutional order to replace the monarchy is perhaps the most important theme of modern Chinese history.

Human rights are on the American policy agenda not because of Americans, but because the Chinese put them there.

But it will also mean expecting less from the present leaders, while thinking more boldly (and realistically) about their successors.

The danger, as the Clinton administration begins to reconstruct its China policy, is that it will distance itself too much from human rights, and make an about-face into the hands of those who want to discard the issue as an unnecessary obstacle in a key relationship.

Taking regime transition as the core concern will mean shifting somewhat the current U.S. approach toward China.

Knowledge of the current Communist leadership, and relationships with it going back two decades, are the working capital of those Americans who make China policy.

This legacy validates American interest in human rights in China by suggesting that the U.S. is on the right side of history.

But here the U.S. has a problem, the same problem it had with the Soviet Union: over-investment in the current regime.

The lesson of the Soviet Union, however, is that real change in human rights -- progress not only in areas such as the ending of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, but also toward the creation of a more representative political system -- is unlikely to come except as part of regime change.

And they have been doing this not just since the years that led up to the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, but since before the turn of this century.

Some Westerners ridicule it as hypocritical and impractical, while some Asians assail it as culturally insensitive.

They do so whether foreigners support them or not.

On most-favored-nation status, it will mean finding a solution, because an economic train wreck is not going to help China to change.

Mr. Waldron is professor of strategy at the U.S. Naval War College and adjunct professor of East Asian Studies at Brown University.

Paired uneasily with this is the hope that this government can be persuaded to liberalize and treat its people better, as well as to cooperate with American foreign policy in places like Korea.

China will not change in exactly the ways the Soviet Union did.

In sum, it will mean taking as the fundamental criterion of policy this question: How does this help or hurt the prospect of a regime shift in the direction of democracy?

It can look like another ridiculous American moral crusade, and furthermore it may cost money.

The U.S. interest is that it should move in a liberalizing and constitutional direction.
