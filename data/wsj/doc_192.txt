Spectrum Information Technologies Inc.'s revolving door continued to whirl, with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Edward W. Maskaly saying he will resign once a replacement is found.

Mr. Maskaly had accepted the chief executive job a mere week ago from former Chairman Peter Caserta, who took a temporary leave of absence to "clear his name" amid federal investigations.

In a statement, Mr. Maskaly cited media "attacks" for his decision and suggested that he had failed to "restore the company's credibility with shareholders and the public."

He didn't elaborate on the media attacks.

However, Spectrum has been reeling under a host of troubles lately.

Legal difficulties prompted six board members to quit this week, including Mr. Caserta, and a seventh board member has said he plans to resign.

The company is faced with a federal investigation into alleged stock hyping.

And last week, federal postal inspectors raided an affiliated financial-services firm, Paradigm Group Inc., and charged five employees with wire and mail fraud.

Paradigm was formerly run by Mr. Caserta, and two of the four individuals arrested in the raid have close ties to Spectrum.

Mr. Maskaly was mentioned in the federal investigators' complaint in that case.

Mr. Maskaly's announcement came as a "surprise," a Spectrum spokesman said.

"The company has been a lightning rod for criticism and Maskaly realized he's not a permanent solution for what the firm needs."

Spectrum's stock dropped 25 cents, or 8.5%, to close at $2.69 in Nasdaq trading yesterday.

Spectrum's chief assets are four patents that it owns, as well as five others it licensed, mainly covering how computer data can be sent over the cellular-phone network.

Although Spectrum must now struggle with a much leaner top management staff, the resignation of several officers could allow the company to start with a clean slate.

Heiko Thieme, chairman of New York-based American Heritage Fund, Spectrum's largest shareholder, says that although the company's technology is sound, Spectrum needs a "CEO who knows more about technology."

Mr. Maskaly was previously chief financial officer of shoe and handbag company Jasmine Ltd.

Mr. Thieme speculated that Mr. Caserta may eventually quit, and the small wireless company will attempt to regain its credibility by attracting new management.

With Spectrum's stock trading at much lower levels lately, the company may also be a ripe acquisition target, he said.
