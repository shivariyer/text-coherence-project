America Online Inc. said fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 55% due to a surge of new subscribers that has caused the Vienna, Va., company "growing pains."
The computer on-line information service said net rose to $1.2 million, or 16 cents a share for the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $790,000, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose to $21.5 million from $9 million.
The company said it had doubled its subscriber base to 531,000.
But the rapid growth in the service, which provides electronic "chat" forums, news and software, has made it difficult for all customers to get easy access in the last few weeks, drawing some complaints.
The company said broader distribution of its subscription software through bundling agreements with computer and modem manufacturers and increased content has helped boost subscriptions.
While the company declined to forecast profits for the quarter ending March 31, analysts' estimates average 21 cents a share.
They also expect subscriptions to reach one million in September.
