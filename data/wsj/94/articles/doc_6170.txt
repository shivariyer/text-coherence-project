First Fidelity Bancorp. said the stock portion of its acquisition of Peoples Westchester Savings Bank was oversubscribed.
The $235 million offer called for 46% of the Peoples Westchester shareholders to receive First Fidelity stock, and the remainder to receive $40.86 a share in cash.
First Fidelity, based in Lawrenceville, N.J., said holders of about 1.2 million Peoples Westchester shares who had requested stock would receive cash instead; they will be selected by a random lottery.
About 2.6 million Peoples Westchester shares will be exchanged for stock and about three million for cash.
Peoples Westchester operated 31 offices in Westchester County, N.Y.
First Fidelity operates 650 offices in Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York.
