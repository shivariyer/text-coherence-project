Machine-tool orders climbed 8% in January from December as manufacturers continued to seek higher productivity and lower costs.
Orders totaled $356.1 million last month, up from $330.4 million in December, according to the Association for Manufacturing Technology, an industry group.
Compared with January 1993, orders more than doubled from $175.6 million.
But Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York, noted that the January 1993 order level represented one of the year's weaker months.
Still, the most-recent January level was considered strong.
"It just verifies everything that you're reading about the strength of manufacturing, the strength of durable goods," Mr. Lustgarten said.
Moreover, analysts said orders are broadening beyond those from automotive makers, which propelled orders last year.
"All the machine-tool makers are telling me it's spreading out to the general industrial sector," said Alexander P. Paris, an analyst with Barrington Research in Barrington, Ill.
Manufacturers are buying machine tools in part because they aid in boosting productivity and lowering costs.
The economic recovery also is increasing demand.
"You buy machine tools either when you're expanding or you're bringing on new products," said Thomas G. Burns Jr., an analyst at NatWest Securities in New York.
In January, domestic orders showed the most strength.
They climbed 18% from December, to $345.2 million from $293.7 million, and more than doubled from January 1993's $141.1 million.
Orders for export, however, remained weak.
They plunged 70% from December, to $10.9 million from $35.7 million.
Compared with January 1993, orders for export dropped 68% from $34.5 million.
An index compiled by the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association fell 27% in January from December and 6% from the year-earlier month.
An association spokesman said the decline represented a lull in orders after a year-end surge.
The index is based on orders over a three-year period.
