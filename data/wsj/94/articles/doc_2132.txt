Diversified Communications Industries Ltd. said it expects to report losses of approximately $1.2 million for the 1993 fourth quarter and $700,000 for all of 1993.
News of the size of the deficits helped push down the price of the company's stock to close at $2, off 75 cents, or 27%, in trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange.
Last week, the West Palm Beach, Fla., holding company, with interests in telecommunications, said it would likely report losses for the two periods as a result of "accounting adjustments" uncovered in the company's year-end audit.
Yesterday, Diversified Communications said the deficits related primarily to its American Fiber Optics unit and stemmed from three areas: unanticipated losses on contracts involving cable operations in Miami; overstatement of revenue; and understatement of expenses, both in the first three quarters of 1993.
