Yields on taxable money-market funds rose in the week ended Tuesday.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compound yield on taxable funds crept to 2.81% from 2.79%, according to Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass., newsletter.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
The seven-day simple yield on taxable funds inched up to 2.77% from 2.75%, while the 30-day simple yield rose to 2.73% from 2.71%.
The 30-day compound yield increased to 2.76% from 2.74%.
Assets of 644 taxable funds, which include two more than the previous week, rose by $5.69 billion to $478.76 billion, the newsletter said.
Institutional investors accounted for $3.72 billion of the total inflow, while individual investors put in $1.97 billion.
Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments, which include commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs, and Treasury bills, shortened by two days to 54 days.
Walter Frank, chief economist for Money Fund Report, attributed the decline in the funds' average maturity to money-fund managers' anticipation of more increases in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
The average tax-exempt seven-day compound yield crept to 1.98% from 1.97% in the latest week.
The latest tax-free yield is equivalent to a taxable 3.09% for someone paying 36% in taxes and to 3.28% for those who pay 39.6%.
Assets of 345 tax-exempt funds, which include two more than the previous week, rose by $1.28 billion, to $112.79 billion, according to the newsletter.
The tax-free funds' average portfolio maturity remained at 55 days.
