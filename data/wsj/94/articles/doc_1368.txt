Allstate Corp. said its losses from the Los Angeles earthquake would be $600 million, instead of $350 million, becoming the third insurer in 10 days to raise damage estimates.
The stream of upward revisions could nudge Hurricane Hugo out of its spot as the second-largest disaster in U.S. history, with $4.2 billion of claims paid.
Industry experts initially put the quake's insured damage at $2.5 billion, but now say losses could top $4 billion.
And V.J. Dowling, of Paulsen, Dowling Securities Inc., a Boston insurance specialist, believes "it could be $5 billion or more by the time the delayed losses come in" from lines such as business-interruption insurance.
Allstate, which is 80%-owned by Sears, Roebuck & Co., said the 71% upward revision for its Allstate Insurance Co. unit reflects higher levels of structural damage detected in detailed, follow-up inspections of thousands of dwellings.
Allstate still estimates 38,000 claims.
In addition, the company said severe winter storms in the East and Midwest will create pretax losses of about $150 million.
The twin problems of the earthquake and bad weather will cause an operating loss for the first quarter of about 30 cents a share, and a net loss, including realized capital gains, of about 15 cents a share, the company said.
In the 1993 first quarter, Allstate had operating income of $259.3 million, or 61 cents a share, and net income of $320.1 million, or 75 cents a share.
At that time, the company had 431 million shares outstanding; now it has 450 million shares.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Allstate shares closed at $24, down 50 cents.
