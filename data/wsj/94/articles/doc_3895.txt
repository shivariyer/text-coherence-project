Lexmark International Inc. said it has begun selling its portable computers under its own label for the first time.
Lexmark, based in Lexington, Ky., said it is offering three different models of notebook and subnotebook computers, priced from $749 to $3,899.
They will be offered through a toll-free ordering line as well as through a Lexmark catalog.
Previously, Lexmark computers were sold only by other companies under various brand names.
The former International Business Machines Corp. subsidiary also makes printers and keyboards.
