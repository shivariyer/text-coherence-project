Nissan Motor Corp. of Japan said it is recalling 218,000 of its 1993 and 1994 Altima midsize sedans because of a faulty throttle cable that may stick in severely cold weather.
If the throttle cable sticks, the engine will run at mid-range speeds and not return to normal idle speeds, Nissan said.
The recall involves 206,000 Altima models in the U.S., and 12,000 in Canada.
Nissan said five minor accidents have occurred in Canada as a result of the problem, but no injuries.
The auto maker is notifying owners by mail to take their vehicles to dealers for free repairs.
Nissan's U.S. unit is based in Carson, Calif.
