Witco Corp. said it will post a fourth-quarter charge of $60.1 million, or $1.10 a share, to cover environmental cleanup and compliance, expected losses from disposing of some operations and a 4% reduction in its work force.
The charge, which totals $92.6 million before taxes, should result in a loss for the quarter.
But operating profit at Witco "should be close to meeting" analysts' estimates for the quarter of 40 cents to 45 cents a share, or a total of $22 million to $24.8 million, C. R. Soderlind, senior vice president, said.
The company, which estimates 1993 revenue at about $2.2 billion, plans to report earnings toward the end of next week.
The moves are part of a restructuring begun about a year ago by the New York specialty-chemicals concern.
