Maxtor Corp. said it would lay off 500 employees as part of corporate restructuring that caused the disk-drive maker to take an $88.4 million charge against third-quarter earnings.
Currently, the San Jose, Calif., company has 7,800 employees.
Including the charge, which totaled $3 a share, the company said its net loss for the period ended Dec. 25 was $121.3 million, or $4.12 a share.
A year earlier, Maxtor earned $18.6 million, or 59 cents a share.
Revenue declined to $381.1 million from $402.6 million.
Maxtor, one of several drive makers hurt by fierce competition in the fast-moving business, said it will phase out the high-performance disk drives that were its original speciality.
Instead, the company will focus on less-expensive drives used with desktop computers, a Maxtor spokesman said.
Most of the company's product development work will be concentrated at facilities in Longmont, Colo. and phased out of San Jose.
Maxtor also announced completion of a previously announced sale of a 40% interest in the company to South Korea's Hyundai Electronics Industry Co., and several related members of the Hyundai Business Group, for $150 million.
