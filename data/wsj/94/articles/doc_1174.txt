Lomas Financial Corp., saddled with hefty losses the past six months as many homeowners refinanced mortgages it was servicing, said it is considering a sale of the company.
Lomas, which emerged from bankruptcy court protection in January 1992, said it has retained Salomon Brothers Inc. to assist "in evaluating strategic alternatives."
Chairman Jess Hay said Lomas has received unsolicited expressions of interest from firms in and out of the mortgage industry, though no offer is on the table.
Next week, interested parties will be invited for a closer look, a company spokesman said.
Mr. Hay said that although the mortgage-services concern has been able to expand its loan portfolio in the face of record prepayments by borrowers, the company is now willing to consider a sale or merger.
"We've been running very, very fast and investing substantial amounts of money, and essentially we've been running in place," Mr. Hay said.
"One way or another we need to find a way to strengthen our capital base."
In the six months ended Dec. 31, Lomas posted a net loss of $97.7 million, including $80 million of one-time charges for mortgage prepayments.
Analysts have said Lomas's performance has been disappointing, and its common stock has slumped from $10.875 a share in November to yesterday's close of $7.375, down 12.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
