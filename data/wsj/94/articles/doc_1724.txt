Wendt-Bristol Health Services Corp., Columbus, Ohio, said it has extended the expiration date of its warrants currently outstanding to May 1, 1995.
The prior expiration date for the warrants was May 1.
Wendt-Bristol said holders of the warrants, upon exercise of them at a price of $3.75, would receive 2 3/4 shares of the company's common stock and one Series II warrant.
The company said its Series II warrants are yet to be issued.
These warrants, which the company expects to issue after complying with filings associated with certain securities regulations, also have been extended and will expire May 1, 1996, Wendt-Bristol said.
Upon exercise of a Series II warrant, the holder will receive, upon payment of $6, two Wendt-Bristol common shares.
Wendt-Bristol is a health-care concern, with interests in the operation of two nursing homes, six retail pharmacies, a home health-care agency, and, through a limited partnership, an outpatient diagnostic center.
