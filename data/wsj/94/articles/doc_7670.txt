Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. said it is investing in the General Magic Inc. consortium, furthering the group's goal of establishing its operating and communications software as world standards for personal communicators and agent-based computer networks.
The Japanese concern declined to specify financial terms or the size of its stake in General Magic, but said it is becoming a partner "with the goal of developing information services and devices based on General Magic technologies."
The consortium, based in Mountain View, Calif., already consists of U.S. companies Apple Computer Inc., Motorola Inc., American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the world's three largest consumer-electronics concerns, Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands.
"The two biggest telecommunications companies, NT&T and AT&T, have now joined to support a common platform," said Marc Porat, General Magic's chief executive officer, adding that the consortium will also seek telecommunications alliances in Europe.
General Magic has begun shipping a communications software called Telescript, which allows users of such devices as telephones, personal communicators, interactive television sets and computers to program intelligent agents to perform tasks on their behalf, such as filtering or finding information.
AT&T said earlier this month that it will by this summer deploy a nationwide network, called PersonaLink, as a sort of electronic marketplace, messaging service and gateway for device users, and companies that want to provide services to those users.
