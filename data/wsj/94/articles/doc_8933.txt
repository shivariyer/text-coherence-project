California's earthquake temporarily knocked out phone lines and some power, but electronic messages about the disaster were flying thick and fast only minutes after the shaking stopped.
Southern California, awash in computer users who commonly talk to each other through the Internet computer network, was soon tied together with e-mail conversations, rumors and reassurances.
On the Prodigy Services computer bulletin board, dozens of users from around the country rushed in with offers to contact relatives of Los Angeles residents.
Prodigy said 500 messages were posted within the first few hours.
Less than an hour after the quake, people were buzzing on the "Earthquake" channel on Internet, trading news tidbits from television and radio broadcasts.
And a parallel "QuakeChat" channel emerged for people to discuss the events, leaving the other channel open for news.
Internet, the successor of a network built by the Pentagon and designed to withstand disaster, "is remarkably robust," said Vinton G. Cerf, one of the original designers of Internet.
