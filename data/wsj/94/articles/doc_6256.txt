A program administered by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute recommended that emergency departments try to treat heart-attack patients with clot-dissolving drugs within 30 minutes of their arrival at the hospital.
The National Heart Attack Alert Program, a group of scientific, government and voluntary organizations, issued a report calling on hospital emergency departments to reduce delays in treating heart-attack patients.
In a statement, Dr. Costas Lambrew, co-chairman of the program's working group, said, "Not every heart-attack patient is a candidate for clot-dissolving drugs, but too few patients are being treated with thrombolytic therapy," or the use of drugs to fight clotting.
A spokesman for Genentech Inc., a South San Francisco biotechnology concern, said the report holds the "promise that if these recommendations are adopted across the country, you'll see more patients treated with thrombolytic agents."
Genentech, which sells TPA, the most expensive clot-dissolving drug, holds about two-thirds of the market for such products.
