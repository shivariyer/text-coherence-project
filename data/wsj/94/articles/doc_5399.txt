Compaq Computer Corp. said it is developing a program to market its personal computers to educational institutions, including elementary schools, junior highs, high schools and universities.
The move is another in Compaq's continuing efforts to expand its sales into new markets.
The Houston computer maker "has never focused on education or developed an organization to handle it," said a spokesman for Compaq.
The time is right for the Compaq expansion, he said, because there is an increase in the level of sophistication of computer use and a growing need for networking capabilities in schools.
Compaq will establish computer-distribution channels, software partnerships and marketing programs to sell its portable, desktop and server, or networking, personal computers, the company said.
It also set up a new leasing program designed for schools.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Compaq shares closed at $91.625, up 87.5 cents.
