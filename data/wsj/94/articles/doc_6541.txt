The passion aroused by any questioning of the standard version of evolution never ceases to amaze me (Letters to the Editor, Dec. 15, and "A Scopes Trial for the '90s," editorial page, Dec. 6).
Evolution as a serious scientific concept was introduced by Lamarck a half-century before Darwin's "Origin of the Species."
It is accepted by many leading religious thinkers who also firmly believe in a Creator.
All the fuss began with the introduction of natural selection as the mechanism of evolution.
Although credit for this concept usually goes to Darwin, Alfred Russell Wallace is acknowledged as a co-discoverer.
Recent research indicates that Wallace was, in fact, the first one to express this view for publication, but that Darwin carried out some fancy footwork to gain priority for the discovery.
Everyone agrees that wide acceptance of natural selection came with Darwin's famous book of 1859.
But Wallace continued to be the most consistent advocate of natural selection through the rest of the 19th century, while Darwin was flirting with Lamarck's inheritance of acquired characteristics.
The point of all this is that Wallace, after much deliberation, rejected natural selection for the origin of man, and concluded that humans could have arisen only through the intervention of what he called a Higher Intelligence.
On this score I suppose Wallace would not have been allowed to teach a basic course on evolution at San Francisco State.
