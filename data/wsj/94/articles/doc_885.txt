Gentner Communications Corp. said it expects to post a loss for its third quarter after a $400,000 charge related to the recent sale of its unprofitable Audisk product line.
A company spokesman said in Salt Lake City that without the charge, it's unclear whether Gentner would have a gain or loss for the quarter.
In the year-ago third quarter, ended March 31, Gentner earned $31,805, or less than a cent a share, on revenue of $2.4 million.
Gentner agreed late last year to sell Audisk to closely held DHK Group of Cambria, Calif.
The price wasn't disclosed.
Audisk is a hard disk-drive system for storing and retrieving commercials and spots for radio stations.
Gentner said it is "encouraged about being able to move forward without the distraction of Audisk and its historically negative impact on earnings."
