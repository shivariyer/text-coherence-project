Total System Services Inc. said it signed a credit-card processing agreement with BankAmerica Corp. that will increase the number of accounts serviced by Total Systems by almost 20%.
Under the agreement, Total Systems, a unit of Synovus Financial Corp., will provide processing services for Visa and MasterCard credit-card accounts of BankAmerica, based in San Francisco.
Both Total Systems and Synovus are based in Columbus, Ga.
While terms of the agreement weren't disclosed, a Total Systems spokesman noted that the company serviced 35.5 million accounts at the close of 1993.
The new agreement, he said, will add more than seven million accounts, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.
The bulk of the accounts, he added, would be picked up in the first quarter of 1995.
Total Systems provides data-processing services to 114 credit-card issuers in 36 states.
