Several thousand students and workers filed through Paris streets yesterday in protest of government plans to lower the minimum wage, but Prime Minister Edouard Balladur refused to withdraw his proposed reforms aimed at cutting France's record unemployment rate.
Earlier in the day, the leader of the hard-line CGT (Confederation Generale du Travail) union walked out of a roundtable meeting between workers, employers and government officials.
Although the government did later make a minor concession to union demands, concerning which salary index should be used in calculating the new wage packages, a CGT official said yesterday evening that the left-wing union would push ahead with its plans for more demonstrations March 12.
The government's proposed reforms would allow employers to pay young workers 20% less than the standard minimum wage on condition they also provide some form of training program.
Union leaders fear this will encourage companies to lay off older workers.
