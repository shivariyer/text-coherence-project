AutoZone Inc. said its president and co-founder, Peter R. Formanek, 50 years old, will resign, effective April 30.
The rapidly expanding retailer, which operates 855 auto-parts stores in 24 states, named Thomas S. Hanemann, 56, currently executive vice president-stores, as his successor.
The move surprised industry observers and investors, and news of Mr. Formanek's departure helped push down AutoZone's shares almost $2 a share in early trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock closed at $61.50, up 87.5 cents.
Mr. Formanek, who holds about 3% of the company's stock, said he is leaving AutoZone to pursue personal interests.
He will remain a director.
"There's no question AutoZone will miss him," said L. Keith Mullins, an analyst at Smith Barney Shearson.
"But there's no indications of any disturbing trends.
The business continues to be very, very strong."
Under Mr. Formanek and J.R. Hyde III, chairman and chief executive, AutoZone has emerged as a fast-growing retailer.
For its fiscal second quarter ended Feb. 12, the company reported earnings jumped 31% to $20.9 million, or 28 cents a share, from $16 million, or 22 cents a share, a year ago.
Sales rose 25% to $303.2 million.
Mr. Hanemann has been executive vice president-stores since 1992.
He was named senior vice president-stores in 1986.
Separately, AutoZone said its board approved a 2-for-1 stock split, payable April 20 to shareholders of record March 31.
AutoZone currently has 72.4 million shares outstanding.
