Colombia has sold three cellular-telephone concessions to two separate investor groups for a total of $621 million, in another sign that Latin American communications properties are heating up.
An investor group called Celumovil SA launched a $461-million winning bid for two concessions, one of which includes the potentially lucrative Bogota market.
Currently, there is no large cellular network in Colombia.
The investor group includes the large Colombian firm Grupo Santo Domingo; McCaw Cellular Communications; LCC, a privately held Arlington, Va., telecommunications firm; private investors; and Chase Manhattan Bank, a unit of Chase Manhattan Corp., which also arranged financing for the deal.
Manuel Vicente De La Pava, vice president at Chase, says Celumovil will spend $120 million to $250 million over the next three years to get the cellular network up and running.
The group hopes to have about 80,000 subscribers by 1997.
The third concession, in Colombia's Western region, was awarded to the Cocelco investor group for $160 million.
The group is made up of private investors, Telefonica of Spain, and Cia. de Telefonos de Chile.
