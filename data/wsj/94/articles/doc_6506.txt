You reported (World Wire, Jan. 21) that the fashion house Chanel and designer Karl Lagerfeld have put lines from the Koran on some of their summer line.
Then, to placate a handful of Muslims whose delicate sensibilities were offended, they made an instant pilgrimage to Canossa.
In addition to expunging all trace of the offending garments from the face of the earth, they also asked that all photos and TV records be destroyed, all the while denying that they were doing so out of fear of reprisals.
Their actions raise a few questions:
Why aren't the defenders of freedom of speech, etc. screaming bloody murder?
Why was it so necessary to deny that they feared reprisals, when none were threatened?
If in the future they should similarly offend Jews or Christians, will they undertake similar corrective action with the same alacrity, spontaneously, or only if the Vatican starts offering bounties?
Whom do they think they're kidding?
