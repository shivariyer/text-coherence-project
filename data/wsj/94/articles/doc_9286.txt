Electronic Data Systems Corp. said it agreed to acquire a majority interest in Italy's closely held Gruppo S&M, a computer services and software concern in Rome.
Terms were not disclosed, but Dallas-based EDS, a unit of General Motors Corp., Detroit, said the agreement includes an option for it to take full ownership of Gruppo in the future.
Gruppo, which provides software design services primarily for financial and manufacturing concerns, reported 1992 revenue of $56.5 million.
EDS said the agreement gives it entry into the Italian information technology market, the fourth largest in Europe.
EDS said it plans to target the relatively undeveloped market in Italy for outsourcing information-technology services.
