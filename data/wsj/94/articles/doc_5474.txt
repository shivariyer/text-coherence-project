JWP Inc., as expected, said it filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code and said its chairman and chief executive officer plans to resign.
The beleagured mechanical and electrical-construction contracting company said the voluntary filing converts an involuntary petition filed in December by three holders of JWP's 7 3/4% convertible subordinated debentures.
JWP said the operations of its units will be unaffected by the bankruptcy proceeding, which applies to the holding company.
JWP also said it had reached an agreement for $35 million of debtor-in-possession financing with Belmont Capital Partners II LP, subject to court approval and certain conditions.
Belmont's general partner is an affiliate of Fidelity Investments.
Under JWP's reorganization plan, creditors holding about $600 million of claims and debt would receive about $110 million of recourse debt, $50 million of nonrecourse debt and 100% of the company's equity.
Holders of subordinated debt, common and preferred stock and warrants wouldn't have any stake in the restructured company.
Separately, Edward Kosnik said he will resign as chairman and chief executive of JWP "to pursue other personal and business activities."
In a statement, Mr. Kosnik said the filing of the prearranged Chapter 11, "which has the support of JWP's principal creditors, is an appropriate time to bring on board a new chief executive to lead a reorganized JWP into the future."
Mr. Kosnik will continue as chief executive for a transition period, JWP said.
A successor has not been named.
Separately, JWP said Jeffrey M. Levy, senior vice president, was named acting chief operating officer.
