The Schroder investment group plans a secondary offering of 12 million common shares of Mitel Corp. at 7.60 Canadian dollars (US$5.61) a share for a total of C$91.2 million.
The sale will reduce the group's Mitel holding to 23 million shares, or 22% of the 105 million shares outstanding of the telecommunications-equipment company.
Schroder said the planned sale reflects its investment strategy of selling investments in an orderly fashion and at an opportune time in order to provide liquidity to its investors.
Mitel's shares closed yesterday at US$5.75 a share, off 37.5 cents, or 6.1%, in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Schroder group initially held 51% of Mitel's shares.
It purchased the shares in 1992 from British Telecommunications PLC, a major British telephone utility.
The secondary share offering, which is being handled by a Canadian underwriting group, will be made only in Canada.
The Schroder investment group includes a group of partnerships advised by Schroder Ventures, an affiliate of Schroder PLC, a British merchant bank.
