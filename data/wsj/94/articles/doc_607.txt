Ameritech Corp. plans to take a $335 million charge against first-quarter earnings, or about 60 cents a share, to sweeten severance terms for cutting 6,000 jobs by the end of 1995.
The work force reduction, aimed at its 48,000 non-management employees, is the first major downsizing announced by the Chicago-based telephone company.
However, Ameritech has been quietly reducing its management ranks for more than two years.
Using a combination of attrition, retirement and layoffs, the company has shrunk its white-collar work force to 17,000 from 26,500 in the past 30 months, John Edwardson, Ameritech's chief financial officer, said.
"There was no formal announcement on that white-collar reduction," Mr. Edwardson said.
"Our approach was just to get it done."
In the first quarter of 1993, Ameritech earned $337.3 million, or $1.25 a share, on revenue of $2.8 billion.
Ameritech closed Friday at $39.625, down 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Late last week, Nynex Corp. announced a $1.3 billion charge to sweeten severance terms for cutting 16,800 jobs, on top of $700 million it had already taken to make those cuts.
Mr. Edwardson said Ameritech hopes to eliminate the 6,000 positions by voluntary means.
But he indicated the Baby Bell would be willing to resort to layoffs to meet its downsizing goal, if necessary.
"We hope that won't happen," he said.
Ameritech, which has 67,000 employees, worked out terms of its severance sweetener with union leaders from the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
A pension enhancement adds three years of age and service to the formula for calculating retirement benefits for eligible, non-management employees who terminate their employment with the company before mid-1995.
Union leaders could not be reached for comment.
Ameritech is pushing a plan that encourages competition for local phone service in Illinois, one of five Midwestern states it serves, in exchange for the right to enter the long-distance business.
It also plans to build separate interactive networks in communities across its service area.
