The Federal Trade Commission charged a Bausch & Lomb Inc. unit with violating a commission order against making false claims about its hearing aid.
The commission said the unit, Dahlberg Inc., claimed in a national advertising campaign that its Miracle Ear Clarifier would amplify sounds the user wanted to hear, such as speech, and reduce unwanted background noise.
The agency said the claims are false and violate the terms of a 1976 settlement between Dahlberg and the FTC that prohibited the company from making false claims about its hearing aids.
The FTC asked the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis to prohibit Dahlberg, based in Golden Valley, Minn., from making similar false claims and to order the company to pay substantial civil penalties.
Dahlberg disputed the FTC's charges, saying it believes its advertising for the Clarifier is substantiated.
It filed suit last week in a federal court in Minnesota, contending that the FTC "has no authority to regulate performance and use claims made by hearing-aid manufacturers in their advertising" and that jurisdiction for such issues lies with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Dahlberg added that the FDA is considering adopting "clearer guidelines" for hearing-aid advertising, sales and distribution, and that it is cooperating "fully."
Bausch & Lomb acquired Dahlberg last summer, but the FTC's investigation of Dahlberg had led the Rochester, N.Y., company to lower its offer to $139 million from $158 million.
Last year, the FDA also sent letters to Dahlberg and six other hearing-aid makers, warning that their claims about similar devices could lead to federal charges.
Commission officials said most of the ads have been withdrawn.
The FTC charges against Dahlberg stem from ads that appeared from 1988 through 1992.
