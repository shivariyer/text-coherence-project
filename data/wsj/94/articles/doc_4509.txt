A state court judge, removing a potential roadblock to Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.'s effort to win trash-hauling customers here, declined to issue a preliminary injunction sought by a local hauler who lost customers to the national waste-management concern.
Diane A. Lebedeff, a New York Supreme Court justice, in a decision signed yesterday, denied requests by A.V.
A Carting Inc., a local hauler, and Trade Waste Associations Inc., a group representing local haulers, for a prelimnary injunction against Browning-Ferris.
Gerald Walpin, a lawyer representing the local haulers' group, said that despite the failure to win an injunction, the group plans to proceed with litigation alleging Browning-Ferris took away customers by inducing them to breach contracts with their hauler.
Houston-based Browning-Ferris denies any wrongdoing and says it continues to win customers in New York by offering lower prices.
The New York City market has long been dominated by numerous smaller haulers, some having ties to organized crime.
