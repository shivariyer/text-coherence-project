Demand for trucks in Europe is expected to recover in 1994 after a major slump in 1993, the truck-building division of French state-controlled auto group Renault SA said.
Renault Vehicules Industriels said the French market could grow by 14%, or 4,100 vehicles, this year to about 32,000 vehicles after plunging by 21% in 1993.
The overall European market for trucks of more than five tons fell 22% last year, and all countries, apart from the U.K. where truck sales rose 15%, were affected.
Despite the weak demand, RVI's European market share improved to 9.3% last year from 9.1% in 1992, boosted by growth in France.
