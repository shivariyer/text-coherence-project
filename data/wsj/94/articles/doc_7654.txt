Hearst Corp.'s magazine division said it named Ronald A. Galotti, former publisher of Vanity Fair, to the new post of publishing director of Esquire and Esquire Gentleman.
Mr. Galotti, 44 years old, left Vanity Fair in May.
Although the magazine's publisher, Advance Publications Inc.'s Conde Nast unit, said he resigned to pursue other interests, company insiders said he was forced out after clashing with top executives at Conde Nast.
Hearst said Mr. Galotti will oversee "all aspects of the advertising sales efforts, marketing and positioning" of Esquire and Esquire Gentleman.
Hearst said Alan Stiles will remain as publisher of both Esquire and Esquire Gentleman, but didn't elaborate on how their roles will differ, other than to say Mr. Galotti will focus on the "relaunch" of Esquire under its new editor, Edward Kosner.
Esquire has endured considerable turmoil recently, having abruptly replaced Mr. Kosner's predecessor, Terry McDonell, in September.
Mr. Kosner, longtime editor of New York magazine, was brought in to revive Esquire, which has been losing ground to hipper competitiors, such as Conde Nast's GQ.
Publishers Information Bureau reported a nearly 13% drop in advertising pages at Esquire for 1993.
Esquire Gentleman is a stand-alone magazine stressing men's fashion, while the 60-year-old Esquire continues to carry a wide range of service articles, fiction and other features geared to men.
Mr. Galotti's appointment marks his return to Hearst Magazines, where he was the founding publisher of Country Living, launched in 1982.
He stayed at Hearst until 1986, leaving to become publisher of Conde Nast's Mademoiselle.
