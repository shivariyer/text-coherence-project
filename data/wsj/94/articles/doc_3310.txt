NBC will go it alone in telecasting the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
The General Electric Co. unit shunned the networks' recent practice of taking on a cable partner for the games, citing the value of exclusivity.
"Our six owned stations and 207 affiliates are our most important partners," said NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol in a statement.
This is a gamble for NBC, which spent $456 million for the Atlanta games' TV rights and which lost an estimated $100 million on the 1992 Barcelona games, after paying $401 million for rights.
That year, the network supplemented its over-the-air broadcasts with a pay-per-view cable package, which flopped.
But the value of Olympics programming has been enhanced by CBS Inc.'s smashing success with the Lillehammer games last month.
On average, 27.8% of the nation's 94.2 million television households watched the games over their 16 days.
An NBC spokesman maintained that had no bearing on the decision, however.
He said NBC's stations made "significant contributions" in enabling the network to mount its winning bid, and it wanted to protect their exclusive broadcast rights.
