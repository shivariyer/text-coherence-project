Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said German inflation remained "decidedly too high," and that monetary policy cannot replace needed structural reforms as the source for German recovery in the 1990s.
"Monetary policies cannot steer growth or structural policies," Mr. Tietmeyer said in a speech in Frankfurt.
"It must instead set out monetary parameters that" stem existing inflationary pressures while preventing "the rise of new inflation pressures."
Mr. Tietmeyer's comments are likely to disappoint hopes in financial markets for fresh reductions in German interest rates, particularly after an only modest reduction in the central bank's chief open-market interest rate earlier in the week.
Still, some analysts weren't surprised, given an inflationary 20.6% surge in German's aggregate money supply in January.
Earlier in the day, the government statistics office announced an upward revision in Western German February annual inflation to 3.4% from a previously reported 3.3% rate.
But the final price measure for February was still down from 3.5% in January and 3.7% in December.
February's monthly inflation rate was adjusted upward to a 0.3% rise from January, revising the preliminary 0.2% figure.
The agency also estimated that annual inflation came in at a lower 3.2% rate when excluding the Jan. 1 tax increase on petroleum products.
"Although the inflation rate has leveled off slightly, the 3.4% in February was still decidedly too high, even when accounting for the petroleum effect," Mr. Tietmeyer said.
The text of his speech was distributed by the Bundesbank.
