Heineken NV said profit from normal operations, which excludes extraordinary items, rose 12% in 1993 from a year earlier.
But the Dutch brewer's net income fell 8% last year to 519 million guilders ($270.7 million), because of a one-time gain in 1992 that wasn't matched last year.
Amsterdam-based Heineken said its after-tax earnings from normal operations rose to 519 million guilders from the 463 million guilders a year earlier.
But, including a 101 million-guilder gain on the sale of land in Singapore in 1992, profit slid to 519 million guilders from 564 million guilders a year earlier.
Sales edged up 1.1% last year to 9.05 billion guilders from 8.94 billion guilders in 1992, dragged down by lower beer consumption in Europe and negative currency swings.
