Monsanto Co., St. Louis, said it signed a letter of intent to sell its pyridine pesticide business to Rohm & Haas Co.
The chemical companies didn't disclose terms.
Monsanto uses the pyridine chemical family to make Dimension, which is sold in the U.S. to kill crabgrass.
The chemistry is also part of an herbicide called Visor, which is used in orchards and olive groves in Spain.
In addition, pyridines are used to make a fungicide.
A Monsanto spokesman said it is selling the business as part of a plan to focus its herbicide research on major crops such as corn, wheat and soybeans.
A Monsanto executive, however, said in a published report in January that Dimension wasn't as profitable as the company had expected.
Philadelphia-based Rohm & Haas said the program fits into its lineup of herbicide products, because it concentrates on niche markets.
