Inco Ltd. said it plans to cut about 1,000 jobs at its world-wide primary metals operations, and expects to record a pretax charge of about $20 million in connection with the staff reduction.
The nickel mining concern said it now employs about 11,000 world-wide.
The majority of the cuts, which are aimed at reducing production costs, will come at Inco's Ontario operations.
Inco said the staff cuts won't have any impact on planned production levels.
