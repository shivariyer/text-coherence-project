As expected, Frances Lear pulled the plug on Lear's magazine, the publication for women over 40 which she started six years ago.
Ms. Lear said the magazine's April issue will be its last.
There had been rumors for months that the magazine was in trouble, but Ms. Lear denied until the end that she planned to close it, insisting both to staffers and outsiders that she would convert Lear's into a women's financial magazine.
Insiders say the magazine never made money and cost Ms. Lear more than $25 million, money that came from a large divorce settlement.
Ms. Lear declined to comment about how much money she lost or why she closed the magazine.
In a news release, she said she believes that "the future is in direct marketing products to a mass audience of women through advanced telecommunications."
To that end, she has started Lear Television, whose first product will be a videotape of financial advice for women, due out this summer.
The staff of the magazine took the news with considerable bitterness, especially after learning that they won't receive severance pay.
"People felt stunned, bitter and brutalized," said Larkin Warren, a senior editor at Lear's for two years.
"Frances did a Norma Desmond number telling us how grateful she was, then two guys in suits swept in and said, `You people get nothing.
Just get out.'"
Staffers had to leave the office by 4 p.m., and get permission to take whatever they took from their desks.
