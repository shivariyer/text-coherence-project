Western European car sales rose 6.3% in January.
But because January 1993 sales were abnormally depressed, nobody is yet celebrating a recovery in the sagging European market.
New-car registrations in 17 Western European countries totaled 1,028,910 last month, compared with 967,800 a year earlier.
In just the 12 countries of the European Union, sales rose 7% to 961,840 units from 898,940 a year earlier, according to preliminary figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, an industry group in Brussels.
Following on the heels of a 15% decline in the Western European market in 1993 -- the sharpest collapse in the market since World War II -- the improvement in the January numbers is "an encouraging first sign, but it's certainly too early to say a strong recovery is under way," said Francois Colli, European auto analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London.
Because of tax incentives by many European governments for cars with catalytic converters in 1992, many Europeans had rushed through purchases of new cars in December 1992, sapping demand in January 1993.
Those resulting artificially low levels last January enabled many European markets to show stunning percentage increases in car sales last month, without any real improvement in the underlying market, analysts said.
In the Netherlands, car sales jumped 48% to 66,000 units, and in Spain, sales rose 28% to 198,530 units.
"The January figures are very distorted," Mr. Colli said.
Industry analysts still are forecasting an essentially stagnant market in 1994, with growth of only between 1% and 3% from 1993's dismal performance.
Only in the United Kingdom, where a reviving economy is fueling a surge in auto purchases, did the car market show real vibrancy, with sales rising 20% to 198,530 units in January.
In 1993, the U.K. went against the trend, with car sales rising almost 12%.
Another potential bright spot is France, where a series of government economic initiatives could give the industry a boost.
In January, the French car market grew 15%, with sales of 129,560 units, and some analysts are predicting 7.5% to 10% growth for the year.
