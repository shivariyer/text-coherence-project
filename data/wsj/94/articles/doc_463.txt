Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling 96,300 1990 and 1991 model F-Series pickup trucks equipped with 7.5 liter engines to replace faulty fuel line tubing.
The affected trucks, which represent about 9% of all F-Series trucks sold in the 1990-91 model years, have a section of steel tubing in the fuel return line that could rub against an underbody weld flange.
Over time, the friction could produce a hole that would allow gasoline to leak out, creating a potential fire hazard.
Ford said it has received one report of a fire related to this defect but said it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the condition.
