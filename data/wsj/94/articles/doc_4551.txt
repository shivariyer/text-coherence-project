Regarding your Jan. 19 story about Gerald Hines, the Houston developer, who is asking the public and media not to call the area around his Galleria mall the "Galleria" area ("Please Don't Sue Us, but We Call This a Galleria Story," Jan. 19):
This is ironic, since Hines for years tried to encourage the use of the word Galleria as a generic description of its neighborhood.
But just recently, the threat of a Hines lawsuit forced the owner of a gasoline station to change its name from the Exxon Galleria to the Exxon at the Galleria.
This reminds me of a letter that Groucho Marx wrote to Jack Warner when Warner Brothers tried to force the Marx Brothers to change the name of their movie "A Night in Casablanca," on the grounds that Warner Brothers controlled the title "Casablanca."
Groucho told Warner that his company would have to drop the word "Brothers" from its movies, because the Marx Brothers had owned that word for a much longer time than the Warner brothers.
Groucho recognized that the issue was ego, not income.
