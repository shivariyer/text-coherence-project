Your article on workers' compensation reform was comprehensive.
You state, however, that the $1 billion decline in workers' compensation premiums statewide was caused by large deductibles.
This is true only to a small degree, and the phenomenon ended when the current rate war broke out last summer and fall.
With upfront premium discounts of as much as 40%, most customers have jettisoned deductibles and nonsubscribers are re-entering the system.
Competition is not permitting insurance companies to recoup losses from prior years; there are too many hungry insurance companies willing to underwrite at current projected losses and costs.
Employers with 20 or more nonoffice-type workers with average records are seeing rates at least 20% below last year's -- and probably 40% below the rates in 1990.
This $1 billion saving is money coming right out of the pockets of the plaintiffs bar, and thereby out of the pockets of campaign funds of our legislature and judges.
Therefore, look for action in our next session of the Legislature to remedy the problem.
Their solution will not be good for Texas business, and it will not be good for the workers upon whom they depend for jobs.
