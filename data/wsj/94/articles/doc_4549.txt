Amoco Corp. said its production unit significantly improved its oil and gas reserve replacement performance last year.
The oil company, based in Chicago, said it replaced 89% of its oil and gas reserves during 1993, including the acquisition and sale of properties.
During 1992, it replaced only 31%.
The replacement number includes discoveries, additional delineation of existing fields, improved recovery techniques and upgrading estimates now considered conservative.
Excluding the U.S., Amoco replaced 150% of its oil and gas reserves, including purchases and sales of properties.
Amoco, which was a net seller of properties, focused the bulk of its sales on noncore Canadian assets.
Net proved reserves at the end of 1993 totaled 5.11 billion barrels of oil equivalent, down from 5.17 billion in 1992.
