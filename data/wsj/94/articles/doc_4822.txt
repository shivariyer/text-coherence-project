Sun Microsystems Inc. named J. Phillip Samper, Eastman Kodak Co.'s former vice chairman, as president of Sun Microsystems Computer Corp., its major operating unit.
As president, Mr. Samper, 59 years old, will head a computer workstation company that accounts for more than $4 billion of the corporation's $4.3 billion in annual revenue.
Mr. Samper succeeds Kevin Melia, who Sun said voluntarily stepped down from the post of acting president for family reasons.
Mr. Melia remains on Sun's internal executive board.
Sun said Mr. Samper will also resign as a member of its corporate board due to a company policy that allows only one inside director.
Mr. Samper, a 28-year Kodak veteran, left the Rochester, N.Y., company in 1990 after he was passed over for the chairman's job and started his own consulting company in Annapolis, Md.
He was named to Sun's board in 1991.
Last year, he was in the running to be Kodak's chairman and chief executive officer, but lost out again to Motorola Inc.'s chairman, George M.C. Fisher.
