Poplar Corp., a Canadian investment group, said it sold its 24% voting interest in Crownx Inc. for 36.7 million Canadian dollars (US$27.9 million), about two to three times what the group paid for the shares three years ago.
Poplar, which represents several Canadian insurance companies and other investors, said it sold its 2,825,000 Crownx common shares and 70,000 nonvoting Class A shares.
Stephen Johnson, a vice president at Koloshuk Farrugia, a securities dealer and part of the Poplar group, said the group had bought the Crownx common shares in two blocks, at C$4 a share and C$6 a share, about three years ago.
The shares were sold Friday for C$13 each.
Crownx's remaining controlling shareholders now have a combined voting stake in the company of 65.6%, up from 50.7% previously, he said.
Crownx, which has interests in life insurance and nursing homes, is controlled by the Burns family of Toronto and the Jodrey family of Nova Scotia.
