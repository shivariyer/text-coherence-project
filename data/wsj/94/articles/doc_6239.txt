Andrei Illarionov, the pro-reform economist who headed the Russian prime minister's Analysis and Planning Group, resigned, warning that the government's plans will lead the country to hyperinflation.
Indeed, announcement of his departure coincided with the release of data from the government's Center for Economic Analysis that said inflation in Russia jumped to 22% a month in January from 13% a month in December.
In his announcement to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Mr. Illarionov said, "The decisions now under preparation by your government will inevitably doom Russia to hyperinflation."
Mr. Illarionov joins the growing ranks of economists and reformers who have left the government since it was reorganized last month, bringing in advocates for industry and agriculture who called for moderation of the reform program.
In his eight months as Mr. Chernomyrdin's economic adviser, Mr. Illarionov often criticzed the government's programs.
Last week, he attacked a plan to support the farm sector with subsidies and privileges as "a sparkling text on lobbying" that would push up inflation.
January's inflation rate was the highest since October, when prices jumped at a 25% monthly rate.
Consumer-service prices jumped sharply last month, rising 70%, mainly because of higher train fares and telephone rates.
