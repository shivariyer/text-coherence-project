Any statistic on who the uninsured are in this country ("Ranks of Uninsured Climb," Dec. 15) fails to acknowledge another category of desperate Americans -- those who are "barely" insured and are close to becoming the permanently uninsured.
Has any number ever been placed on those who have little or minimal medical coverage yet are charged large premiums and even unimaginably larger deductibles?
My mother is caught in such a situation.
A self-employed seamstress, she often works 10 hours a day to support herself and my disabled father.
She is condemned to a life of "pre-existing condition" syndrome, an ailment that automatically denies her insurance coverage from any carrier other than the one she currently has.
Having had open-heart surgery six years ago prevents her from dropping a policy that is draining her and my father of their life savings and rapidly decreasing their quality of life.
Imagine paying premiums of $500 a month for a policy that has a $6,000 deductible, no coverage for prescriptions and no preventative care benefits.
All this and no guarantee that the company will not drop my mother if she ever again needs care.
My mother cannot afford to see a dentist, which she is in dire need of, and cannot get regular mammograms and other regular exams because she is scraping each month to pay her premium.
But the most humiliating injustice has been that my mother has ceased taking her heart medication because she can no longer afford it (more than $100 a month).
The situation is worse than statistics can ever prove.
Many more are suffering quietly and will probably never reap any benefits from reform that is much too overdue and still several years away.
