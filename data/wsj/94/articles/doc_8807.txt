General Public Utilities Corp. reported a 41% decline in fourth-quarter net income because of increased operating costs and write-downs related to its departure from a project in Pennsylvania.
The Parsippany, N.J., utility holding company had net income of $31.3 million, or 27 cents a share, down from $52.7 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier.

GPU took a $25 million write-down in the quarter stemming from its investment in Duquesne Light Co.'s Phillips Generating Station in western Pennsylvania.

For the year, GPU, which also owns Metropolitan Edison Co. and Pennsylvania Electric Co., reported net income of $295.7 million, or $2.65 a share, up 18% from $251.6 million, or $2.27 a share, a year earlier.
