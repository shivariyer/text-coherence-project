General Electric Co.'s GE Capital unit's $2.2 billion takeover bid for Kemper Corp. creates potential conflict-of-interest problems for KPMG Peat Marwick, which audits both companies.
But Peat says it thinks the problems can be resolved.
"Peat has to be very careful about the services it performs for both clients in this situation to avoid any independence or ethics conflicts," says Herbert Finkston, who heads the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' professional ethics division.
A big problem could arise if Peat performed any "due diligence" work for GE or Kemper, evaluating GE's bid or Kemper's assets, notes Mr. Finkston.
A spokeswoman for Peat says the accounting firm would have to ask both clients prior to performing such work.
"But we don't see any problem," she adds.
Thomas Sabol, general auditor for Kemper, says that only if Peat does consulting work involving the bid "could there be a conflict of interest."
Philip Ameen, GE's controller, says that GE has a lot of its own accountants doing such consulting work and probably wouldn't consult Peat.
Peat's biggest worries may come after GE's bid succeeds or fails.
Both companies are major Peat clients and the fees Peat receives would probably decline if the companies combined.
If the bid fails, Kemper may seek another auditor to preserve its confidentiality, accountants say.
GE is one of Peat's biggest clients with total annual fees in the $30 million to $40 million area.
