Spokesmen for two men indicted last week along with General Electric Co. and De Beers Centenary AG on charges of price-fixing said that both men denied any wrongdoing.
Previously, both GE and De Beers denied any wrongdoing.
A spokesman for Philippe Liotier, the deputy general manager of Cie. Financiere de Suez in Paris and until recently chief executive officer of Diamant Boart SA, said Mr. Liotier "committed no crime and thus has no comment to make."
Diamant Boart, based in Brussels, makes synthetic diamonds through a 50-50 joint venture with De Beers Centenary, which was cited in the criminal indictment for allegedly conspiring with GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., to fix prices of industrial diamonds.
The other man indicted is Peter Frenz, managing director of GE's Superabrasives unit based near Frankfurt.
"The charges are nonsense and the indictment is a bag of hot air," said Mr. Frenz's lawyer in Washington, D.C. GE Superabrasives, based in Worthington, Ohio, makes industrial diamonds.
