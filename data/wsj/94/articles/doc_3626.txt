Stock prices swooned as interest rates rocketed amid fears that inflation is creeping back.
After tumbling more than 45 points during the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered somewhat, ending the day 22.79 points lower at 3809.23.
It was the lowest close on the blue-chip stock index since Jan. 6.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.70 points to 464.44 and the Nasdaq Composite index gave up 3.86 points to 788.64.

"The liquidity tide has changed," said Wayne Nordberg, portfolio manager at Lord Abbett.
"Liquidity is running out of the financial markets and into the real economy and the market is being forced to recognize that."
News that the nation's gross domestic product soared at a 7.5% annual rate in the fourth quarter was expected to buoy stock prices yesterday but the prospect of any rally was quickly squashed by a report from the National Association of Purchasing Management.
Though the group's overall reading of manufacturing activity showed some slowing in the economy, its index that tracks prices soared, rising to the highest level since October 1990.
"When the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month, some people wondered `why is the Fed raising rates when there are no inflationary pressures in sight,'" said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at CS First Boston.
"Well, here's a bit of inflation."
For already edgy bond investors, it was more bad inflation news than they could swallow.
In a brutal sell-off, investors dumped bonds, driving the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond to 6.77% from 6.65% the previous day.
The Dow Jones Utility Average, considered by some a leading indicator of interest rates, also dropped, falling 1.05 to 209.40.
Mr. Applegate said it is still unclear whether companies will be able to pass some of the price increases they are seeing on the production side to consumers.
He said such concerns may have been behind yesterday's sharp sell-off in stocks.
"If you've got pricing power on the production side of the economy and not on the consumption side of the economy, you call into question the maintenance of margins, particularly with many consumer staples companies," said Mr. Applegate.
Meanwhile, in their rush to sell yesterday, investors ignored some encouraging news on the dividend front.
Standard & Poor's Corp. said there were 226 dividend increases last month, up from just 185 in January, and the highest one-month tally since 1981.
"The numbers have been coming in good for some time, but February was surprisingly high," said Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S&P's "Outlook" newsletter.
But Mr. Kaufman warned that improvement in dividends isn't necessarily a precursor to higher stock prices.
In fact, he said, some contrarians view a jump in dividend increases as a sign that stock prices may have reached a peak.
