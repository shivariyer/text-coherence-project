The Jan. 17 earthquake that rocked Los Angeles may have been bad news for residents, but it will provide a brief and much-needed economic boost, according to an influential California forecasting group.
The UCLA Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles says in a projection to be released today that the 6.7 magnitude shock "gets credit for a one-quarter jump-start to recovery."
Based in part on analysis of other natural disasters, including the effects in Florida of 1992's Hurricane Andrew, the UCLA group concludes that earthquake rebuilding will add 20,000 jobs to the California economy over the next year.
In effect, says Larry Kimbell, director of the forecasting project, losses in the temblor sparked a sudden burst of unanticipated demand, prompting not only repairs but a modest retail surge as household goods are replaced.
Other factors, including a stronger-than-expected national economy, also prompted the revised analysis that California is currently in a very slow recovery, one quarter sooner than expected, Mr. Kimbell said.
Overall, after briefly accelerating demand, "we expect that the . . . earthquake will have a very small but negative impact on the economy of Los Angeles," Mr. Kimbell says.
