It was amusing to read the Dec. 14 Legal Beat column, which reported that the California Supreme Court ruled (in a decision contrary to other courts) that law firms can include anticompetition clauses in their partnership agreements, and the California courts will enforce them.
The purpose of such clauses is to make it more difficult for departing lawyers to continue to represent clients after leaving the first law firm.
Rule 1-500 of the California Rules of Professional Conduct prohibits such anticompetitive agreements.
The commentary to this rule states explicitly that when a lawyer leaves the firm, whether the departure was "voluntary or involuntary," the lawyer must be "free to practice law without any contractual restriction except in the case of retirement from the active practice of law."
A lawyer who violates these rules can be disbarred.
By the way, do you know who promulgates these rules?
It is the California Supreme Court.
Now you know why I am amused.
