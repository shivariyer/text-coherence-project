Trans World Airlines launched a domestic fare promotion, offering discounts of up to 35% for travel through mid-May.
TWA, based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said the lower-priced tickets will be available for sale starting today and will be good through May 15 for travel in the continental U.S., Hawaii and San Juan.
In a separate, smaller promotion TWA is offering lower fares to Florida from New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C.
The round-trip Florida fares, $198 midweek and $258 on weekends, offer savings of up to nearly 45%, TWA said.
It isn't clear whether other airlines will follow the sale.
TWA's sale signals that the carrier, which emerged from bankruptcy-law protection in November, is making a bid for more business in the traditionally slack periods of winter and early spring.
