PS Group Inc., based in San Diego, reported a fourth-quarter loss of $14.6 million and said it sold its 85%-owned USTravel Systems Inc. subsidiary for about $40 million, after certain adjustments.
The travel-management concern, in a separate statement, said it was purchased by a closely held company owned by Dallas investor Murray Holland.
USTravel said its management won't be affected by the ownership change.
PS Group's shares rose 19%, or $2.125, to $13.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on the sale news.
PS Group, an aircraft leasing and holding company, said the fourth-quarter loss was equal to $2.41 a share.
The loss included a $10 million write-down on two freighter aircraft and a $4.2 million loss related to the travel operation.
In the year-earlier quarter, the company had a net loss of $56.1 million, or $9.29 a share, after several write-downs.
Proceeds from the USTravel sale were used to retire remaining bank debt of about $21.1 million and to meet certain other obligations.
PS Group said the sale will result in a first-quarter gain of about $15 million, or $2.47 a share.
