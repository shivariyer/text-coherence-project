North Texas sports retailers are bracing for the backlash of Cowboys fans angry over the departure of coach Jimmy Johnson.
The feud between Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Mr. Johnson, who announced yesterday he would no longer coach the Cowboys, has some owners of sports stores rethinking their fall orders for Cowboys merchandise.
"I'm getting on the phone right now to cut back my order 35% or 40%," says Ed Gamlin, owner of Sports Section Inc. in Dallas, who estimates 70% of his sports-apparel business is based on the Cowboys.
Mr. Gamlin says Mr. Johnson's loss could cost specialty sports shops $40,000 to $90,000 in sales.
"Dallas fans are very fickle," he says.
At Field of Dreams, a Dallas Galleria shop that sells footballs and helmets signed by the Cowboys for as much as $2,500, co-owner Jeff Phillips says fans already are grumbling when they see items signed by both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Jones.
"It may make some items more collectible," Mr. Phillips says.
"But long-term, it looks like they're going to kill the dynasty.
I know it's going to have a huge effect."
The dispute is particularly unsettling to Mr. Phillips, a Minneapolis native who picked the Dallas market and opened his store in November specifically to cash in on the Cowboys winning streak.
A happy Cowboys fan, says Mr. Phillips, "will buy our stuff before they pay their rent."
The enthusiasm of Cowboys fans prompted the North Texas Ford Dealers Association last year to sell a limited-edition pickup in Cowboys silver and blue.
Ford dealers say most of the trucks already have sold.
"Fortunately, I don't have very many left," says Charlie Nixon, sales manager for Prestige Ford in Garland.
Kerry Cassuto, owner of Big League Threads in Dallas, says he won't change his fall clothing orders, but may cancel some big-ticket Cowboys items.
"It's like Jerry Jones said at the beginning: There's no substitute for winning," Mr. Cassuto says.
"I think people are going to be really bitter."
