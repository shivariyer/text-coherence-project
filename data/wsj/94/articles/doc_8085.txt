In response to Michael K. Meyerhoff's Jan. 6 editorial-page piece "The Best Day Care?
A Parent at Home": It is exceedingly tiresome to hear, yet again, that I have, according to Mr. Meyerhoff, sacrificed the well-being of my children for merely an "opportunity for participation and recognition in the workplace."
This has to be a new low in working-woman-bashing.
For myself, and I dare to say the majority of other working women, building and maintaining a stable economic base for our families -- as single parents or as partners in a marriage -- is certainly more motivation than the types of recognition commonly available in the workplace (particularly considering that women get less monetary recognition than men).
I am also particularly offended by Mr. Meyerhoff's comment concerning "earning a few bucks to make ends meet."
The implication that a woman's desire for the modern equivalent of pin money could be satisfied by an increase in part-time work is patronizing beyond belief, as is the bone Mr. Meyerhoff throws concerning fathers' responsibility for raising children.
As to my wanting only to "sustain a lifestyle that their own parents only dreamed about a generation ago," Mr. Meyerhoff has, inadvertently I'm sure, hit the nail on the head.
I am a second-generation American, and it was exactly my grandparents' and parents' vision that through hard work, education and the American opportunity that their children could reap the rewards of their efforts for themselves and their children.
