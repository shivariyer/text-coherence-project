Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said 1993 net income climbed 70%, but that earnings from operations rose a more modest 37%.
Berkshire, the investment vehicle for financier Warren Buffett, reported net income of $688.1 million, or $595,000 a share, up from the prior year's $407.3 million, or $355,000 a share.
Per-share figures reflect an increase in the number of average shares outstanding to 1,156,243 in 1993 from 1,146,492 in 1992.
Mr. Buffett doesn't believe in stock splits; the increase mainly reflects the unusual issuance of shares to effect the acquisition last year of Dexter Shoe Co.
The earnings were disclosed after the market's close yesterday.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Berkshire Hathaway closed up $50, at $15,650.
The latest year's results included $356.7 million in realized investment gains; such gains can vary widely from period to period, and in 1992 totaled a much-smaller $59.6 million.
But the latest year's results were marred by a total of $146.3 million from the negative effect of an accounting change and what the company characterized as an unusual tax charge.
Excluding such items, earnings from operations in 1993 were $477.8 million, or $413,000 a share, up from $347.7 million, or $355,000 a share, in 1992.
Berkshire said it expects to release its annual report within two weeks, promising that that document, as it has in the past, "will include much additional information" regarding the company's operations.
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY Inc.'s 1993 per-share earnings were $595, compared with $355 a year earlier.
Operating earnings were $413 a share, up from $303 a share in 1992.
In an article yesterday, the figures were overstated.
