A new study suggests that coffee can induce osteoporosis in older women, but that a glass of milk a day will counter it.
The report, based on 980 women between 50 and 98 years old, found that lifetime consumption of caffeinated coffee was associated with decreased bone density, a key indicator of osteoporosis.
The disorder is a common cause of broken hips and other fractures among women past the age of menopause.
But researchers found no significant differences in bone density among participants in the study who drank at least a glass of milk a day over most of their adult lives, no matter what their coffee intake.
The study, by Elizabeth Barrett-Connor and colleagues at the University of California at San Diego, is published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
It was funded by the National Institute on Aging and the National Coffee Association.
The results are based on X-ray tests of the participants' hips and spines as well as a questionnaire administered between February 1988 and January 1992 that solicited a variety of data, including lifetime daily consumption of coffee and milk.
All of the women were white and from the upper-middle class community of Rancho Bernardo, Calif.
The findings don't prove that caffeinated coffee causes osteoporosis, but the researchers found a statistical association between the two after adjusting for such factors as age, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, use of estrogen-replacement therapy and the number of years that have passed since menopause.
Some previous studies have shown that caffeine has a negative effect on calcium in laboratory animals and people whose diets are low in calcium.
