Shiloh Industries Inc. is operating most of its plants at capacity because of booming demand for its steel products, but difficulty in passing through cost increases is pinching profit, said Robert L. Grissinger, president and chief operating officer.
Auto and truck manufacturers and their major suppliers are eager to get the steel shapes the company produces, but some are balking at paying higher prices, Mr. Grissinger said.
As a result, Shiloh has yet to pass through the full amount of last July's steel industry price increase, to say nothing of a smaller increase early this year, he said.
Meanwhile, the company is incurring overtime wage costs to meet the strong demand.
And a smaller Shiloh business that produces valve actuators is operating at a loss because of depressed demand from the oil industry, he said.
Mr. Grissinger said profit for the second quarter ending April 30 will be higher than the "disappointing" nine cents a share the company earned from operations in the first period, but won't equal the 32 cents earned in the 1993 second quarter.
Because of a public offering last July, the company has nearly 13 million shares outstanding, up from 9.2 million in the 1993 second quarter.
Strong order books signal excellent demand at least through the end of the 1994 auto-model year, he said.
And industry forecasts indicate strong sales through 1995.
Auto and truck parts consume 65% to 70% of the company's steel.
However, profits for the fiscal 1994 second half will depend heavily on the company's success in obtaining higher prices, Mr. Grissinger said.
Profit for the Oct. 31 fiscal year is "likely to be flat to down" from the $8.9 million, or 86 cents a share, earned in fiscal 1993, when revenue was $184.1 million.
Shiloh's primary business is stamping out steel blanks, flat steel shapes that customers form into parts ranging from truck wheels to auto mufflers.
