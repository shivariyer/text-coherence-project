The Securities and Exchange Commission is cool to a legislator's proposal that would allow multistate utility companies to enter the telecommunications business more easily.
"A broad exemption of telecommunications activities could severely limit the ability of the commission to protect the consumers and investors of registered holding companies," the SEC said in a letter to House members who are working on telecommunications legislation.
Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.) recently suggested that he would offer legislation giving utility companies a blanket exemption from SEC regulations that could prohibit their joining the telecommunications business.
Such a bill has yet to be offered.
The SEC must approve any diversification by public utility-holding companies that do business in more than one state.
Typically, the SEC has rejected diversification plans when a company can't show that a new business venture has a "functional relationship" to the company's core utility business.
Single-state utility companies are exempt from SEC oversight.
"Because of the `functional relationship' requirement, registered holding companies escaped the reversals suffered in the 1980s by exempt holding companies and free-standing utilities that had invested in real estate, drugstores, financial institutions and life insurance companies," the SEC said in its letter to Mr. Boucher and Democratic Reps. Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Philip Sharp of Indiana.
Mr. Markey is chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, and Mr. Sharp is chairman of the House Energy and Power Subcommittee.
