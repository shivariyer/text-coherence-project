American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it is forming a joint venture to make and sell telephones and telecommunications products in China.
AT&T said it will own 53% of the company and supply the technology and most of the component parts.
Its partners are the Post & Telecommunications Industrial Corp. of China, which will own 30% and distribute the products, and S. Megga Telecommunications Ltd. of Hong Kong, a manufacturer, which will own 17%.
The joint venture company, called AT&T Consumer Telecommunications Products (Beijing) Ltd., "puts the AT&T brand in a consumer market of over one billion people," said Bill Warwick, chairman and chief executive officer of AT&T China Inc.
The business unit was established last year after AT&T and the State Planning Commission of China signed a wide-ranging memorandum of understanding pledging to work together to enhance and modernize China's telecommunications infrastructure.
