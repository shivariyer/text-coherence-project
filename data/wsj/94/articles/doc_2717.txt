Sketchy 1993 earnings information from Germany's Hoechst AG and BASF AG chemical groups seems to confirm the picture of an industry on the verge of a cyclical upturn, analysts said.
While the numbers were overall slightly better than expected, BASF's fourth-quarter result stood out from the rest.
Extrapolating from the 1993 report, analysts estimate the group's pretax profit jumped to 451 million marks from 156 million marks ($262.1 million from $90.7 million) a year ago.
"That is a surprise," said Michael Stone, German chemicals analyst at S.G. Warburg in London.
"Unfortunately, we will have to wait and see why when they release more details."
Although both announced dividend cuts and lower pretax profits, that wasn't seen as a disappointment.
BASF said it would cut its 1993 dividend to eight marks a share from the previous 10 marks.
Its 1993 group pretax profit fell 15% to 1.06 billion marks, while group sales fell 3.3% to 40.6 billion marks.
Hoechst's 1993 dividend fell below BASF's as the group cut it to seven marks a share from the previous nine marks.
The group's 1993 pretax profit dropped 42% to 1.23 billion marks on a 0.4% rise in sales to 46.05 billion marks.
Analysts estimate Hoechst's fourth-quarter pretax profit fell to 303 million marks from 571 million marks a year ago.
BASF's group net profit rose just under 40% to 858 million marks, while Hoechst's fell 36% to 756 million marks.
In addition to the expected boost from rising U.S. demand, the German chemicals industry will likely be helped by a weakening of the mark against the dollar, which will make exports more attractive, said Matthias Welticke, analyst at Merck, Finck & Co. in Duesseldorf.
