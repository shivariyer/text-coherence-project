Fujitsu Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. said they are investing in the General Magic Inc. software consortium, becoming the latest high-technology heavyweights to join an amibitious effort to set communications standards for so-called intelligent networks.
The Japanese companies didn't specify terms or the size of their stakes, but Fujitsu, the world's second-largest computer maker, said an executive vice president, Mikio Ohtsuki, will join General Magic's board.
General Magic is made up of the world's two largest telecommunications concerns, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co., and the three biggest consumer-electronics companies, Sony Corp., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands, as well as Apple Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc.
The consortium, based in Mountain View, Calif., has developed a communications software called Telescript, that allows different kinds of computers to talk to each other, and to send out so-called programmable agents, basically electronic concierges, which gather and process information.
It has also created an operating system, called Magic Cap, that simplifies communication and facilitates the use of agents.
Toshiba said it will use both systems but didn't say how.
