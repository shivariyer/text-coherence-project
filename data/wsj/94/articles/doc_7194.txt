The Treasury said its net market borrowing needs in the first quarter are expected to be $45 billion, with a $20 billion cash balance on March 31.
The Treasury also estimated its net market borrowing needs for the second quarter to be in a range of $15 billion to $20 billion, with a $30 billion cash balance at the end of June.
A Treasury spokeswoman was unsure whether the funding estimates included expected spending for the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that deals with failed savings-and-loan institutions.
In the November announcement of its borrowing needs for the first quarter, the Treasury had estimated net market borrowing in the range of $60 billion to $65 billion, assuming a $35 billion cash balance on March 31.
Actual market borrowing in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, 1993, was $84.6 billion, with an end-of-quarter cash balance of $49.7 billion.
