The frigid cold has gotten the best of many Vanguard Group dividend checks.
Many of the tens of thousands of checks mailed on Jan. 3 have not reached their destination, and the Valley Forge, Pa., mutual fund group said poor weather conditions are to blame.
Icy roads and freezing temperatures caused problems in Vanguard's mailings to shareholders, said Brian Mattes, vice president, communications.
Federal Express deliveries and pickups were suspended for two days last week while roads were closed due to icing conditions.
"The mail is just creeping," Mr. Mattes said, "but many are starting to arrive."
Nearly one million copies of the Vanguard shareholder newsletter were mailed from Jan. 14 through Jan. 18.
Only a few shareholders have received their copies, he said.
Other big fund groups have been more fortunate.
Fidelity Investments, Boston, the nation's largest mutual fund company, has not experienced any delays in mailings to shareholders, said Neal Litvack, executive vice president at Fidelity.
Fidelity has a distribution center for its mailings in Dallas, so it avoided the frigid Northeast temperatures, he said.
