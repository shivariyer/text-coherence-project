Gold production at the Porgera mine in the Papua New Guinea highlands fell 13% to 290,675 ounces in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, from 335,283 ounces a year earlier.
The decline was expected and is a result of lower gold grades found at the open pit and underground operations.
The Porgera mine is owned equally by four partners: Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd., Placer Pacific Ltd., Highlands Gold Ltd., all based in Australia, and the Papua New Guinea government.
The partners said production for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, fell 22% to 1.16 million ounces of gold from 1.49 million ounces a year earlier.
The partners said expansion of the open pit mine and a higher volume of ore being processed at the Porgera mill is helping to partially offset the impact of lower gold grades.
Mining in the open pit averaged 59,800 metric tons a day and the partners said they have ordered more mining equipment to lift this rate to 100,000 tons a day by mid-1994.
Cash operating costs at the mine rose 54% in the second quarter to 246 Australian dollars (US$172.3) an ounce from A$160 an ounce a year earlier.
