Robert Bernard, president of Liz Claiborne Inc.'s international division, resigned to become president and chief operating officer of J. Crew Group Inc., a privately held apparel retailer.
Mr. Bernard, 43 years old, who has held various sales and marketing positions at Claiborne since 1985, said he will join New York-based J. Crew in about two weeks.
He said J. Crew, which has annual sales of more than $700 million, will give him a "fantastic opportunity, to work with a great retailer and manufacturer in our industry."
Mr. Bernard fills a position that had been vacant since July 1993, when Arnold Cohen left J. Crew to become chief executive at London Fog, an outerwear maker.
Mr. Bernard will report to Arthur Cinader, J. Crew's chairman and chief executive.
