HSBC Holdings PLC and its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank Ltd., both reported slightly better-than-expected earnings for 1993, but acknowledged that the good results stemmed largely from strong capital markets in the year, rather than from strong growth in their income from loans.
HSBC reported after-tax earnings of 1.8 billion ($2.68 billion), 48% over the 1992 figure -- equivalent to a 44% rise in Hong Kong dollar terms.
Analysts had expected an increase of roughly 37%.
HSBC's earnings-per-share rose a slower 16% to 72 pence -- reflecting the full calculation this year of shares issued during its 1992 buyout of Midland Bank PLC.
Hang Seng Bank's after-tax profits rose 18% to HK$6.2 billion (US$801.6 million), slightly outpacing analysts' expectations of a 17% increase.
Its earnings per share also rose by 17%.
Hang Seng Bank is 61.5%-owned by HSBC Holdings.
Both banks announced dividend increases of 24% a share.
HSBC also announced an "enhanced scrip dividend alternative," under which shareholders can receive a 5.3% larger dividend per share if they accept a portion of it in stock, rather than cash.
Both banks gave analysts the most comprehensive disclosure of their businesses ever.
Previously, the bank and most others in Hong Kong simply announced its consolidated earnings before and after taxes, without describing the profitability of its various operations.
