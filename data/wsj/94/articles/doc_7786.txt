Centex Corp. reported a 34% increase in fiscal third-quarter net income, citing markedly improved results in its home building, mortgage banking and construction products businesses.
The Dallas-based construction and banking concern said its net income for the period ended Dec. 31 rose to $23.6 million, or 72 cents a share, from $17.6 million, or 55 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue was up 28% to $833.3 million from $648.7 million.
The results were at the high end of estimates by industry analysts, who had projected net income of 64 cents to 73 cents a share for the period.
Amid an increase in home prices and lower lumber prices, Centex said that operating earnings from its home building unit rose 23% to $25.8 million from $21 million in the year-earlier period, on a 25% increase in revenue.
Compared with the year-earlier period, home sales were up about 14%.
The mortgage banking unit's operating earnings soared 58% to $20.7 million from $13.1 million a year earlier, on a 59% boost in revenue.
Looking ahead, Centex said that it expects home building margins to continue to improve during its fiscal fourth quarter.
The company also said it expects to offset expected declines in the rate of mortgage refinancings by increasing its number of mortgage banking offices.
