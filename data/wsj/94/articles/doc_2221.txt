German electronics group Siemens AG, Munich, announced it had received a contract from Russian natural gas producer Gazprom for a communications network worth 22 million marks ($13 million).
The contract includes a private communications system for 14,000 participants and a public telephone office for 4,000 participants, Siemens said in a statement, as well as a 155-megabit-per-second data communications system and a mobile paging system for 1,000 participants.
The networks will be installed in Gazprom's Moscow headquarters, which is spread over several city districts, and which will be linked by around 100 kilometers (62 miles) of glass-fiber cable, Siemens said.
