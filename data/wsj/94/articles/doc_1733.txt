Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., a footwear and apparel maker, said net income in its fiscal fourth quarter fell 81%, due largely to a one-time charge for early retirement of debt.
For the quarter ended Jan. 30, net was $1.8 million, or six cents a share, compared with $9.7 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.
The most recent quarter included a $11.4 million charge for the debt prepayment.
Sales were up 13% to $309.1 million.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Phillips-Van Heusen stock rose 75 cents to $37.875.
The company said although the winter storms will be a factor in the company's first quarter results, it is optimistic that the "continued expansion" of Bass Apparel and Geoffrey Beene for Women, combined with the introduction of a Bass Kids merchandise line will provide the basis for strong growth.
