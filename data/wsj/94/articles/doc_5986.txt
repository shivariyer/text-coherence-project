The special counsel investigating the Whitewater affair will look into a published report alleging that Hillary Rodham Clinton's former law firm shredded documents related to the matter.
The Rose Law Firm yesterday denied an account in the Washington Times quoting an unidentified employee of the Rose Law Firm as saying he had participated in destroying Whitewater documents last Thursday.
The Little Rock, Ark., law firm represented Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which is at the center of the Whitewater affair because its owner was a partner of the Clintons in the failed real estate development deal now under investigation by Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr.
Ronald M. Clark, the managing partner of the Rose Law Firm, said yesterday that "there has been no destruction of documents to my knowledge."
He said the law firm has been systematically "accumulating and then safe keeping" any documents related to Madison.
"To my knowledge," he added, the firm has "no substantial documents whatsoever with respect to Whitewater."
Mr. Clark also said that last month the Rose Law Firm retained Vinson & Elkins, a 530-lawyer Houston law firm to represent it in "anything and everything that arises out of this matter."
