Trans World Airlines, facing increased competition from rival carriers, said it will abandon plans to establish a hub in Atlanta while expanding service at its only remaining major base, in St. Louis.
The nation's seventh-largest airline said it plans to cut service from Atlanta by 80%, to 11 daily flights from the current 57 by June 1.
It will increase departures from St. Louis to 300 from the current 257.
A TWA spokesman said the airline would continue to serve New York's Kennedy International Airport and Washington National Airport from Atlanta.
The increased service from St. Louis would be fed by planes that now normally service Atlanta, as well as new planes the airline has acquired.
Separately, TWA said it would streamline its North Atlantic routes.
It suspended its service to Brussels, citing stiff competition and resulting low yields.
It also said it would begin daily service to Tel Aviv on April 3, and would start nonstop service to Cairo, Egypt, as early as May 1.
