Liberte Investors said it expects to transfer most of its assets on or about March 31 to a wholly owned subsidiary to be named Resurgence Properties Inc.
The company said it will distribute the common stock of Resurgence Properties to holders of Liberte's 10.5% subordinated notes due 1993, to fully satisfy obligations to those holders.
Liberte, a Dallas-based real-estate investment trust, said Resurgence Properties will assume Liberte's obligations under its senior secured debt on restructured terms at the time of the asset transfer.
Since last October, Liberte has operated under protection of Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
