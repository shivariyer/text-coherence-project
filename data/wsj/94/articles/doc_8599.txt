Incumbents are endlessly creative in trying to avoid the term-limit laws that pass everywhere they're on the ballot.
But savvy voters aren't letting them get away with it.
When Houston voters approved local term limits in 1991, City Council members created a loophole that allowed them to run again if they collected a certain number of voter signatures.
Citizen groups put a measure on last Saturday's ballot to close that escape hatch.
The City Council then put a competing proposal on the ballot to simply repeal the term-limit law.
The results were unambiguous: 73% of voters favored closing the term-limit loophole.
An even larger 79% majority opposed ending term limits.
It's becoming clear voters don't just favor limits on political tenure because they're mad at Congress.
They believe term limits are a necessary check on an entrenched political class at all levels of government.
