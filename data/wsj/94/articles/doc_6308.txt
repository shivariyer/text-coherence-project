Consumer complaints about airline service dropped 13% last year, even though flight delays increased slightly, the Transportation Department said.
Of the 5,985 complaints the Transportation Department received last year, the biggest cause was flights being delayed or canceled.
In addition, the number of complaints for lost or mishandled luggage dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 customers from 5.87 complaints in 1992.
As in 1992, Southwest Airlines had the least complaints per passenger among large airlines, followed by Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, while Trans World Airlines had the most.
Continental Airlines was the only airline whose complaint performance worsened; it had 608 complaints last year, compared with 455 the previous year.
Large airlines posted an on-time arrival rate of 81.6% in 1993, with Southwest posting the best rate, 89.7%, and Delta bringing up the rear at 76.7%, the Transportation Department said.
The on-time rates exclude delays caused by mechanical problems.
