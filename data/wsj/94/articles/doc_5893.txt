Mechanical Technology Inc. said it named R. Wayne Diesel president and chief executive officer, following the departure of Mark L. Hyland, 47 years old.
Mr. Hyland, named president and CEO about a year ago, left because of reasons "related to irreconcilable differences regarding certain management practices," the company said.
Mr. Diesel, 47, previously was president and chief financial officer of Lawrence Management Group Inc., the management-services unit of Lawrence Insurance Group Inc., which bought a 49% stake in Mechanical Technology in July 1992.
Mechanical Technology provides technology-development services and makes testing and measurement products for the defense and aerospace markets.
