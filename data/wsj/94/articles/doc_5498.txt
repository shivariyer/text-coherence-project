FORT WORTH, Texas-American Airlines will launch its first nonsmoking trans-Atlantic flight May 1.
Other U.S. carriers have recently announced smoking bans in first-class cabins on international flights, but American, a unit of AMR Corp., appears to be the first domestic carrier to banish cigarettes completely on an international flight.
The policy will take effect on American's New York-to-London service.
