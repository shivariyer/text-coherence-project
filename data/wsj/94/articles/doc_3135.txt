Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, Mich., said it plans to invest more than $200 million to boost capacity and modernize a plant that makes engines and fuel tanks here, creating about 100 jobs over the next five years.
Ford said planned outlays include $120 million to improve production of steel fuel tanks, $42 million to build a machining operation for engine blocks and cylinder heads and $40 million to retool for production of a next-generation four-cylinder engine.
The plant currently employs 1,360 hourly and salaried workers.
