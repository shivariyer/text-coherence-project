Canadian municipalities in November issued building permits valued at a seasonally adjusted 2.14 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.62 billion), a 6.6% increase from C$2.01 billion in October, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
The November increase followed three consecutive months of decline in the value of building authorizations.
