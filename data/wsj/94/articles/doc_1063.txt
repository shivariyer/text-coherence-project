All Nippon Airways, Japan's second-largest passenger airline, said it decided to sell six jumbo jets.
The 10 billion yen ($94.36 billion) in expected proceeds will be used partly to fund dividend payments, officials said.
ANA said it will sell the two Boeing 747s and the four Boeing 767s to aircraft-leasing companies.
Facing weak demand for international and domestic air traffic, the company this month revised downward its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31.
ANA's outlook calls for an unconsolidated pretax loss of three billion yen, the first red ink since 1972.
Despite a projected net loss of four billion yen, the company has said it will pay a full-year dividend of three yen a share through sales of assets and attempts to run down reserves.
The jumbo-jet sales are factored into the earnings revision, a company spokesman said.
