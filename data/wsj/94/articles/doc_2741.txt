Mesa Inc. said it plans to sell 20 million common shares and will also issue debt securities.
The total value of the offerings wasn't disclosed.
The natural-gas production company said it would register the stock offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 10 days, and that market conditions will determine when the debt securities will be issued.
Mesa said proceeds from the offerings will be used principally to repay debt, which totals $1.2 billion.
