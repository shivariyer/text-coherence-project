Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. launched Estrace 0.5, which it said is the lowest-dose oral estrogen product for the prevention of osteoporosis, the bone-thinning disease.
The U.S. market for estrogen-replacement therapy, used to treat menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis, is estimated at $900 million a year, according to Bristol-Myers.
The higher-dose Estrace products hold about 8% of the market, which is dominated by American Home Products Corp.'s Premarin, a Bristol-Myers spokesman said.
