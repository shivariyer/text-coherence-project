British merchant bank Kleinwort Benson PLC said pretax profit more than doubled in 1993, with gains across all of its trading divisions.
Pretax profit for 1993 rose to #111.7 million, ($164.8 million) or 63.2 pence a share, compared with #45.1 million, or 15.6 pence a share, a year earlier.
Kleinwort Benson stressed, however, that #9.2 million of its #111.7 million of pretax profit resulted from the sale of its Sharps Pixley unit to Deutsche Bank in September.
Excluding this, pretax profit for the year was #102.5 million.
Still, this is well above the 88 million analysts were expecting.
The full-year dividend of 18.5 pence, compared with 16 pence a year earlier, was also higher than forecasts, which had centered on a payout of around 18 pence a share.
The merchant bank said that "favorable market conditions" throughout the year led to a "satisfactory" performance at its equity and treasury operations, and that the contribution from its debt and equities financing and issue business increased "substantially."
Kleinwort Benson said that overall operating profit rose to #438.1 million from #323.4 million a year earlier with healthy rises in both fees and commission and dealing profits.
However, net interest income declined 17% to #61.3 million from #73.7 million a year earlier.
