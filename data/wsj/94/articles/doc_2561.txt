Mr. Wright, a health-care industry veteran, had been group vice president for Storz Instrument Co., a unit of American Cyanamid Co., where he was responsible for the surgical specialties division.
He succeeds John L. Ufheil, 60, who will also retire from Celgene's board June 1.
Sol J. Barer, Celgene's president, will assume the additional responsibilities of chief operating officer and was elected a Celgene director.
