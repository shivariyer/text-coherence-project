Rep. John Dingell asked the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Citibank and Bank of America broke any U.S. laws in their roles in a $1.4 billion securities scandal in India.
Mr. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asked for reports on the findings from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt.
The Michigan Democrat also asked whether the Fed and SEC currently receive "sufficient information on the foreign securities activities of U.S. banks and cooperation from foreign regulators to conduct adequate surveillance and enforcement."
Citibank and Bank of America were named last December in a report by an Indian parliamentary committee that investigated the 1992 scandal.
Officials with the banks' parent companies, Citicorp and BankAmerica Corp., have denied any wrongdoing.
The report alleged that Bank of America and Citibank, along with Standard Chartered Bank, a unit of Standard Chartered PLC, and ANZ Grindlays, a unit of ANZ Banking Group, were "deeply involved" in irregularities in securities transactions and that they all failed to follow procedures of internal control.
The scandal revolved around the diversion of bank funds into the stock market using forged or fictitious receipts for securities.
The injection of money set the market on an unprecedented bull run, before the market crashed when the scandal was exposed.
