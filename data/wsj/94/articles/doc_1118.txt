Credit Agricole of France and Lazard Freres investment banking group announced the creation of a joint derivatives subsidiary that will offer clients sophisticated financial services using a variety of risk-management and funding techniques.
In a communique, the two partners said the new company, Credit Agricole-Lazard Financial Products Ltd., will specialize in serving large international corporations and financial institutions.
Based in London, the joint venture will be 75%-owned by Caisse Nationale du Credit Agricole, the central holding company for the French cooperative-banking organization.
The remaining 25% will be shared out between the three Lazard houses of London, New York and Paris.
Membership of the new venture's board will be divided equally between representatives of the two partners.
Credit Agricole, one of Europe's largest banks, has launched a drive to develop its corporate-banking activities.
The partnership is designed to combine its financial strength with the ingenuity and access to major international clients of the Lazard group of banks.
"This agreement marks the willingness of the two organizations to capitalize fully on their complementary abilities," the two partners said in a statement, "in order to gain a significant position in the growing market of structured finance."
