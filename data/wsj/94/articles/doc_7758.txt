Rally's Hamburgers Inc., whose profit and stock price have been on a downward slide, said the company and some officers and directors were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by a group of shareholders.
The Louisville, Ky., hamburger chain said that "the plaintiffs purport to represent a class of Rally's shareholders who traded in Rally's common stock between July 1992 and September 1993."
The company said the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Louisville, claims Rally's and some officers and directors violated federal-securities laws during that period and seeks unspecified damages and attorney's fees.
Rally's said it denies the allegations and will defend the action.
