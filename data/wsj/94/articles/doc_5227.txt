Audi AG, the luxury-car division of Germany's Volkswagen AG, said it received VW's approval to make its planned compact model at a facility in Ingolstadt.
Ingolstadt had competed with one of VW's own plants in Brussels as well with the company's Spanish Seat SA and Czech Skoda AS units, Audi said.
The model, which will put a new low end on Audi's range of luxury cars, is to go into production in mid-1996.
