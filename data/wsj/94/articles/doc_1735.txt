The Senate passed legislation designed to spur lending that encourages community development.
The Senate adopted the bill on a voice vote, essentially backing a Clinton administration proposal to provide $382 million for special community-lending institutions over four years.
"It is aimed at revitalizing distressed communities by helping to enlarge and strengthen" the ability of banks, credit unions and other local lenders and to improve their access to capital, said Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the Banking Committee.
Earlier this year, the House passed similar legislation, endorsing what the president has made a centerpiece of his efforts to boost credit and financial services in poor urban and rural areas.
Before passing the bill, the Senate, in a series of voice votes, approved a range of other banking-related amendments.
One, offered by Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.), was fashioned to promote securitization of commercial real-estate loans.
It would clear away some existing state laws and Securities and Exchange Commission provisions that are seen as impediments to the secondary market for such loans.
But the effect is likely to be modest; "it doesn't open the floodgates," a Senate staffer said.
