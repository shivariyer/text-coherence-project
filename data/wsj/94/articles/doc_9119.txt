Union Bank of Switzerland, Zurich, announced over the weekend that it intends to acquire a small Swiss regional bank in a cash and stock transaction.
The board of the bank to be acquired, Solothurner Handelsbank, has approved the takeover offer.
Handelsbank has two billion Swiss francs ($1.35 billion) in assets, seven outlets and 146 employees.
The takeover marks the latest in a string of acquisitions and mergers of small Swiss banks, many of which have faced difficulties from the sluggish Swiss economy and real estate market.
Union Bank of Switzerland is the largest of Switzerland's Big Three commercial banks.
