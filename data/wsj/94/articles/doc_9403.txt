News Corp.'s computer on-line service said it plans to allow viewers of the Fox Inc. basic cable network to give the television programmers a piece of their mind.
The service, Delphi Internet Services Corp., said that executives of the new FX channel, starting Jan. 17, will be available for live on-line discussions with viewers on a regular basis.
Delphi is among the half-dozen largest on-line services permitting computer users to communicate through the Internet network and offering a variety of information services.
Media companies have been teaming up with computer on-line services to provide subscribers additional information while allowing them to give feedback to the media companies.
Nickelodeon, which introduced a similar on-line forum last March on CompuServe, an H&R Block Inc. unit, appears to have been the first network to formalize an on-line forum.
Since then, hundreds of magazines and newspapers, which publish electronic editions, have used on-line forums for market research.
Anne Sweeney, chairman and chief executive of FX, said the service is "giving people a voice in what they see on TV."
