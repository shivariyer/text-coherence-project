GE Capital Mortgage Insurance Corp. unveiled a mortgage-insurance product that enables low- and moderate-income borrowers to reduce their down payment for a conventional loan to 3%.
The Federal National Mortgage Association, the leading U.S. mortgage investor, agreed to buy 3%-down loans that meet product guidelines.
Prior to this program, conventional loans required a down payment of at least 5%.
By cutting that to 3%, GE Capital estimated that 750,000 additional borrowers will be able to qualify for conventional loans to purchase modestly priced homes.
Conventional loans are those that aren't backed by the government.
"In addition to the loans Fannie Mae purchases, we will also insure loans held in lenders' portfolios, and product delivered to state-housing finance agencies and other investors," Martin Heck, president of GE Capital Mortgage Insurance, said in a statement.
The program will include a counseling service designed to help delinquent borrowers take corrective steps.
GE Capital Mortgage Insurance Corp. in Raleigh, N.C., is a unit of GE Capital Mortgage Corp., a subsidiary of GE Capital, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric Co., a diversified company in Stamford, Conn.
