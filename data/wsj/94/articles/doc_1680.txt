Micron Technology Inc., benefiting from strong prices for memory chips, announced fiscal second-quarter earnings well above analysts' expectations.
The Boise, Idaho, chip maker said net income in the period ended March 3 soared to $86.5 million, or $2.09 a share, from $9 million, or 22 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Analysts had expected a range of $1.82 to $2 a share, the company said.
Sales rose to $390.4 million from $176.4 million.
Micron said the increase was mainly due to strong demand for its four-megabit DRAM chips, as well as increased manufacturing capacity.
The results were announced after the close of the market.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Micron shares fell 75 cents to $83.25.
