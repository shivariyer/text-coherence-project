The Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded smartly as bond prices stabilized, turning a morning rout into an afternoon rally.
After plunging more than 50 points shortly following the opening bell, the industrial average gained 22.51 points to 3831.74.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.37 to 464.81 and the Nasdaq Composite index slid 5.17 to 783.47.
Setting the stage for the market's recovery was a report that President Clinton isn't moving as quickly as some expected on renewing a tough trade measure against Japan.
"If Nafta and GATT were good for the stock market, then a trade war with Japan would be bad," said David Shulman, stock strategist at Salomon Brothers.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange swelled to 361,130,000 shares -- the heaviest day of trading since the industrial average dropped more than 96 points on Feb. 4 -- from 300,030,000 shares Tuesday.
Declining issues outpaced advancers, 1,404 to 788.
Stock prices plunged shortly after the opening bell as a sharp decline in the U.S. bond prices and a meltdown in overseas debt markets drove the industrial average more than 50 points lower.
The selling was so fierce that the New York Stock Exchange activated its 50-point "collar," which curtails index arbitrage, the most popular type of program trading, whenever the industrial average drops or rises by 50 points.
But by midday, as Mr. Clinton's comments filtered across the newswires, stock and bond prices started to stabilize.
Leading the rebound were some of the stock market's usual defensive plays like oil and utility shares.
Also strong were stocks of auto and semiconductor companies, which are locked in a fierce competitive battle with Japanese companies.
General Motors gained 2 3/8 to 60 1/2, Chrysler 1 to 57 3/8, Ford 1 5/8 to 63 7/8 and Motorola 2 5/8 to 106.
Despite the stunning rebound, many analysts were hesitant to declare the selling over.
"It's an impressive comeback," said Thomas McManus, a market analyst at Morgan Stanley.
"But I think it's a little early to call it the end of the correction."
Even the ever-ebullient Elaine Garzarelli was sounding a little more cautious yesterday.
While the Lehman Brothers stock strategist still thinks the bull market in stocks is intact, she was advising clients yesterday to unload some stocks during the next rally, fearing that the subsequent surge in stock prices will be followed by a sharper market correction that will take prices 10% to 15% lower.
"I didn't expect interest rates to rise this fast," she said.
"But I am telling clients to lighten up a bit if the market rallies and the three-month Treasury bill rate remains high."
Single-country funds that trade publicly took a wild ride yesterday, reeling from the swings in the U.S. and foreign stock markets.
Mexico Fund chalked up a gain of 5/8 to 34 1/4 after trading as low as 31 3/4 yesterday; Chile Fund fell to 43 1/4 but finished the day up 1 to 47 1/2; Asia Pacific Fund, which invests in several Pacific Rim countries, lost 3/4 to 19 5/8 after dropping as low as 18 5/8; and Spain Fund eased 1/4 to 10 after falling as low as 9 3/8.
Rumors that Bankers Trust had incurred heavy trading losses in recent weeks sent the commercial bank's stock into a tailspin and created such a wave of sell orders on the New York Stock Exchange that the stock's opening was delayed.
Bankers Trust tumbled 2 1/4 to 78 1/2 on nearly five times its average daily volume, despite claims by the bank that it has been profitable so far this year.
J.P. Morgan, another big bank that depends heavily on trading profits, slid 1 1/4 to 66 1/4.
The weakness spilled over into other banking issues.
Citicorp dropped 3/4 to 39 5/8 and NationsBank was off 7/8 to 47 7/8.
Brokerage stocks also came under pressure.
Bear Stearns eased 3/8 to 21 1/4, PaineWebber 1/2 to 26 1/8 and Salomon Brothers 1/4 to 49 1/8.
Big gainers included: Aluminum Co. of America, which jumped 2 to 76 1/2; Caterpillar, which rose 3 1/8 to 112; and Eastman Kodak, which climbed 1 1/4 to 44 1/4.
AST Research skidded 5 1/4, or 18.3%, to 23 1/2 on Nasdaq after the Irvine, Calif., personal computer maker confirmed speculation that its earnings for the third quarter, which ends this month, will be depressed by weaker-than-expected sales.
Analysts at some brokerage firms removed the stock from their "buy" lists.
AST dropped 2 3/4 Tuesday.
Shares of other personal computer makers also slumped, in reaction to the AST news.
Compaq Computer dropped 2 1/4 to 94 3/8, while on Nasdaq, Apple Computer eased 5/8 to 35 5/8 and Gateway 2000 slipped 1/4 to 23 1/4.
Dell Computer was unchanged at 24 7/8.
Paramount Communications ended at 46 1/2 on its first day of trading on a "when distributed" basis.
The first step of Viacom's $10 billion purchase of the New York media company -- a $107-a-share tender offer -- closed Tuesday.
The when-distributed shares represent the value of securities that will be issued in the second half of the transaction.
Paramount's old common tumbled 27 3/4 to 48 1/4.
Holders of those shares are no longer entitled to the cash portion of the transaction, analysts said.
Most investors, though, tendered before the deadline.
Viacom's Class B shares dropped 3/4 to 28 on the American Stock Exchange.
CML Group lost 1 to 20 even though the Acton, Mass., company, which makes NordicTrack exercise equipment, reported slightly higher-than-expected earnings.
It had a profit of 74 cents a share in the second quarter ended Jan. 29, compared with 63 cents a share a year earlier.
The mean forecast of analysts surveyed by Institutional Brokers Estimate System put the latest quarter's profit at 73 cents a share.
