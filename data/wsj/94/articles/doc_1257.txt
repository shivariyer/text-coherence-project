Willcox & Gibbs Inc. said John K. Ziegler, 57 years old, resigned as chairman, president, chief executive officer and as a director, to pursue unspecified personal interests.
Named president and chief executive officer of the electrical-parts distributor was board member Alain Viry, 45, a former executive vice president of Rexel SA, which recently increased its stake in Willcox to 40%, from 30%.
Mr. Viry issued a statement praising Mr. Ziegler.
Board member Serge Weinberg, who is chairman and chief executive officer of Rexel, was named to a new position of Willcox vice chairman.
Eric Lomas, 47, also a board member, who is president of Hill Thompson Group Ltd., a New York investment-banking and securities firm, was named chairman.
Mr. Ziegler, who was said to be traveling, couldn't be reached for comment.
In a statement released by the company, he said Willcox had largely completed a restructuring program, giving him the opportunity to pursue personal interests.
Mr. Ziegler has been with the company for more than 27 years, including the last 18 as chief executive officer.
The restructuring included the company's acquisition late last year of Summers Group Inc., an electrical distributor based in Dallas, as well as Willcox's sale of additional shares to Rexel in February, said a spokeswoman for the company.
