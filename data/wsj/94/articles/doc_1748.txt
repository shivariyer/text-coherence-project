Kitrina Winther (Letters, Feb. 14) perpetuates some dangerous myths about abortion.
The fundamental myth is her view that "The question of when life begins is a personal and often religious belief."
Medical technology has confirmed uniformly and unanimously what the American Medical Association knew in 1871 (Transactions of the AMA, vol 22. (1871) p. 258): life begins at conception.
They who assert otherwise are the ones imposing religious views; no amount of evidence will change their minds.
The second myth is that "{t}he abortion decision . . . comes only after long hours. . . ."
Former abortuary operators admit that abortion is a pressure product sold to a woman in a crisis situation.
All too often the abortion is sold at the same time that the pregnancy test comes back positive.
The woman is not told the truth about her baby, barely told anything about the serious potential consequences to her, and rarely told about alternatives such as The Nurturing Network.
The purpose of the right-to-lifers outside the abortuary is then obvious: correct these inequities.
Let the woman know there are people who genuinely care, who are willing to help her (even to face a father whom the operator wants the woman to believe would do something very unpleasant to her).
The abortuary trespass is nothing more than a different use of the '60s "sit-in," of Rosa Parks sitting in the "wrong" section of the bus, of blacks sitting "illegally" at a lunch counter in North Carolina.
Just sitting, not doing.
Peaceful, not violent.
Illegal, but nothing close to the hysterical rantings of pro-abortion zealots.
And that is why various other protest groups -- even those despising right-to-lifers -- sided with the right-to-lifers in the RICO case.
One does not have to like the protest, but one has no right to overreact against the protesters.
