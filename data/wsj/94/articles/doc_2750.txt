Hypersensitive bond traders pushed bond prices higher early in the day when they misinterpreted remarks by Federal Reserve Gov. Lawrence Lindsey in a speech Monday night.
In an offhand vein, Mr. Lindsey commented that short-term interest rates will be "three-something" percent this year.
That was enough to allay temporarily bond traders' fears of further rate boosts.
Bond prices climbed until an aide for Mr. Lindsey clarified the matter.
"The aide said Lindsey threw it out as a humorous remark," said Ed Nicoski, chief market strategist at Piper Jaffray.
"That caused the bond market to sell off."
Stock prices were mostly higher early in the session, but lost their gains as bond prices faltered.
