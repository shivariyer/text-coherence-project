Bouygues SA, a leading European public works and construction concern, said in Paris that losses incurred by its property division helped to push its consolidated net profit down 34% in 1993 to about 450 million francs ($75.9 million).
The estimated figure is much lower than had been expected by equity analysts, who had been projecting a figure closer to 560 million francs.
Apart from the weakness of its property division, which is estimated to have incurred a loss of about 150 million francs last year compared with a profit of 91 million francs in 1992, the group's other businesses performed well in a difficult environment, increasing their shares of important markets.
