BlackRock Financial Management said it is cutting dividends on all of its 11 closed-end taxable bond funds.
The cuts take effect with March 31 dividends.
All of the funds invest in mortgage-backed securities, which were hurt by declining interest rates in the past 18 months.
Lower rates caused a rush by homeowners to refinance the mortgages that back the funds' portfolios, which in turn reduced the funds' interest income and led to the dividend cuts, BlackRock Financial said in a statement.
"Because interest rates are significantly lower today than they were even a year ago, the reinvestment interest rate of the funds has declined," BlackRock said.
If they didn't cut dividends, the funds would be forced to dip into their capital to make payments to shareholders, said Clay Lebhar, a managing director at Prudential Securities, which underwrote many of the funds' initial public offerings.
One fund, Blackrock Income Trust Inc., is cutting its dividend to 6.25 cents a share from 7.08 cents.
Its stock on the New York Stock Exchange dropped to $8.125 a share in composite trading Friday, down 25 cents .
Another fund, Blackrock Advantage Term Trust Inc., is cutting its dividend to 6.042 cents a share from 6.875 cents.
Its shares closed at $9.625, down 12.5 cents in composite trading .
The "term" nature of some of the funds contributed to BlackRock's decision to reduce their dividends.
These funds mature at a certain date in the future, at which time they try to have a target value per share.
To help insulate the funds from losses as they approach maturity, they tend to buy bonds with shorter and shorter maturities over time.
Because short-term interest rates are so low, that has also squeezed the funds' interest income.
