Two banking groups urged the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury to resolve their differences over reshaping the bank-regulatory system before Congress takes up the matter.
The groups also threatened to oppose all legislative efforts that the agencies couldn't agree on.
"We are in agreement with the intent of the proposals put forward by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board, both of which are designed to eliminate duplicative and unnecessary regulation," top officials of the American Bankers Association and the Bankers Roundtable wrote in a Feb. 10 letter to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.
But "We cannot support or recommend either proposal" because the plans don't meet certain criteria the groups say are most important."
The groups said any reform plan should preserve separate regulatory structures for state- and nationally-chartered banks; maintain an important supervisory and regulatory role for the Fed; save costs and reduce duplication; reduce the number of bank agencies; and fold in credit-union supervision.
