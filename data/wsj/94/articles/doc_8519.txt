Tandem Computers Inc., benefiting from cost-cutting, surprised analysts with better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter net income on a slight decrease in revenue.
For the period ended Dec. 31, the mainframe-computer maker earned $24.9 million, or 22 cents a share, after a onetime gain of $23 million, or 20 cents a share, from the previously reported sale of its Applied Communications Inc. software unit.
Tandem's profit was 42% above the year-earlier quarter, when it posted net of $17.5 million, or 16 cents a share, after a gain of $12.4 million, or 11 cents a share, from an accounting change.
Operating profit was two cents a share, well above the six-cent loss that analysts had expected.
Tandem's shares jumped on the news, gaining $1.625, or 13%, to $13.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Revenue for the recent period slipped 1.7% to $475.6 million from $483.8 million.
Analysts had expected a larger decline, but Tandem surprised them by selling more of its newly introduced Himalaya computers.
The improved performance comes after disappointing fiscal third and fourth quarters, where Tandem blamed weak results on a poor economy and fierce price competition, as more of its customers moved away from Tandem's expensive mainframe computers to smaller, less-expensive computers.
In a news release, Tandem's president and chief executive, James G. Treybig, said that "we are pleased with our ability to generate profit in a historically weak quarter."
He noted that Tandem "is seeing a resurgence" in its major customer base, the financial-services market, where demand has been weak in recent years.
