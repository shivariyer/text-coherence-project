GTE Corp., Stamford, Conn., reported a fourth-quarter loss of $466 million, largely due to a previously announced $1.2 billion charge to restructure and slash 13% of its work force.
The loss per share was 50 cents and compares with net income of $417 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier.
The 1993 quarter also included a gain of $91 million, or 10 cents a share, from the sale of telephone properties.
Revenue for the quarter slipped 1.4% to $5.06 billion from $5.13 billion, as GTE's phone business cut rates amid price wars and federal purchases of mobile communication equipment declined.
For the full year, GTE posted net income of $900 million, or 93 cents a share, compared with a 1992 loss of $754 million, or 86 cents a share.
