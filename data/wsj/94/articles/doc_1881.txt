Tenneco Inc. said a unit formed a joint venture to open a folding carton plant in Bucharest.
Tenneco said the venture, named PCA Romania SRL, was formed by its Packaging Corp. of America and Kraftcorr Inc., a closely held international marketer of kraft linerboard based in Garden City, N.Y.
The venture's plant will produce folding cartons and laminated cartons for the Romanian domestic market and other central European countries.
Tenneco said another of the unit's joint ventures, PCA Budafok in Budapest, will supply paperboard to the new plant, which it expects will start up within 30 days and be at full production by the end of the second quarter.
In addition to packaging, Tenneco has interests in farm and construction equipment, natural-gas pipelines, shipbuilding, automotive products and chemicals.
