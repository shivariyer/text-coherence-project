New Jersey casino owner Donald Trump said he has changed his mind about expanding into Las Vegas by acquiring the Aladdin Hotel & Casino.
Mr. Trump, who was said less than two weeks ago to be near an agreement to buy the casino for $60 million, said yesterday he was willing to pay only $51 million for the Aladdin.
His decision to withdraw from negotiations for the Aladdin comes after a number of other bidders emerged for the 1,000-room hotel and casino.
Last week, the casino's owner, Bell Atlantic Tricon Leasing Corp., a unit of Bell Atlantic Corp., said it will hold a sealed bid auction on the property.
