EDO Corp. reported a fourth-quarter loss, job cutbacks and lower sales due to cuts in military spending.
The designer and maker of advanced electronic and specialized equipment, based in College Point, N.Y., posted a net loss of $6.2 million, or $1.19 a share, compared with earnings of $1.5 million, or 21 cents a share, the year before.
Sales sank 12% to $27.5 million.
The 1993 quarter included a $9.8 million charge for a restructuring plan "to address the continuing world-wide decline of the defense and aerospace business and improve the company's competitiveness."
The plan includes the discontinuance of the company's defense business in Canada, the relocation of some U.S. production and the related disposition of nonproductive assets and work-force reductions.
The company said it expects to whittle its work force of 1,000 by eliminating 100 jobs this year through attrition, retirement or layoffs.
