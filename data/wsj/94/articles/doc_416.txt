The Resolution Trust Corp. will reopen many investigations into possible thrift-related violations, the RTC's general counsel said in an internal memorandum.
Ellen Kulka, who recently became general counsel for the savings-and-loan cleanup agency, sent the memo to top RTC legal-field people and staff attorneys concerned with enforcement.
The memo described a more streamlined legal structure, in accord with "management reforms" that were mandated in legislation enacted last December.
The reopened investigations result from recent legislation that extended the statute of limitations for legal actions involving many thrift-related violations.
Ms. Kulka's memo said that "investigations of possible intentional wrongdoing" will mean "concerted effort" by legal and investigative personnel.
The new investigations will probably involve several hundred cases that were previously closed, an RTC spokesman said.
He said the inquiries might uncover new evidence, but didn't promise any "dramatic results."
In December, Congress extended the RTC's statute of limitations to five years from three years for a variety of civil lawsuits.
In February, the statute of limitations was extended to the end of 1995 for many S&L officers, directors, lawyers and accountants for which the five-year time limit was to expire Feb. 28.
Last month's action was taken in response to Sen. Howard Metzenbaum's (D., Ohio) urgings for the RTC to continue investigating S&Ls in general and to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's (R., N.Y.) urging for the RTC to continue probing any wrongdoing tied to Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan.
Madison Guaranty was the thrift involved in the controversy surrounding the Clintons' Whitewater Development Co. investment in Arkansas.
