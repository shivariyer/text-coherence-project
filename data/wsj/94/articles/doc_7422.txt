Infomercial marketer National Media Corp. said its board unanimously rejected an unsolicited $117.5 million takeover bid by ValueVision International Inc., a Minneapolis home-shopping network.
In a statement, Philadelphia-based National Media said its board, advised by UBS Securities Inc., considered the $10-per-share bid "financially inadequate."
It said it will "develop a plan to maximize shareholder value" that could include the sale of company assets or businesses or the sale of the company as a whole.
A spokesman for ValueVision said the company had no response.
National Media stock closed at $11.125, up 12.5 cents, in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.
ValueVision closed at $12.25, down $1.375 cents, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
