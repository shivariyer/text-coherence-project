Marietta Corp.'s former chief executive pleaded not guilty to securities-fraud violations.
John Nadolski was released on his own recognizance after a brief appearance before U.S. District Judge Thomas McAvoy.
Mr. Nadolski was indicted last month by a federal-court grand jury in Syracuse, N.Y., for allegedly conspiring with former Marietta Vice President Thomas J. Blair to falsify documents to bolster his company's financial image with investors.
Marietta, based in Cortland, N.Y., designs and markets guest-amenity programs to the travel and lodging industry.
Mr. Blair resigned in 1991 after he was accused of embezzling $400,000.
He pleaded guilty to federal theft and conspiracy charges last year and cooperated with the government in its investigation.
Mr. Nadolski was charged with six counts of securities fraud.
He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine, if convicted.
He is on an unpaid leave of absence as company president from Marietta.
