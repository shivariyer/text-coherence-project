American Greetings Corp., Cleveland, said it would launch a significant "multimillion dollar" campaign to promote its CreataCard sales to consumers in the U.S. and Canada.
The advertising campaign will use national and local television commercials as well as radio broadcasts in 60 markets to promote CreataCard, a system designed to allow consumers to create, personalize and manufacture their own greeting cards within about 2 1/2 minutes.
The commercials will air on network television and cable stations including Lifetime, USA and Nickelodeon, the company said.
American Greetings operates about 8,000 CreataCard kiosks in drugstores, supermarkets, card and specialty shops and mass retail outlets across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Puerto Rico.
Expected annual revenue for CreataCard for the fiscal year ended Feb. 28, 1994, is about $35 million, the company said.
CreataCard is a subsidiary of American Greetings, a manufacturer and distributor of greeting cards.
