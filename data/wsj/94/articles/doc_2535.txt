Dayton Hudson Corp. said fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose 12%, reflecting better performances in its discount and upscale department store chains and an internal accounting change.
For the quarter ended Jan. 29, the Minneapolis retailer reported net income of $278 million, or $3.81 a share, compared with $249 million, or $3.39 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 6% to $6.28 billion.
The earnings benefited from a change the company made in its LIFO inventory accounting practices.
The change resulted in a $107 million LIFO inventory credit in the fourth quarter.
Under a different LIFO system a year ago, Dayton Hudson recorded a $22 million fourth quarter LIFO credit.
The company declined to disclose what this year's credit would have been without the accounting change.
For the year, net fell 2% to $375 million, or $4.99 a share, from $383 million, or $5.02 a share.
Revenue rose 7% to $19.23 billion.
Dayton Hudson said operating profits in its Target discount stores and its upscale department store division increased for the full year by 15% and 18%, respectively.
But operating earnings at its troubled Mervyn's stores declined 37%.
