The company, Complejo Siderurgico de Guayana CA, was formed to design, construct and operate a plant for processing iron oxides into hot briquetted iron, an enhanced form of directed reduced iron.
The plant, to be constructed this year with operation scheduled for late 1996, will have capacity of one million metric tons per year.
In addition to its equity investment, the Portland-based steelmaker will annually receive 200,000 metric tons of the iron from the venture.
Other major investors are Kobe Steel Ltd. of Japan and Ferrominera del Orinoco, a subsidiary of the Venezuela government-owned holding company responsible for developing industry in Venezuela.
Investors in the project will put up a total of $250 million.
