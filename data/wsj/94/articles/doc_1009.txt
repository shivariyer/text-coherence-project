Anheuser-Busch Cos., expanding an already aggressive share-repurchase plan, disclosed that it intends to buy back 25 million shares, or about 9%, of its common stock outstanding.
The St. Louis brewing giant noted that a June 1992 authorization to repurchase 20 million shares is about 85% complete.
Yesterday, Anheuser-Busch shares rose $1.50, or 2.9%, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, to close at $53.25; at that price, the latest repurchase program would cost the company an indicated $1.33 billion.
Anheuser-Busch said it has no timetable for completing the repurchase program, which will involve purchases in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.
