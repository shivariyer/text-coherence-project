Avon Products Inc. posted a 2% rise in fourth-quarter profit, with gains in international operations compensating for a large profit drop in its U.S. unit.
The beauty products concern had net of $105.4 million, or $1.46 a share, compared with $103.3 million, or $1.43 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 7% to $1.26 billion.
As expected, New York-based Avon also said its board authorized the purchase of up to 10% of the company's common stock, or seven million shares.
Avon attributed the sales and profit gains to its international unit, as well as to lower foreign exchange losses.
Its U.S. business continued to show weakness.
"U.S. results were obviously disappointing but showed an improving trend late in the quarter and sales momentum has accelerated significantly going into 1994," said Chairman James E. Preston.
"Improving sales, combined with our plans to reduce expenses from the unusually high 1993 levels, gives us confidence that a strong recovery in the profitability in the U.S. is underway," he said.
Avon closed at $55.875, up $2.875, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
