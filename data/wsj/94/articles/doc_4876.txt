The Federal Trade Commission said a proposed program for peer review of physician fees wouldn't violate federal antitrust laws and could help consumers.
In a letter to the American Medical Association and the Chicago Medical Society, which jointly proposed the program, the FTC said "advisory peer review can give patients, and payers such as health-insurance companies, information about the basis for a fee and an informed opinion about its reasonableness, and help them decide whether to pay a disputed bill or to continue to patronize a particular doctor."
The agency said it has recognized the benefits of peer-review programs in the past.
This program was unique in that physicians would have to participate in the plan in order to obtain membership in the Chicago Medical Society, physicians could be disciplined for certain fee practices, and the society could publicize the names of physicians it had disciplined.
The two medical groups sought an advisory opinion from the FTC on the legality of the program, which would operate through two committees.
The patient grievance panel would issue nonbinding opinions on patient complaints about a doctor's behavior or fees.
The professional disciplinary committee could punish physician behavior related to fraud and other misconduct.
The FTC added, however, that disciplinary action based solely "on the basis of fee levels where there has been no fraud or other abuse could violate the antitrust laws and injure consumers."
