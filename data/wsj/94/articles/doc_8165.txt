Hewlett-Packard Co. and Pacific Telesis Group said they would jointly build an interactive video system that will enable consumers in certain California markets to order movies and other programs by early next year.
Under an agreement, Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., will provide large video servers to warehouse data and transmit it to homes, while Pacific Telesis Video Services, a unit of San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, will offer its "on-demand" services to customers in San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley.
Initially, subscribers will be able to choose from a list of hit movies, TV programs and special events.
Using a simple remote-control device, customers will be able to stop, rewind or fast-forward a program just as they do with a videocassette recorder.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
