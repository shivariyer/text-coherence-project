The Chicago Board of Trade will announce today that it hopes to join forces with Bloomberg Financial Products to develop an electronic trading system for cash government securities.
The Board of Trade now offers investors hugely popular futures and options contracts based on U.S. Treasury bonds, notes and bills, and it also wants to trade the securities themselves.
Under the proposal, firms that own memberships at the CBOT would be able to trade government securities by punching orders into electronic computer terminals.
Bloomberg, which is best known for its Bloomberg financial news service, would handle the technical end of the project, people familiar with the proposal said.
The CBOT will unveil its plan at a news conference today.
The people said it will resemble Electronic Joint Venture, or EJV, a similar but ill-fated CBOT proposal that died when the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to give the system its blessing.
To make the new proposal a reality, the big Chicago exchange and Bloomberg will need approval from the SEC.
