Annual paychecks approaching $10 million are becoming commonplace in Wall Street's executive suites these days.
PaineWebber Group Inc. said Donald B. Marron, its chairman and chief executive, received a 1993 pay package currently valued at $9.4 million amid record profit at the big brokerage firm.
In a proxy statement, PaineWebber said it paid Mr. Marron a cash bonus of $6.3 million, 58% higher than his 1992 bonus.
Mr. Marron's pay package also included salary of $600,000, restricted stock valued at $1.19 million, options on PaineWebber shares valued at $789,241, and "other" compensation of $534,432, the proxy said.
Mr. Marron also received $2.7 million in 1993 for exercising options on 139,218 PaineWebber shares, the proxy said.
As of Dec. 31, l993, Mr. Marron held $7.3 million in exercisable options on PaineWebber stock.
Earlier this week, Merrill Lynch & Co. said Daniel P. Tully, its chairman and chief executive, received a 1993 pay package currently valued at about $9.9 million.
Merrill also paid three other top executives more than $6 million apiece amid record 1993 profit.
Mr. Marron's hefty 1993 cash bonus and restricted stock award -- up 24% from 1992 -- stemmed from PaineWebber's "exceptional financial performance for 1993 and its strategic progress since 1987," the proxy said.
The restricted stock and options payouts "reflect the compensation committee's policy of tying a substantial portion of Mr. Marron's compensation to the future performance" of PaineWebber stock.
Amid the boom in trading and underwriting stocks and bonds, PaineWebber had record 1993 net income of $246.2 million, up 15% from 1992.
The paychecks at PaineWebber and Merrill portend a banner pay year for Wall Street executives, who are basking in their third consecutive year of blockbuster profits.
PaineWebber, the nation's fifth-largest brokerage firm, also gave Paul B. Guenther, its president, a 1993 pay package currently valued at about $5.7 million, the proxy said.
This includes a $3.8 million bonus -- 58% higher than 1992 -- as well as $716,649 in restricted stock, options on PaineWebber stock valued at $473,544, and $307,824 in "other" compensation.
Mr. Guenther's base salary is $400,000.
Joseph J. Grano Jr., PaineWebber's brokerage chief, received a pay package valued at about $5.6 million, the proxy said.
Lee Fensterstock, an executive vice president and head of institutional sales and trading, received 1993 pay currently valued at $4.3 million.
