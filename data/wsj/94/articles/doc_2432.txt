DuPont Co., Wilmington, Del., said it is considering a joint venture to make Lycra spandex in China.
The chemicals giant said it agreed with China Worldbest Development Corp. to explore such a venture, and the companies are "proceeding to assess opportunities and obtain relevant approvals."
Expanding into China -- one of the largest textile markets -- is a "logical extension" of its strategy of ensuring Lycra has a "world-scale manufacturing presence in all growth areas," DuPont said.
China Worldbest is majority owned by the China National Textile Council, a government group for furthering textile-industry development in the country.
DuPont has two facilities in China, one that processes certain film materials, and a joint venture that produces a rice herbicide.
In mid-December, it disclosed plans to form a Chinese joint venture to make electronic materials for microcircuits.
