Smith Corona Corp. said earnings declined 63% in the fiscal second quarter to $1.5 million, or five cents a share, from $4 million, or 13 cents a share.
Revenue in the quarter, which ended Dec. 31, rose 8%, the company said.
The company's stock price tumbled 62.5 cents, or 9.6%, to close at $5.875 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
Smith Corona, the New Canaan, Conn., manufacturer of typewriters and personal word processors, said increased pressure on wholesale selling prices and unfavorable foreign currency exchange contributed to the decline in profit, even though sales and unit shipments were up from the previous year.
Sales were $93.6 million, compared with $86.7 million a year earlier.
The company said it will relocate its manufacturing operations from Cortland, N.Y., to Mexico by the end of March, but it doesn't expect to realize cost savings during this fiscal year ending in June.
