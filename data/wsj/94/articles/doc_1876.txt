Tarmac PLC said it is overhauling its U.S. operations, which will result in overhead savings of 20%.
The United Kingdom building-materials and construction company is also pumping #100 million ($149 million) over three years into a U.S. capital-investment program "designed to raise productivity and profitability," the company said.
The decision follows a review of its U.S. operations that was begun last November.
Tarmac America, the company's U.S. unit, has operations in quarry products, ready-mix concrete and cement, primarily on the East Coast.
Tarmac will close two existing offices and move its headquarters from Herndon, Va., near Washington, D.C., to an existing office in Norfolk, Va.
The Deerfield Beach, Fla., office will also be cut.
Some 50 jobs are likely to be lost from the 2,000 Tarmac has in the U.S.
