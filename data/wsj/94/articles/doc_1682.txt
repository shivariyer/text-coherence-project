Home Shopping Network Inc. has agreed in principle to settle a lawsuit filed by the former general counsel who alleged a litany of financial improprieties at the company.
The settlement of the suit by Allen P. Allweiss, if completed, would clear away almost all the remaining litigation that engulfed Home Shopping under the reign of Home Shopping founder and former chairman, Roy Speer.
In his suit, filed last year in Florida state court, Mr. Allweiss sought payment under severance and stock-option agreements.
Among other things, he alleged that Home Shopping fired him to keep him quiet about allegations that Mr. Speer and other former Home Shopping executives extracted bribes from vendors, held secret stakes in suppliers and made hush-money payments.
Furthermore, the suit alleged that Home Shopping paid millions of dollars to companies run by Mr. Speer's son, Richard, for bogus services.
Meanwhile, Home Shopping countersued Mr. Allweiss, charging him with insider trading.
An attorney for Mr. Allweiss confirmed that a settlement "in principle" had been reached.
Liberty Media Corp., the majority owner of Home Shopping Network, declined comment.
Home Shopping didn't return calls.
Earlier last month, Home Shopping agreed in principle to pay between $13 million and $16 million to settle nine other suits alleging similar charges of financial misdeeds at the company.
The suits filed in federal court in Tampa, Fla., said the company had failed to fully disclose the questionable financial dealings.
