San Francisco is stewing in its own juices again.
Skunk juice, to be specific.
With the Army closing up shop at the Presidio, its routine eradication of the black-and-white critters there has ended, and they've begun to proliferate on the western side of the city.
Animal-rights doctrine prevents extermination.
The city's "animal care and control" director essentially says, "Get used to it.
They were here first."
