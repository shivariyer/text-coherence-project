Defense conversion is getting off to a slow start, according to a report by congressional auditors.
Much of the money intended to help ease the economic impact of cutbacks in defense spending has been slow in getting into the pipeline, the General Accounting Office report said.
Two federal reviews of the early stages of programs that have received funding found problems, the report said.
A review by the Commerce Department's inspector general concluded that three of six grants made to reduce the effect of defense cutbacks on communities had "a questionable impact."
The Pentagon's inspector general, when looking at a program intended to assist displaced defense personnel in finding new employment, found that "ineffective planning and oversight had resulted in implementation problems," the GAO said.
Asked for comment, a White House aide involved in defense conversion said the GAO review looked only at defense conversion spending through July of last year, when the Clinton administration had been in office only six months.
"A fair amount has happened since then," the aide said.
