Raymond L. Mathiasen, 50-year-old senior vice president, was named to the additional post of chief financial officer at this health-care services concern.
Mr. Mathiasen had been acting chief financial officer since last September, when Taylor Jenson, 54, resigned from that post to become senior financial adviser to the company.
