California's securities commissioner will consider temporarily suspending Prudential Securities Inc. from doing business in the state if the firm doesn't agree to a settlement that he considers fair to investors who bought its limited partnerships in the 1980s.
"What I'm concerned about is that investors be treated fairly in the arbitration-settlement process," Gary Mendoza, the commissioner, said in an interview.
If his office isn't satisfied, Mr. Mendoza said, the state would "give serious consideration to an appropriate enforcement action, which includes an appropriate period of suspension" from doing business in California.
Among the Mr. Mendoza's most significant requests is that Prudential offer to buy back partnership interests from investors who shouldn't have been sold them in the first place, people familiar with the matter say.
Mr. Mendoza declined to comment on the specifics of his talks with Prudential.
"We're very concerned about even considering that," said John Murray, Prudential's director of corporate-risk management.
"We're not in the business of investing in oil and gas."
Prudential Securities is a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
The California action was first reported in the Los Angeles Times.
