Trustees of a pension fund plundered by the late British publisher Robert Maxwell accepted a #32 million ($47.8 million) settlement of their lawsuit against three Maxwell-company financial advisers.
As expected, the settlement by Lehman Brothers, a unit of American Express Co., Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management Ltd. and Invesco PLC was announced Monday, on the eve of the trial here.
Under the settlement, the three defendants didn't admit any wrongdoing.
The lawsuit, by pension-fund trustees of Mirror Group PLC, a former Maxwell company, had charged the three firms with participating in improper securities transactions ordered by Mr. Maxwell in a vain effort to prop up his crumbling publishing empire.
Since Mr. Maxwell's 1992 death, British police have charged the late publisher with plundering at least #300 million from various employee pension funds.
The Mirror Group fund's trustees allege Mr. Maxwell and associates took #88 million from their fund, plus another #150 million from a related fund.
Yesterday's settlement was for the three financial firms' #50 million share of the #88 million Mirror-fund claim; as part of the settlement, the trustees dropped their claim for the additional #150 million.
