United Parcel Service of America Inc. said it will offer on-time guarantees on its international deliveries, matching similar recent commitments by Federal Express.
Previously, UPS offered guarantees only on deliveries in the U.S. and Canada.
Effective March 21, the package-delivery giant will guarantee delivery by 5 p.m. the second business day to 46 countries, and delivery by noon to 13 European countries.
UPS will also guarantee overnight delivery of letters and documents from major U.S. cities to 23 countries.
Federal Express recently announced it would guarantee delivery by noon the second business day to 50 cities in Europe, stepping up from a previous 5 p.m. deadline.
The move is part of UPS's push to improve package-tracing through new technology and to speed delivery times.
Industry analysts said customers are now demanding more precise delivery times to track their inventories and materials.
