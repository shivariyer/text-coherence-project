Aetna Life & Casualty Co. reported its fourth-quarter loss widened considerably because of previously announced restructuring charges of $1.28 billion.
The insurance company said its net loss in the quarter widened to $1.13 billion, or $10.10 a share, from $191.9 million, or $1.74 a share, a year ago.
Last month, the company said it would take $1.28 billion of charges to discontinue part of its pension business, eliminate 4,000 jobs -- or nearly 10% of its work force, and add to workers' compensation reserves.
Following the earnings announcement, Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered the claims-paying ability rating of the company's Aetna Life Insurance Co. to single-A-plus from double-A-minus, citing the large charge.
The rating agency affirmed all Aetna's other ratings, although it revised the outlook on the senior debt rating to negative from stable.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Aetna closed at $63, up $1.25.
For the full year, Aetna swung to a loss of $365.9 million, or $3.29 a share, from net income of $56 million, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier.
Without the charges, the company said operating earnings for the year would have been $610 million, or $5.49 a share, helped by a 7% reduction in operating expenses and improved underwriting and lower catastrophe losses in the property/casualty business.
In 1992, Aetna had operating profit of $192 million, or $1.74 a share.
Aetna "made good progress . . . to improve operating performance in our businesses," said Ronald E. Compton, chairman.
He said the company's aggressive action to reduce the drag on earnings from past business decisions and to control costs and reduce the size of its real-estate portfolio "positions us well to enhance future returns" to shareholders.
As for the S&P downgrade, Aetna said it strongly disagrees with S&P's decision.
"S&P has no basis for this action," said Patrick W. Kenny, Aetna's chief financial officer.
He said that Aetna Life "is an even stronger company than it was a year ago, with improving statutory operating ratios and enormous earnings potential."
