UtiliCorp United Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to buy a Missouri intrastate natural gas pipeline system from Edisto Resources Corp. of Dallas for $75 million.
The utility company said the acquisition of the 218-mile pipeline system includes the gas distribution system at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., along with a pipeline that crosses the Mississippi River north of St. Louis.
The general route of the major portion of the pipeline is from Curryville, Mo., south to Sullivan, Mo., and then west to Fort Leonard Wood.
UtiliCorp, based in Kansas City, Mo., said the addition of the pipelines will help generate growth opportunities for its Missouri Public Service division, and increase its presence in eastern Missouri.
The company said the transaction is subject to regulatory approval.
