Francis J. Kane, 35 years old, was named to the new position of treasurer and vice president, investor relations, of this mining concern.
Mr. Kane assumes the duties of two former vice presidents who left the company last year.
Dennis C. Haugh, formerly treasurer, and Richard H. Hagman, who previously headed the public and investor relations department, opted in December to take a retirement package triggered by the purchase of Amax Inc. by Cyprus Minerals Co.
Mr. Kane joins Cyprus Amax from Bear Stearns & Co., where he was associate director, relationship officer.
