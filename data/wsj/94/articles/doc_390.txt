Compaq Computer Corp., in a move to broaden its base of potential customers, reached an agreement to sell one of its personal-computer models in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. outlets.
The giant discount retailer's roughly 2,000 stores will offer Compaq's hot-selling Presario 425, which retails for about $1,300 and is designed to be used at home.
But in getting onto Wal-Mart's shelves, Compaq is only playing catch-up with such rivals as International Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc., Dell Computer Corp., and Packard Bell Electronics Inc., said David Goldstein, a retailing consultant at Channel Marketing Corp., Carrollton, Texas.
Mr. Goldstein warned that Compaq's sales through Wal-Mart may not be as strong as the computer maker hopes.
He said some of the PC companies that supply Wal-Mart have been forced to take back a significant number of machines that the retailer wasn't able to sell.
