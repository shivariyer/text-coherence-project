Two former executives of Barton Industries Inc. were accused by the government of falsely inflating the value of the company's stock, then profiting from both sales and donations of the shares.
The Securities and Exchange Commission accused C.W. Earl Johnson, former chief executive officer, and Victor L. Joyce, former chief financial officer of Barton, a maker of oil-field equipment in Shawnee, Okla.
Neither defendant could be reached for comment.
The SEC complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma, alleges that the two executives directed "Barton accounting personnel" to falsify sales and thereby overstate earnings by as much as 170% during the 1989 and 1990 fiscal years.
The SEC complaint said both men were terminated by Barton Industries in February 1991, shortly before the company sought bankruptcy-court protection to reorganize its debts.
Barton Industries' assets were sold to another company last November.
