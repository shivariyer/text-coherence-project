The broadest measure of the trade deficit widened $3.45 billion in the fourth quarter to $31.54 billion, the Commerce Department said.
The current-account trade figure covers merchandise, investment income, government payments and services such as travel and tourism.
A decrease in the service surplus, a shift to a deficit on investment income and larger net unilateral transfers more than offset the improving merchandise trade deficit during the quarter.
For the year, the current-account deficit increased to $109.24 billion from $66.40 billion in 1992.
Much of the widening was the result of a widening merchandise trade deficit.
A surplus on investment income accounted for the rest of the increase.
