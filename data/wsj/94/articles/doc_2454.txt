The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it hopes to organize a $300 million renovation of the outdoor plaza, retail concourse and permimeter areas of the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
Port Authority commissioners cleared $10 million to develop plans and cost estimates of such a renovation and may "solicit private development interest."
The renovation is intended to improve pedestrian flow between the plaza and the underground concourse, and "reinvigorate" the shopping mall.
Shopping and visiting in the plaza and retail areas were disrupted for much of 1993 due to last year's bombing in the basement garage of the center's twin towers.
