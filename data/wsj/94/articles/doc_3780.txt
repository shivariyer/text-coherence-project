Pratt & Lambert Inc. said it would buy United Coatings Inc. for cash and stock valued at about $108 million and assume United Coatings' debt.
The company said in October 1993 that it was seeking a merger partner.
The new company will have revenue of more than $415 million, Pratt & Lambert said.
Pratt & Lambert makes architectural finishes, chemical coatings and adhesives for the industrial and consumer markets.
Its 1993 sales were about $242 million.
United is a closely held producer of architectural finishes, which are sold predominantly under private label.
Its 1993 sales were about $175 million.
Under the terms of the transaction, Pratt & Lambert will issue five million shares of common stock to United Coatings shareholders, pay about $17 million in cash and assume United Coatings' debt.
The amount of debt wasn't disclosed.
Joseph J. Castiglia, Pratt & Lambert's president and chief executive will continue in his same positions at the new company.
Jules Knapp will remain president and CEO of United Coatings, which will become an autonomously operated unit of the new company.
Six representatives of United shareholders, including Mr. Knapp, will join Pratt & Lambert's seven-member board to form the board of the new company -- to be renamed Pratt & Lambert United Inc.
R.D. Stevens Jr. will continue to serve as chairman, and Mr. Castiglia and Mr. Knapp will be vice chairmen.
Corporate headquarters will remain in Buffalo.
