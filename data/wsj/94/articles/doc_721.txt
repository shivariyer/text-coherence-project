Pre-Paid Legal Services Inc. said the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked the company to change its accounting methods as part of a review of a planned $7.5 million stock offering.
Though the Ada, Okla., company said it believes its accounting practices are proper, it said the commission's questions likely will delay the offering indefinitely.
In American Stock Exchange trading Friday, Pre-Paid fell 43.75 cents to $1.5625 a share.
At issue is the way the company, which markets legal-service plans, accounts for commissions and other costs involved in closing contracts.
The company since 1975 has amortized costs over the expected life of service contracts.
The SEC, according to Pre-Paid, has suggested that the company expense those costs as they are incurred.
Pre-Paid said the changes, if adopted, would force the company to restate its operating results upward for 1991 and 1992.
However, earnings before taxes for 1993 would fall from $516,000 to a pretax loss of $569,000.
