Packard Bell Electronics Inc. said it moved out of its headquarters here following extensive damage from last week's earthquake.
The nation's fourth-largest personal computer maker said it relocated its administrative, technical-support and production operations to 160,000 square feet of leased space in Westlake Village, about 20 miles from here.
Until the headquarters was moved over the weekend, much of the closely held company was run from the Chatsworth parking lot, where departments were organized around groups of conference-room tables.
Packard Bell officials said the initial damage from the quake was compounded by flooding last Wednesday, when city crews restored water service, setting off fire sprinklers and flooding the damaged building.
The company said about 70% of its production capacity was temporarily knocked out.
Most of that work is now being shifted to the new Westlake site.
Packard Bell also said it has accelerated the previously announced move of its technical-support business to Utah.
That operation, initially not scheduled to open until March, will now begin taking calls by early February.
Meantime, Packard Bell said it's continuing to search for a permanent headquarters site.
As to whether that new home would be in California, officials declined to comment.
