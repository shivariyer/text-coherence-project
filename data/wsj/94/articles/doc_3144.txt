Provident Bankshares Corp., Baltimore, said it ended acquisition negotiations with Sterling Bancorp following a due-diligence review.
On Dec. 15, Provident signed a letter of intent to acquire Sterling, a Baltimore bank with assets of $70 million.
The stock transaction had an indicated value of about $10.8 million.
Provident, with assets of about $1.8 billion, says it discovered during its due-diligence investigation that Sterling's business "was not what we had been led to believe when Sterling initiated merger discussions."
Provident didn't elaborate.
In response, Sterling said it filed a lawsuit in a state court in Baltimore, seeking to continue the acquisition, contending Provident violated its agreement.
