Moody's Investors Service said it lowered its ratings of the telecommunications company's senior long-term debt to single-A-2 from single-A-1, citing the company's "continuing difficulties in achieving adequate earnings from its diversification strategy."
The move affects about $225 million of debt.
MIDLANTIC Corp. -- Standard & Poor's Corp. raised its ratings on about $400 million of debt of this banking company, including raising senior debt to double-B-plus from double-B.
S&P, which removed the ratings from its CreditWatch review list, said Midlantic's financial performance continues to improve, and noted favorable trends in disposing of problem assets.
The asset moves should let Midlantic concentrate on lending initiatives and exploit its market position in New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania, S&P said.
Midlantic is based in Edison, N.J.
