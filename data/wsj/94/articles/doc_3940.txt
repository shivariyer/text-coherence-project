Northwest Airlines paid its top five officers bonuses totaling nearly $2.4 million in 1993, a year when the company narrowly averted a bankruptcy-law filing by persuading employees to accept steep pay cuts.
John H. Dasburg, the airline's president and chief executive, received a 1993 bonus of $450,705 on top of his $463,906 salary, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The filings are related to a planned initial public offering of the nation's fourth-largest airline.
Mr. Dasburg also received a bonus of $750,000 as a special one-time payment for his role in restructuring the company's finances in 1992 and 1993.
The bonuses prompted some gripes from union members, who along with noncontract employees, agreed to $886 million in wage cuts last summer to help prevent a threatened bankruptcy filing by Northwest.
The top officers took salary reductions of nearly 20% as part of that plan, a Northwest spokesman said.
In exchange, Northwest's employees, including managers, received a 34.2% stake in the company.
Northwest views bonuses as necessary incentives for management, said a spokesman for the carrier, adding that Mr. Dasburg's $750,000 payment was "in lieu of hiring an investment banker" to handle such tasks as renegotiating loan obligations.
Union representatives hold three seats on Northwest's board, and a pilots union official sits on the board's Compensation Committee.
