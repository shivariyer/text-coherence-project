Dutch merchant bank MeesPierson NV said net profit rose 4.2% in 1993 and that excluding extraordinary items, earnings surged because of buoyant stock markets and falling interest rates.
MeesPierson is a subsidiary of the Netherlands' largest banking group, ABN Amro Holding NV.
It is the product of the 1993 merger of Bank Mees & Hope NV and Pierson Heldring & Pierson NV.
The company said net profit last year gained to 223 million guilders ($117.4 million) from the year-earlier 214 million guilders.
The year-earlier figures are restated for the disposal of the company's Lease Plan Holding subsidiary.
But excluding extraordinary items in both reporting years, operating profit rose 45% in 1993 to 211 million guilders from 146 million guilders, the company noted.
