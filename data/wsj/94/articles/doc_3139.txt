Electronic Arts said its proposed acquisition of Broderbund Software Inc. can proceed to shareholder votes, after the Federal Trade Commission last week cut short the waiting period required under federal antitrust law.
The companies have scheduled special shareholder meetings for May 20 to vote on the deal.
Electronic Arts, of San Mateo, Calif., said it received word last Tuesday from the FTC of early termination of the waiting period.
The union of Electronic Arts' flair for entertainment software programs, with Broderbund's expertise in educational games, would gird the combined company for battle against rivals such as Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft Corp.'s home software unit, and Acclaim Entertainment Inc. of Oyster Bay, N.Y.
