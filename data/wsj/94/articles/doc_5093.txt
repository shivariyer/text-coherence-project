Consolidated Natural Gas Co. said improving prices and increased deliveries pushed operating profit higher in the fourth quarter, but net income declined 11%, due to special items.
For the quarter, the natural gas concern reported net income of $86.1 million, or 93 cents a share, compared with net of $97 million, or $1.05 a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue increased 30% to $1.03 billion.
The 1992 fourth quarter included a gain of $5.7 million, or seven cents a share, from changes in income-tax reporting, as well as a reversal of an estimated $9.7 million liability related to the company's liquefied natural gas operations.
Without the special items, the company said earnings would have increased about 5% during the fourth quarter.
The company said bitterly cold weather in the first few weeks of 1994 will benefit the company in the first quarter.
In New York Stock Exchange trading, Consolidated Natural Gas stock declined 87.5 cents to $44.50.
