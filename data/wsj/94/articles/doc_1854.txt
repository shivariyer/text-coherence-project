Liposome Technology Inc. said it will resume selling its Amphocil drug in the United Kingdom, following a positive ruling by British authorities.
Liposome, of Menlo Park, Calif., said that the U.K.'s Medicines Control Agency has confirmed that revisions to the company's clinical data don't affect the agency's earlier approval of Amphocil, which fights fungal infections that sometimes accompany chemotherapy and organ transplants.
In December, Liposome had opted to delay U.K. sales to review the data, reducing slightly the reported percentage of people who responded to the treatment.
In late Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Liposome's stock rose 12.5 cents to $8.875.
