Fibreboard Corp., declaring the company isn't for sale, disclosed and rejected an unsolicited $42.50-a-share buyout bid from Minnesota financier Carl Pohlad.
The company, which makes building products and owns ski resorts, said that Mr. Pohlad made the offer late Friday in a faxed letter.
The bid values Fibreboard at about $178.5 million.
Fibreboard's flat rejection seemed to make an impression on investors.
After a delay in the start of trading, Fibreboard's shares opened at $38 a share but eased back to close at $37.125, up $2.625 in American Stock Exchange trading.
Mr. Pohlad already owns a 6.8% stake in Fibreboard, and said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in mid-December that he might seek control of the company.
He didn't return phone calls yesterday.
Fibreboard has become an attractive target because of a financial turnaround and a pending settlement of $3 billion in asbestos personal-injury claims.
The company's stock was trading as low as $6.875 last year, before the proposed settlement with the company's insurers was announced in August.
The shares hit $35 after Mr. Pohlad's December disclosure and topped $38 in February, after USA Today columnist Dan Dorfman reported that a bid may be imminent.
John Roach, Fibreboard's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company's management and directors studied Mr. Pohlad's offer and concluded that it fell short of the company's true value.
"Our shareholders have done well," Mr. Roach said in prepared remarks.
"But we believe there are still substantial gains to come in light of Fibreboard's prospects and the value of its assets."
Fibreboard owns more than 80,000 acres of Sierra Nevada timberland and produces a variety of building materials.
It purchased the Sierra Ski Ranch at Lake Tahoe last year.
Mr. Roach, who joined the company in 1991 from Manville Corp., helped improve the company's finances by cutting costs and selling marginal assets.
In 1993, the company earned $11.7 million, or $2.62 a share, compared with $9.4 million, or $2.30 a share, in 1992.
Sales rose to $265.2 million from $239.7 million.
Mr. Roach said that all of the company's operations are now profitable.
"We are now at a point where we can make strategic acquisitions in existing or related businesses," he added.
Mr. Pohlad, 78 years old and leading an investor group called CRP 3800 Inc., had reported that it purchased 283,000 shares between Nov. 12 and Dec. 17 at prices ranging from $27.12 to $32.37 each.
