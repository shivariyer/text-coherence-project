U.S. corporate giving to charitable causes was flat last year and is expected to remain stagnant this year, according to an annual survey by the Conference Board.
Although the economy is improving, executives are still cautious about making increases in budgets and budget estimates, said Maria Buenaventura, author of the study.
The Conference Board said that when complete data become available, they will confirm a less than 1% increase in corporate giving for 1993.
The board's just-completed survey for 1992, co-sponsored with the Council for Aid to Education, showed corporate gifts were up 2.7%.
The percentage is based on a median number from 272 companies that also responded to the previous year's survey.
The greatest share of the contribution dollar, 37.1%, went to education, followed by health and human services, at 27.7%.
Although the 1992 increase was slightly higher than the median 2% change reported in 1991, it still indicates slower growth in corporate contributions when compared with an 8% growth rate in the mid-1980s, and 5% in 1990, the Conference Board said.
Although there is relatively flat growth for contributions in the U.S., there is a rise in overseas giving, Ms. Buenaventura said.
