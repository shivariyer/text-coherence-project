Camden Property Trust said it arranged a $75 million credit line.
It wouldn't identify the lender.
The new loan increases the company's credit lines to $135 million, of which $75.3 million is currently unused.
The real estate investment trust said the loan, which will bear interest at a variable rate based on the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, will enable it to add multifamily properties to its portfolio.
