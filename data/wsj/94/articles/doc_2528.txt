Michigan National Corp. said it will eliminate some senior management jobs as part of a restructuring plan aimed at bolstering its profitability.
The Farmington Hills, Mich., bank-holding company said it's consolidating its core financial businesses to remove management layers and operate more efficiently.
Michigan National said the restructuring along with other cost-cutting steps already taken will reduce its expenses $30 million this year and $35 million in 1995.
Robert J. Mylod, Michigan National's chairman and chief executive officer, said it isn't clear yet how many senior management jobs will be eliminated.
In January, Michigan National said it will shut 12 bank branches in Michigan and eliminate 80 jobs this year to cut costs.
It added that it also is to decide whether to shed operations in California and Texas.
"All of this is being done to make us more efficient and a more effective company," said Douglas E. Ebert, newly hired president and chief operating officer.
