E-Systems Inc. said E. Gene Keiffer stepped down as chief executive officer and intends to retire in August as chairman.
The defense-electronics concern named its president and chief operating officer, A. Lowell Lawson, to succeed Mr. Keiffer as CEO.
The company said Mr. Lawson, 56 years old, is also expected to succeed Mr. Keiffer as chairman.
Mr. Keiffer, 64, is to remain on the board after his retirement as chairman.
The company also said it named Brian D. Cullen a senior vice president, in addition to his duties as president and general manager of E-Systems' largest division, located in Greenville, Texas.
Mr. Cullen, 53, will share operational responsibilities with two other senior vice presidents, Terry Heil, 55, and Peter Marino, 51.
Industry analysts said Mr. Keiffer's departure as chief executive wasn't unexpected and they generally praised the company's moves.
"The biggest positive is the nice continuity," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
In a news release, Mr. Keiffer said the management changes were designed to facilitate an orderly transition and streamline management at a time when the defense contractor is seeking to expand into lines of business unrelated to defense.
