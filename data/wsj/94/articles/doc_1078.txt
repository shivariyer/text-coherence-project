The Supreme Court said some state judges are giving juries confusing instructions in criminal trials, but it said the problem isn't grave enough to require reversal of convictions.
The ruling came as the high court affirmed the convictions and death sentences of two defendants.
The murderers, who were convicted in Nebraska and California, had challenged definitions that judges gave at their trials of "beyond a reasonable doubt," the standard for proving guilt in criminal prosecutions.
Yesterday's ruling would have been more important had it come out the opposite way.
Thousands of convictions in at least 15 states could have been attacked if the justices had found that the jury instructions at issue were unconstitutional, not simply hard to understand.
Instructions in the California and Nebraska cases stated that to be convinced "beyond a reasonable doubt," jurors had to be sure "to a moral certainty."
Defense lawyers argued that this phrase, combined with others, allowed convictions based on too little proof of guilt.
In the high court's main opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor expressed concern that "moral certainty" is an archaic term that could befuddle jurors.
But she said that when taken as a whole, the instructions at issue adequately conveyed the idea that unless jurors have "an abiding conviction" of a defendant's guilt, they should vote for acquittal.
The federal courts steer clear of terms such as "moral certainty."
However, Justice O'Connor said that in the absence of a constitutional violation, the Supreme Court shouldn't meddle in state-court procedures.
The justices voted unanimously to uphold the instructions in the California case; the vote was 7-2 to affirm in the Nebraska case.
