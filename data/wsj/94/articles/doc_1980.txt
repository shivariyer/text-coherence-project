Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, an influential lawmaker on ethical issues, became the first senior Democrat to suggest the need for Congressional hearings into the Whitewater affair.
"When a complicated issue such as the Whitewater matter is affecting the president's agenda, he must get the facts out quickly and completely," said Mr. Hamilton, who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee and previously led the House inquiry into the Iran-Contra scandal.
He noted the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Fiske "may not be made public for some time," and that congressional hearings represent "one possibility" for clearing the air.
Mr. Hamilton's statement, immediately seized upon by Republicans who have demanded hearings, heightened pressure on President Clinton and the Democratic congressional leadership.
They have resisted hearings so far, citing Mr. Fiske's warning against possible interference with his investigation.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) reiterated his opposition to hearings, and aides to House leaders insisted that Mr. Hamilton's remarks didn't represent a weakening in the party's position.
