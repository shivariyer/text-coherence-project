James F. Smith, former chairman and chief executive officer of Orange & Rockland Utilities Inc., was indicted in Rockland County District Court here on charges that he misappropriated about $30,000 in company funds.
Mr. Smith filed a plea of not guilty and was released on his own recognizance.
He faces four counts of grand larceny in the third degree, four counts of grand larceny in the fourth degree and two counts of petit larceny.
He has been scheduled for a court appearance on May 24.
The Rockland County district attorney's office alleged that Mr. Smith diverted funds from the Pearl River, N.Y., utility to his family and friends.
Among the allegations: $7,000 in holiday baskets for friends, family and a Maine real-estate agent, and $3,037 in moving costs for a family member.
Mr. Smith couldn't be reached for comment.
Messages left at the office of Mr. Smith's attorney weren't returned.
The Associated Press reported that Jay D. Fischer, a lawyer for Mr. Smith, said his client is "innocent of any criminal wrongdoing."
Orange & Rockland, which dismissed Mr. Smith in October 1993, filed a civil suit against the former chairman in February seeking $5 million in recovered funds and damages.
Kenneth Gribetz, Rockland County district attorney, said much of the evidence that led to Mr. Smith's indictment stemmed from an internal investigation being conducted by Orange & Rockland.
Mr. Gribetz said his investigation into activities at the company are continuing.
Orange & Rockland has been shaken by financial scandal since the indictment of former executive Linda Winikow on charges of bribery and larceny.
She pleaded guilty to the charges in October and is scheduled for sentencing in April.
Since her plea, two former employees have been charged in a false-billing scheme.
Also, two executives with financial oversight responsibilities were dismissed by Orange & Rockland earlier this month.
