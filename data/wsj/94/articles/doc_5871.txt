Key Production Co. said it signed a letter of intent to acquire $23 million of oil and natural-gas properties from a seller that wasn't identified.
The energy concern said the producing properties, located primarily in Wyoming and Utah and several Rocky Mountains basins, would add about 2.6 million barrels of oil and eight billion cubic feet of natural gas to Key Production's reserves of roughly 1.5 million barrels of oil and 28.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
Key Production said the agreement is subject to negotiation of a binding purchase and sale agreement and likely will be completed in May.
