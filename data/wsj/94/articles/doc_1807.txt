The Canadian government conditionally approved a proposed acquisition by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of 122 Woolco stores in Canada from Woolworth Corp.'s Canadian subsidiary in Ottawa.
The government said Wal-Mart, as part of its acquisition proposal, pledged to offer employment to almost all of Woolco's 16,000 employees.
Wal-Mart also pledged to give Canadian suppliers a "full and fair opportunity" to supply Wal-Mart's Canadian stores and to increase its purchases of Canadian books, magazines, video and audio recordings.
