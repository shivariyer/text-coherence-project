CenCall Communications Corp. said it completed an offering of senior redeemable discount notes due 2004, and will use net proceeds of $241.2 million to fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements related to its high-capacity digital mobile networks, as well as for future acquisitions.
The bonds, noncallable for five years, pay no interest for the first five years and thereafter carry a 10 1/8% coupon.
The offering was managed by Merrill Lynch & Co.
