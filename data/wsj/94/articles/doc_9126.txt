A Curtiss-Wright Corp. unit settled for $17.5 million a civil fraud case in which the U.S. government had charged the defense contracting concern with defrauding and overcharging it.
The civil action resulted from a related criminal prosecution in which 10 employees of the unit, Target Rock Corp., East Farmingdale, N.Y., were convicted.
Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter said Target Rock, which makes valves used by the Navy in its nuclear fleet, allegedly mischarged labor hours to Navy contracts and submitted false invoices and expense reports.
Curtiss-Wright said the settlement, which wasn't an admission of liability, would reduce net earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 1993 by about $8.4 million, or $1.67 a share, and result in a loss for those periods.
For the first nine months, the company had net income of $8.1 million, or $1.61 share.
