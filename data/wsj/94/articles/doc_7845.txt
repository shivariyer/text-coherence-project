You've always suspected it, and now you know it's true: Houstonians like to feel above everybody else -- even when they're sitting.
In a soon-to-be-released study, Michael Lynn, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Houston, found that waiters in two Houston restaurants who squatted beside their customers' tables received higher tips than those who stood.
A male graduate student who waited tables at a Mexican cafe tested 270 groups of customers -- squatting for about half of them.
The result: His average tip came to 17.5% of the bill when he squatted, compared with 15% when he stood.
In a similar test at a Chinese restaurant, a female graduate student received an average tip of 15% while squatting, compared with 12% while standing.
"Squatting is friendlier," says Dr. Lynn.
"You increase the postural congruence and eye contact, and that raises the level of intimacy."
Now, for the tough question: Why would anybody study this in the first place?
Well, be assured that this isn't yet another dubious project financed with federal grant money.
"Nobody paid for it, we just did it," says Dr. Lynn.
And the reason?
He says he has been curious about tipping techniques ever since he waited tables at several restaurants to put himself through college.
