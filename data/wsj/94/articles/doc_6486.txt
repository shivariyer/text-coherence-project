Orange & Rockland Utilities Inc., Pearl River, N.Y., said it would pay $439,096 to customers in New York and New Jersey to account for improperly spent funds.
The refund payments stem from the misappropriation of funds by a one-time Orange & Rockland Utilities executive, Linda Winikow.
Ms. Winikow, formerly vice president of corporate policy and external affairs, has pleaded guilty in Rockland County District Court to making illegal campaign contributions as well as grand larceny and commercial bribe receiving.
Her sentencing is scheduled for early April.
The utility said New York electric customers who use about 500 kilowatt hours a month got about 37 cents credit for November and December and will get an additional 18.5 cents credit in January.
Gas customers received about 40 cents credit for November and December and will receive an additional 20 cents in credit.
New Jersey electric customers will receive about 45 cents credit over a two-month period beginning Feb. 3.
New York state regulators continue to investigate Orange & Rockland.
The utility said it is actively cooperating with the investigation.
New Jersey regulators are looking into the company as part of a previously planned management audit.
