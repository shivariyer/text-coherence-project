Derlan Industries Ltd. said it agreed to purchase the net assets of Energy Container Corp. of Santa Anna, Calif.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Derlan, based in Toronto, said Energy Container designs, develops and makes metal and composite aircraft-fuel tanks, and a proprietary line of patented cryogenic and petrochemical valves.
It has 105 employees and sales of C$16 million ($12 million) a year.
Derlan said that it will consolidate three of its California aerospace operations, together with Energy Container, into one large plant.
These initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on Derlan's U.S. Aerospace earnings beginning in 1994 and accelerating in 1995, it added.
