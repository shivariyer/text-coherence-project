Moody's Investors Service Inc. upgraded its long-term debt rating of Cardinal Health to Baa-1 from Baa-2, citing an improving business profile.
About $250 million in debt was affected.
The ratings agency said Cardinal Health, formerly named Cardinal Distribution Inc., will benefit from an "enriched customer mix" and wider geographic reach following its recently approved acquisition of Whitmire Distribution Corp.
The combined companies are expected to have about $6 billion in pharmaceutical sales this year.
Moody's added that it expects Cardinal to benefit from cost savings and operating synergies stemming from the acquisition.
