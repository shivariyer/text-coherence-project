In your Feb. 2 article "Car Thieves Score Big in Smaller Cities," you depict Commerce, Calif., as a small city with a tremendous vehicle-theft problem by factoring 636 vehicle thefts into our small residential population of 12,586.
The resulting figure is completely distorted.
Commerce is an industrial community.
In fact, the 1,800 businesses located here cover 80% of its 6.6 square miles, while its residential area covers only 20%.
Therefore, when evaluating the number of vehicle thefts or other crimes, it is imperative to factor in our large industrial population -- which increases our total population to 75,000.
When we factor our industrial population rate quotient, we arrive at a much more realistic rate of only 848 vehicles stolen per 100,000 residents.
Also, most of the car thefts occur at a shopping center adjacent to an unincorporated area of East Los Angeles.
