In reference to your Feb. 17 Marketplace article "With Free Help, the Religious Turn Litigious," I believe that the article was slanted quite heavily against The Rutherford Institute.
You never once mention the major reason for the need for organizations such as The Rutherford Institute -- the rise of organizations such as the ACLU, which themselves provide free litigation to pursue their own humanistic agenda.
Time and time again, I have heard about ACLU suits that are brought against those who are attempting to exercise their religious freedoms.
Without free legal representation, Christians who face the ACLU are soon forced to accede to the ACLU's wishes, or pay astronomical legal fees, while friends of the ACLU pay nothing for legal expenses.
Organizations such as The Rutherford Institute are merely serving to keep the playing field equal.
While you don't actually state that Christians are generally "poor, uneducated, and easily led" as another well-known paper recently did, you infer that we're really quite a misdirected lot.
For example, you characterize Operation Rescue as a militant anti-abortion group.
While this may be true to some, it is also true that the ACLU has stood with individuals and organizations far more militant than Operation Rescue.
Moreover, you quote one individual as indicating that The Rutherford Institute is "one of the scariest phenomena that I've seen in my 30 years of education."
I could say much the same for the ACLU, which has not ceased to promote its humanistic objectives through aggressive litigation over more than 30 years.
It's obvious that you are using this article to once again paint the "religious right" as some militant, ill-informed group that doesn't represent the mainstream in the U.S. today.
