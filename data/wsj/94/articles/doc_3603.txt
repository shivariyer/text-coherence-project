Nippon Paper Industries Co., one of Japan's largest paper manufacturers, will help build and operate a factory near St. Petersburg, Russia, that will produce paper for use in fax machines, a spokesman said.
Fax Roll Finance, a Finland-based joint paper-making venture in which Nippon Paper Industries holds a 31% stake, will provide the financing for Fax Roll Russia, the entity that will operate the factory, the spokesman said.
The governments of Finland and Russia also hold stakes in Fax Roll Finance and will provide some of the financing for the project.
