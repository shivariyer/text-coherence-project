Integrated Waste Services Inc., Buffalo, N.Y., said it expects to post a loss of about 25 cents a share for the fourth quarter and is considering "several restructuring alternatives" to restore profitability.
The provider of waste management to government, commercial and industrial customers said it expects to post a loss of about 20 cents a share for the year as a result of its quarterly loss.
It had earnings of $961,000, or 12 cents a share, in the 1992 fourth quarter.
For the year, it earned $813,000, or 10 cents a share.
The company further said it anticipates a loss in the first quarter of 1994.
Integrated said it has begun preliminary negotiations with its major lending institutions to resolve covenant violations from existing loans.
A spokesman said the losses mainly are attributed to poorly performing contracts.
Another factor is the disappointing performance of recent acquisitions, which the company had expected to boost earnings, and economic conditions, especially in Canada.
