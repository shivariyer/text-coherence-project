Sales of Japanese cars in Western Europe surged 13.5% last month, outperforming most European and U.S. brands.
Japanese brands accounted for 11.6% of new-car registrations in Western Europe, up from 10.9% in January 1993.
Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. were the top performers, with sales gains of 31% and 26%, respectively, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
The figures confirm European producers' fears that their Japanese rivals, as they make inroads, are likely to be the main beneficiaries of a recovery in the auto market.
Lagging behind the Japanese were two of Europe's largest car makers, Volkswagen AG and Fiat SpA.
VW's market share dropped to 15.5% from 16.6%, as its sales slipped 0.4% to 160,460 units.
Fiat's market share fell to 12.1% from 13.2%, while sales dropped 1.7%.
But Daimler-Benz AG's sales jumped 54% and Rover Group Holdings PLC's sales increased 22%.
