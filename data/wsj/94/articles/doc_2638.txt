Although Mr. Applegate of CS First Boston expects corporate profits will continue to surpass expectations this year, he recently lowered his estimate for the stock market because he thinks dividend growth will lag.

While profit gains will be robust because of increased labor productivity, he says dividend growth tends to be more closely correlated with revenue gains, which aren't likely to be as healthy.
