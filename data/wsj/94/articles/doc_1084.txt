Nantucket Industries Inc., which hasn't reported a quarterly profit since the fall of 1992, announced top management changes and new financing.
Nantucket, a maker of underwear for men and women under the Guess? label, has had substantial operating losses at a manufacturing facility it acquired in Puerto Rico.
Partly as a result, the company expects to post "significant" losses in the first quarter ended May 30.
Nantucket said its president, Steven Samberg, 49 years old, was named to the additional positions of chairman and chief executive.
In those positions, he succeeds principal stockholder George Gold, 72, who retired.
Another principal stockholder, Donald Gold, 68, retired as full vice chairman.
The company also named Ray Wathen to its board, and said two other directors, Drew Wofford, 70, and Philip Gold, 62, resigned, leaving six members.
Nantucket said it closed on a $15 million revolving credit line with Congress Financial, a financing institution owned by CoreStates Financial Corp.
Nantucket said Samberg Group, a Delaware limited liability company owned by Mr. Samberg, Ray Wathen and other officers of the company, contributed $1 million to the company in exchange for convertible preferred stock at a conversion rate of $5 a share.
Additionally, Chemical Bank will provide a $2 million loan, Nantucket said.
