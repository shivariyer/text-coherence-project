Cyrix Corp. cited a "manufacturing difficulty" for a 71% plunge in fourth-quarter earnings, indicating that its strategy of cloning chips made by Intel Corp. may be much harder than expected.
The Richardson, Texas, chip maker's net income fell to $1.2 million, or six cents a share, from $4 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 22% to $32.8 million from $27 million.
The earnings were in line with analysts' expectations.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the Cyrix stock closed at $19.75, down 25 cents.
In recent years, Cyrix has been touted as a serious competitor to Intel.
As part of its plan to grow quickly, Cyrix opted not to build its own manufacturing facilities but instead use outside contractors.
Problems arose when its primary contractor began using a more complex technology, said a company spokeswoman.
"At least for the short term we have solved that problem.
In December, we managed to ship quite a few units from this new technology," she said.
