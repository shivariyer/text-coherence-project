Robert J. DiNicola, 46 years old, was named chairman and chief executive of the nation's largest jewelry chain operator.
Mr. DiNicola, the chairman and chief executive of the Bon Marche division of Federated Department Stores Inc., will join Zale April 18.
Zale has been without a permanent chairman and chief executive since its board ousted Dean Groussman last August, within days of the company's emergence from Chapter 11 reorganization.
Andreas Ludwig, previously the company's chief financial officer, served as interim chief executive from August until his departure in January to become managing director of Tyrolit Industries, a heavy-industry manufacturer owned by Austria's Swarovski International Holding AG.
Mr. DiNicola, who spent a decade at R.H. Macy & Co. before joining Federated in 1989, has no jewelry experience; but that is less of a concern since the appointment in December of Larry Pollock, a long-time jewelry executive, as president and chief operating officer.
Mr. DiNicola, credited with repositioning the department store chain and strongly increasing sales, had been considered a candidate to succeed Chawim Y. Edelstein as chief executive of Federated's largest department store division, Abraham & Strauss/Jordan Marsh; but within a week of Mr. Edelstein's resignation in late January, former R.H. Macy executive Harold Kahn was named to that post.
Mr. DiNicola couldn't be reached, but in a written statement, he said he looks forward to working with Mr. Pollock, "who will partner with me in guiding Zale in the upcoming years."
