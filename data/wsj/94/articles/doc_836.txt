Program trading for the week ended March 18 accounted for 30.4%, or an average 100.7 million daily shares, of New York Stock Exchange volume.
This included program trading related to the March 18 quarterly expiration of stock-index options and futures.
Brokerage firms executed an additional 51.8 million daily shares of program trading away from the Big Board, mostly on foreign markets.
Program trading is the simultaneous purchase or sale of at least 15 different stocks with a total value of $1 million or more.
Of the program total on the Big Board, 38.5% involved stock-index arbitrage, up from 26.3% for the prior week.
In this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
Some 50.9% of program trading was executed by firms for their own accounts, or principal trading, and 28.9% was for their customers.
An additional 20.2% was customer facilitation, in which firms use principal positions to facilitate customer trades.
Of the five most-active firms, Nomura Securities, Susquehanna and UBS Securities executed all or most of their program trading for their own accounts, while Morgan Stanley did most of its trading for its customers and First Boston split its program activity between its own accounts and those of its customers.
