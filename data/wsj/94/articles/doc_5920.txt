Japan's Finance Ministry plans to boost issuance of its debt by more than 20% in the next fiscal year.
The ministry announced Wednesday that it will boost issuance of 10-year bonds in the market by about 3.2 trillion yen ($29.42 billion) and issuance in other maturities by about 4.36 trillion yen in the next fiscal year, which starts April 1.
This past fiscal year, the ministry has issued three-month and six-month treasury bills and two-year, four-year, five-year, 10-year and 20-year paper.
The ministry will add six-year bonds next fiscal year.
The sharp boost in Finance Ministry debt issuance, following the government's decision to finance at least temporarily a 6 trillion yen cut in taxes with bonds, looks to bring total floatations to a record 36.531 trillion yen.
The ministry at this point estimates issuance for this fiscal year at 29.916 trillion yen, but that doesn't yet include financing for the third supplementary budget due out this week, a ministry financing aide told reporters.
The burden of financing on the market will be increased further by a cutback in purchases by the finance ministry's trust-fund bureau, which plans to shave its buying by 3.6 trillion yen next fiscal year.
The trust-fund bureau manages money for such arms of the government as the Postal Ministry's savings and insurance accounts and the Health and Welfare Ministry.
