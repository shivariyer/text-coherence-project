Nasdaq is moving quickly to lift limitations on reporting stock trades in sixteenths of a dollar, according to the chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
The move, expected to be considered by the NASD board as early as next month, comes in response to a specific recommendation in the recent Market 2000 report by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The staff suggested reporting stock trades in sixteenths, rather than the traditional eighths of a dollar, as an interim step toward eventual decimalization, or reporting in tenths of a dollar.
Nasdaq now allows trades in stocks valued at $10 a share or less to be reported in sixteenths rather than eighths.
Trades above $10 a share must be reported in eighths.
The NASD board will be asked to do away with the $10 ceiling at its meetings in March and May, NASD Chairman Joseph Hardiman said.
The change would have to be approved by the SEC.
Mr. Hardiman said the Nasdaq shift to reporting in sixteenths would more accurately reflect the large number of institutional trades that are negotiated in sixteenths, but rounded up to the next eighth for reporting purposes.
Separately, the SEC is scheduled to consider another Market 2000 recommendation at its meeting today.
The staff has suggested that the agency require brokers who operate automated trading systems to keep records of participants, volume and transactions.
The SEC will also consider an unrelated rule requiring large securities traders to register annually with the SEC and requiring brokers to keep records of the large traders' accounts that would be available to the agency.
Large traders would file annually with the SEC and report their identity and accounts, the SEC said.
