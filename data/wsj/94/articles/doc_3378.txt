Victoria Financial Corp. said a higher-than-anticipated number of claims stemming from brutal winter weather will adversely affect its first-quarter earnings.
The Cleveland specialty insurance company said heavy snow, ice and frigid temperatures created hazardous road conditions, contributing to the high number of auto insurance claims in January and February.
The company said sales volume has been improving, however, and it expects that trend to continue.
Victoria, which specializes in nonstandard automobile insurance, had net income of $521,000, or eight cents a share, on revenue of $11.1 million in the 1993 first quarter.
