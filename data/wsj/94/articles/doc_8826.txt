Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Co. said John Clymer, its president and chief executive officer, resigned to "re-enter the investment management business."
Mr. Clymer, 46 years old, said in a letter the company made public that he plans to manage either institutional or private funds, from a base in St. Paul.
He joined the $10 billion-asset mutual insurance concern in 1972 as an investment analyst, served as vice president of investments, and was named president in 1991.
He became chief executive last year.
Coleman Bloomfield, the 67-year-old chairman of Minnesota Mutual's board of trustees, who relinquished the CEO title to Mr. Clymer eight months ago, will serve as chief executive while the company conducts a search for a successor.
