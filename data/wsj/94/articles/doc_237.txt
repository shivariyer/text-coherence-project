McDermott International Inc., New Orleans, said it formed joint ventures with Russia's JSC Amur Shipbuilding Plant for marine construction, shipbuilding and fabrication of ship parts at the Amur shipyard in the Khabarovsk Region of the Russian Far East.
One venture, McAmur Construction Services Co., will provide fabrication services for marine-construction projects in the offshore waters of Far East Russia.
McDermott and JSC will own equal shares of the venture, and expect McAmur will participate in the expansion of oil and gas development there.
The second joint venture, to be called McAmur Shipbuilding Co., will market the shipbuilding and ship-part fabrication capabilities of the Amur shipyard on a world-wide basis.
Each partner will own 50% of the company.
The Amur shipyard is in Komsomolsk on the Amur River.
