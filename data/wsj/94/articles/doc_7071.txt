The share price of Banco Espanol de Credito, known as Banesto, plummeted 57% yesterday as it resumed trading after being suspended for more than a month.
The shares closed at 855 pesetas ($6.11) in heavy trading, sinking from their previous close of 1,995 pesetas Dec. 28, the day the Spanish central bank dismissed the board and assumed control of the troubled bank.
Still, market analysts in Madrid said the Banesto shares fared better than many had expected.
Last week some analysts were speculating that the stock could fall as much as 75% when trading resumed.
"No one was expecting it to go this high," said Javier Sunye, senior salesman at Madrid brokerage concern Benito y Monjardin SVB.
"People are just taking positions for the short term . . . speculating with the stock."
Many analysts agreed that there's not enough information to help shareholders decide what to do with their Banesto shares and they suspect that small shareholders are confused.
The big questions looming are the details of a 180 billion-peseta rights issue, as well as a shareholders meeting scheduled for March and whether some other bank will acquire Banesto.
Analysts and dealers agreed that trading in the coming days could be radically different from the first day as the shareholders who held Banesto stock before it was taken over become more active in the market.
"We don't know what the man on the street is thinking, and that's who really counts now," said Ana Belen Colmenero, a banking analyst at Maxwell Espinosa AVB in Madrid.
A team led by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Vice Chairman Alfredo Saenz is in charge of drawing up a restructuring plan for Banesto.
