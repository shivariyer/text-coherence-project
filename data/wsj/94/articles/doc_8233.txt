MONEY MAGAZINE, which is part of Time Warner Inc.'s publishing unit, recorded a 3.3% drop in its advertising pages in 1993.
An article Thursday incorrectly stated that Money's ad pages declined 7.5% last year, based on figures from Publishers Information Bureau that didn't include Money's extra, year-end edition.
