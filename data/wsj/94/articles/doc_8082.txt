Scandinavian Airlines System named Jan Stenberg, currently executive vice president at Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, as chief executive officer.
Mr. Stenberg, 54 years old, will take the controls of the troubled Scandinavian airline April 1.
SAS's ownership is equally divided among Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
His task will be to find a strategy for an airline still struggling from the failed diversification effort launched by his predecessor, the flamboyant Jan Carlzon, who left last year after his plan for a merger with three other European airlines failed.
SAS has reported a pretax loss each year since 1990, and is expected to report a loss for 1993.
As previously announced, Jan Reinas, who acted as interim chief executive, will leave to take the helm of Norwegian paper and pulp concern Norske Skog AS.
The SAS board is apparently counting on Mr. Stenberg's experience as an international negotiator to help the airline in its search for tighter links to the European continent.
SAS already has a three-way marketing alliance with Swissair and Austrian Airlines, and Mr. Stenberg hinted that this grouping will be a key to his plans.
"We should deepen the current cooperations and should seek new ones," he said.
"But it's open to question as to the form and timing" of such moves.
