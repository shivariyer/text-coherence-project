Phoenix Laser Systems Inc. said it intends to contest involuntary bankruptcy proceedings filed against it by two former employees and Microdyne Inc.
Phoenix, based in Fremont, Calif., said it hadn't received formal notification of the Jan. 31 filing but called it "a spurious and malicious attempt to discredit the company."
Trading in the company's shares was halted by the American Stock Exchange yesterday after Phoenix disclosed the filing.
The company, which develops integrated laser systems for medical and industrial use, said it learned the former employees' claim was based on "golden parachutes" for senior employees, which the company said had been rescinded by its board.
Phoenix said it had no ownership interest in Microdyne, a communications and local-area network concern based in Escondido, Calif.
Microdyne officials couldn't be reached for comment.
