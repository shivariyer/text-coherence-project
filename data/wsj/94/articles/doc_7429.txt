Tenneco Inc. said its chairman, Michael Walsh, underwent surgery to remove dead tissue remaining from a brain tumor discovered last year, but that his prognosis appears favorable.
The company said the surgery, performed Saturday in Boston, is considered standard.
Tests before and after the operation confirm earlier diagnoses that Mr. Walsh appears to have no active tumor lesions.
The 51-year-old chairman was diagnosed with a midgrade brain tumor in January 1993.
He underwent a treatment of radiation and chemotherapy.
In November he reported that his doctors told him the tumor had stopped growing and was breaking up.
Mr. Walsh has continued his regular duties at Tenneco, a $13 billion industrial corporation which he has been leading through a restructuring program.
