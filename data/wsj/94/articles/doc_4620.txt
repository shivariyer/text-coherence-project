Jonathan Caplan, 41 years old, president of this shoemaker's children's group, was named president of its Keds Corp. unit.
He will be succeeded by Margaret Whitman, 37, who had been executive vice president of Keds.
Mr. Caplan succeeds Dominic Ferlauto, 55, who was named to the new post of president of new business development.
The company said Mr. Ferlauto was given the new job to expand marketing to mass merchants.
It said the move wasn't related to a recent decline in sales of Keds sneakers.
