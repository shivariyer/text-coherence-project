Union Camp Corp. said fourth-quarter net income more than doubled to $17.6 million, or 25 cents a share, from $7.3 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier, mainly because of one-time items.
Revenue for the quarter at this paper, packaging, and building products company in Wayne, N.J., rose 7% to $793.8 million, from $744.3 million a year earlier.
Pretax income from operations rose 14% to $54.9 million.
"Earnings in our paper and paperboard business continued to be negatively affected by weak pricing," said Gene Catledge, chairman and chief executive officer.
"On the other hand, our overall shipments were up 8%, as the improving economy continued to increase demand, in particular for linerboard and packaging."
The latest quarter included a $4.2 million gain, or six cents a share, from sale of land; the year-earlier quarter included a $5.6 million charge, or eight cents a share, from early retirement of debt.
