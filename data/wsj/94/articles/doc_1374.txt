Citic Pacific Ltd., a China-controlled, Hong Kong-listed investment conglomerate, said its net income during 1993 surged 81% to 1.89 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$244.5 million).
Despite difficulty in some of its aircraft and trading businesses during 1993, Citic Pacific Chairman Larry Yung said the group had "another fruitful year."
Motor car trading under the Dah Chong Hong group managed high, but reduced, sales and market share in Hong Kong, which was marked by significant competition.
Despite Chinese government attempts to control credit and inflation in moves singling out luxury goods such as cars, Citic's Dah Chong Hong said it recorded satisfactory sales growth on the mainland.
The company said other parts of its Dah Chong Hong trading business, including DCH Food Marts, developed well in 1993.
Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd. had a "milestone" year in 1993, with record profit and the introduction of new Airbus planes, Citic Pacific said.
But, as reported, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. had a difficult year in 1993, with earnings reduced due to a strike by cabin crew members, persistent inflation and weakness in its major markets.
Citic Pacific said its 10%-owned Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd. continued to perform well, with "a strategic role" foreseen for the company at Hong Kong's new airport.
On the back of its successful bid, along with many other companies, last year in a tunnel project related to the new airport, Citic Pacific said it will bid to operate a roadway linking the tunnel with mainland China.
