Japan's Honda Motor Co. has been undertaking a feasibility study to set up an assembly plant for vehicles in Mexico, a Honda spokesman said.
Though no definitive decision has been made for construction of a car plant, Honda, which already has a motorcycle and a repair-parts plant in Mexico, sees the country as a market with a "high potential" for its automobiles, he said.
Among Japanese auto makers, Nissan Motor Co. is the only company that has a vehicle-assembly plant in Mexico.
Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. affirmed its Prime-1 ratings of short-term debt of Honda Motor and two of its overseas financial arms but downgraded senior unsecured debt of the company in Japan and the two overseas units to single-A-2 from single-A-1.
In announcing the action on $3.6 billion of debt of the parent and of Honda International Finance BV and American Honda Finance Corp., Moody's cited its "belief that Honda's earnings and debt-protection measurements will continue to be adversely affected" by business weakness in Japan, decline in efficiency in the company's plants there and competition in North American and European markets.
