Dynamics Research Corp., battered by losing a contract, expects to report net income fell 80% on a 5% drop in revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Dec. 25.
Albert Rand, president and chief executive officer, said the Boston-based provider of computerized systems for the military expects to report net for the period fell to about $365,000, or seven cents a share, from $1.8 million, or 35 cents a share.
Revenue fell to $31.7 million from $33.4 million, he said.
As previously reported, Dynamics Research lost a $15 million a year contract to manage engineering specifications for the Hanscom Air Force Base in Lexington, Mass.
Mr. Rand said that pieces of the contract were won by seven other companies, many of which won them under small business or minority set-aside prorgams.
Most of those companies have ended up subcontracting with Dynamics to continue doing the work, but at a lower price.
Despite the weak quarter, Mr. Rand he is "upbeat" about the current year, but didn't make specific projections.
