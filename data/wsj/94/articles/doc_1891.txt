German sports car manufacturer Porsche AG announced it has priced shares in its 1-for-4 rights issue at 575 marks ($338).
The company plans to issue 17.5 million marks ($10.3 million) in nominal capital.
With each share valued at a nominal 50 marks, that equals 350,000 shares.
The rights issue therefore will raise 201.25 million marks in cash before expenses.
Holders of the new shares will be entitled to half of any dividend paid for the fiscal year ending July 31.
Stuttgart, Germany-based Porsche paid preferred shareholders a 2.50-mark dividend for the previous fiscal year.
The shares are being offered to all holders of common and preferred shares via a consortium led by Dresdner Bank AG, the company said.
Half of the shares will be purchased by the Porsche and Piech families, who own the common shares.
Subscription period is March 22 to April 7.
Separately, Porsche revealed that it's developing two completely new models this decade in a strategy to replace its aging series of luxury sports cars.
