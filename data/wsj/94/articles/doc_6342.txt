Quebecor Printing Inc. said it signed a letter of intent to buy a 49% stake in Groupe Jean Didier of France for 165 million French francs ($27.6 million).
Quebecor Printing would inject capital in the French printing company and buy shares from its founder and chairman, Jean Didier.
The Montreal commercial-printing company would also have the option of raising its stake eventually in Groupe Jean Didier to 80%; terms of the option weren't disclosed.
The transaction is scheduled for completion by June 30, subject to due diligence and approval by Quebecor Printing's board.
Groupe Jean Didier has more than 2 billion francs in annual revenue and more than 1,700 employees.
The investment would be the second in Europe for Quebecor Printing, which last year acquired a majority stake in another French printer.
