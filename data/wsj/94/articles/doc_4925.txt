Purolator Products Co. said it will shut down the glass fiber manufacturing process at its Henderson, N.C., plant as of April 15.
The company said it plans to purchase glass fiber from outside sources.
Purolator will reserve about $950,000 in the first quarter for one-time costs associated with shutting down the process.
Annual savings are estimated at $500,000.
The move will affect about 100 of the 360 workers at the factory.
