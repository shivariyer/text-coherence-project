Kaiser Aluminum Corp. said it will cut production of aluminum by about 40,000 metric tons, or about 9.3% of its annual output.
A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
The aluminum producer, 61%-owned by Maxxam Inc., blamed low aluminum prices and a world-wide oversupply.
The cutbacks will be made in April.
Kaiser said that, after the reductions, it will be operating at about 77% of its total annual capacity of 508,000 metric tons.
