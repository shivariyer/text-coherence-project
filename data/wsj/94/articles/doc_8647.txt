TakeCare Inc., Concord, Calif., said some of its shareholders have filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court to block its proposed $829 million acquisition by FHP International Corp.
The holders, who collectively own 22% of TakeCare's stock, allege that the company's board neglected its fiduciary duties in agreeing to sell the company.
That agreement was announced Jan. 10.
TakeCare and FHP, based in Fountain Valley, Calif., are both health-maintenance organizations.
Their planned combination would create one of the three largest publicly traded HMOs in the country.
TakeCare said the suit is without merit and that it is proceeding with plans to close the deal.
