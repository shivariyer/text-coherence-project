Atlantic Richfield Co., as expected, agreed to sell its 12-year-old landmark office tower in Dallas to Texas Utilities Co. for $29 million.
The 49-story building, designed by I.M. Pei, cost about $190 million to build.
Arco previously said it would take a charge against 1993 fourth-quarter earnings to reflect the sale of the building and other items, but the company hasn't disclosed the precise amount of the loss on the real estate.
The sale has generated controversy in Dallas because agents for other prospective purchasers claimed that Arco failed to respond to higher bids submitted by their clients.
These critics claimed that Arco negotiated a cut-rate price for the property because the utility is a major customer.
Arco has declined to comment on such allegations.
