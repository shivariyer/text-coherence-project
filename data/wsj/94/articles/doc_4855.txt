ROTHMANS Inc. said in Toronto that it plans to distribute 104.5 million Canadian dollars (US$77.6 million) to its shareholders in the form of a special dividend.
The tobacco and cigarette manufacturing concern declared a special dividend of C$18 (US$13.43), payable March 17 to shares of record March 3, in addition to its usual quarterly dividend of C$1 a share.
The company said it opted to pay surplus funds to shareholders as it has no plans to diversify beyond the tobacco business.
Before the announcement of the dividend, Rothmans stock changed hands at C$96 a share on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
It didn't resume trading.
