Oxford Health Plans Inc., citing a surge in membership, said fourth-quarter net income grew 93% and revenue more than doubled.
Earnings totaled $4.7 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $2.4 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue grew to $95.9 million from $46.6 million.
Oxford, based in Norwalk, Conn., markets health plans to employers.
It said it added 360 employer groups and 17,000 individual members in the latest quarter, increasing year-end individual membership 85% to 217,500.
An average 6.9% overall premium-rate increase approved by the New York state Insurance Deptarment for 1994 should have a positive impact on this year's results, Oxford said.
For the year, earnings increased 32% to $14.9 million, or 91 cents a share, from $11.3 million, or 74 cents a share, in 1992.
