Faced with burdensome terms demanded by his would-be partner, Donald Trump is attempting to find another financing source for his long-stalled Manhattan development project.
Over the past month, Los Angeles-based Colony Capital Corp. had increased its demands for ownership in the mixed-use Riverside South development project to nearly 80%, according to two sources familiar with the negotiations.
Mr. Trump has balked.
"We are prepared to go forward, but because of the immense complexity, only on very specific criteria," said Thomas Barrack Jr., Colony's president and chief executive officer.
"I don't see the deal happening," said Mr. Trump.
Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Barrack would discuss specifics of the negotiations.
Chase Manhattan Corp., which had tentatively agreed to sell Colony its roughly $250 million loan on the property for between $80 million and $100 million, declined to comment.
Among the alternative sources approached by Mr. Trump are the real estate investment arms of financiers George Soros and Michael Steinhardt.
Both organizations declined comment on whether they were approached.
Riverside South, a mixture of 5,700 apartments, 375,000 square feet of retail and office space, and 25 acres of park, stretching along the Hudson River on Manhattan's Upper West Side, was stalled for years by community groups, who succeeded in forcing Mr. Trump to scale down its size and add public amenities.
