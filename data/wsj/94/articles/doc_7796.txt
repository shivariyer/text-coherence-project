The Russian prosecutor general's office opened a criminal investigation against the extreme nationalist member of parliament Vladimir Zhirinovsky, according to news agencies here.
The probe was reportedly prompted by complaints that Mr. Zhirinovsky had been spreading war propaganda.
Mr. Zhirinovsky, at a news conference Wednesday, denied these reports.
"Forget about anyone trying to open a criminal case against me.
Better think about those against whom criminal cases will really be opened in the near future," he said, referring to his critics.
Under Russia's criminal code, a person convicted of peddling war propaganda could be sentenced to three to eight years in prison.
Though Mr. Zhirinovsky's membership in parliament confers immunity, he could still be convicted for acts committed before he was elected on Dec. 12.
Among those who have recently accused Mr. Zhirinovsky of spreading war propaganda is former First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, who earlier this month resigned from President Boris Yeltsin's cabinet in protest against a backward tilt in economic policy.
