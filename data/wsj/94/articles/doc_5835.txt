Mexpetrol SA, a consortium of public and private Mexican companies, is negotiating the purchase of Cuba's Cienfuegos refinery, according to people close to the talks.
Mexpetrol is 25%-owned by state oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos.
Cuba's Cienfuegos refinery has a capacity to refine about 60,000 barrels a day of crude.
However, half the refinery never was built.
The refinery is said to be running at about 25,000 barrels a day.
