The Securities and Exchange Commission said it obtained a temporary restraining order from a federal judge against a San Diego couple that is accused of defrauding more than 550 investors in the U.S. of more than $8 million.
The SEC action was taken against Steven and Judith Jones as well as their company, American Mortgage Fund Inc.
The agency contends that contrary to promises to purchase mortgages and government securities, the Jones's used investors' money for their own business expenses.
The couple also failed to disclose that they personally borrowed investor monies, the SEC said.
Among other things, the agency said it is seeking disgorgement from Mr. and Mrs. Jones of all "ill-gotten gains."
The restraining order blocks the couple from any further violations of securities laws and freezes their assets and the company's assets.
The couple and their attorney didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
