News Corp. signaled its intention to expand in magazines by creating posts at a new magazine division.
Joseph Barletta, the 57-year-old president and chief executive officer of News Corp.'s TV Guide, was named to the added post of president of Murdoch Magazines.
Anthea Disney, the 48-year-old editor-in-chief of TV Guide, will also become editorial director of Murdoch Magazines.
News Corp. hasn't had a separate magazine division since selling most of its magazines in 1990, and the only magazine it now publishes besides TV Guide is a woman's magazine, Mirabella.
The magazines had been overseen by Patrick Purcell, who also ran News Corp.'s U.S. newspapers and its newspaper advertisinginsert business.
Mr. Purcell just agreed to buy News Corp.'s Boston Herald newspaper and is leaving the company to run it.
The announcement of new magazine executives came just a day after News Corp. pulled the plug on a magazine it had been testing, Married Woman.
Only one issue came out, but sales were disappointing, the company said.
Mr. Barletta, who joined News Corp. six months ago after a long career in newspapers, said, "The response to Married Woman was underwhelming, but there will be other magazines started and acquired.
Anthea and I wouldn't have taken these positions if there wasn't real commitment from News Corp. and Chairman Rupert Murdoch to grow in magazines."
Ms. Disney added, "We want to apply the expertise we already have at News Corp. to magazines, and that means we'll aim primarily at the areas of entertainment and news."
Separately, the founder and creator of Married Woman, Kelly McGee, said she is searching for another publisher to fund her magazine.
