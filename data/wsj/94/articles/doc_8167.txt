Don Edwards, the dean of the California delegation and a powerful voice for civil liberties as the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, is expected to retire at the end of this year, after more than three decades in Congress.
The 79-year-old lawmaker has scheduled a news conference for this morning in his San Jose district.
His retirement is the most significant in a series of departures that will drastically alter the committee's hierarchy.
Only yesterday, Rep. Bill Hughes (D., N.J.), chairman of the subcommittee on intellectual property and judicial administration, announced his retirement.
And Rep. Romano Mazzoli (D., Ky.), a subcommittee chairman who gave his name to landmark immigration legislation in the 1980s, has said he won't seek another term.
The moves will expand the influence of Rep. Mike Synar, an outspoken, populist-styled Oklahoman who at just 44 years old next year will rank behind only Chairman Jack Brooks of Texas and John Conyers of Michigan.
With major telecommunications legislation pending, Mr. Synar will have power bases in both the Judiciary and Energy and Commerce committees.
More broadly, he reflects a generation of younger members rising amid the upheaval in Congress.
By contrast, Mr. Edwards's reasoned, dignified style has long set him apart in the House, and despite his liberal image today, he was a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent as a young man and came to Democratic politics only after a career in business.
As chairman of the Civil and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee, he was major player in civil-rights disputes with the Reagan and Bush administrations and more recently has been a strong proponent of abortion-rights legislation.
