Liberty Technologies Inc. completed its acquisition of Industrial NDT Co. for $5.5 million.
Liberty said the purchase price included $2 million in cash, 317,460 Liberty common shares and a contingent payment of as much as $500,000, based on Industrial NDT's operating performance in 1994.
Liberty said it expects the acquisition to increase its annual revenue by more than 50%.
Liberty had 1993 revenue of $18.6 million.
The purchase is not expected to dilute per-share earnings in 1994.
Industrial NDT provides testing, inspection and process-safety-management-compliance services for industrial-process industries.
Industrial NDT had sales in 1993 of about $11 million, Liberty said.
