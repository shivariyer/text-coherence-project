Chase Manhattan Corp. said its board raised the regular quarterly dividend 10% to 33 cents a share.
It also announced it will give all full-time employees stock options with certain incentive provisions.
The bank holding company said the dividend increase is the first change since 1990, and reflects its "significantly improved performance."
The dividend is payable Feb. 15, to holders of record Jan. 31.
Under the stock-option plan, each full-time employee will receive 400 stock options with an exercise price based on yesterday's average selling price.
The options carry vesting provisions tied to future increases in Chase's stock price.
The higher the stock price, the sooner the employees become vested.
Full vesting could come in as soon as three years if the stock trades at an average of $60 per share.
If the performance-based vesting conditions aren't met, the options vest after nine years.
The company said the program wouldn't cause a charge to earnings, and that dilution of per-share earnings isn't expected to be significant.
Earlier this week, Chase reported earnings up more than 50% for the year.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Chase closed at $35.375, down 37.5 cents.
