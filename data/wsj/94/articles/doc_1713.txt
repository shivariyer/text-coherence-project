He-Ro Group Ltd., New York, said it completed the restructuring of all of its debt outstanding, after having reached a definitive agreement to restructure a $3.2 million loan with Hong Kong-based Delta Asia Financial Group.
He-Ro, which makes women's apparel sold under the labels "Niteline" and "Black Tie by Oleg Cassini," had restructured debt with domestic lenders in January.
He-Ro said its loan with Delta will be secured by a pledge of 1.3 million newly issued shares of He-Ro common stock.
After the loan is repaid in May 1995, the collateral will be returned to He-Ro.
Having resolved its debt problems, He-Ro "can more fully concentrate its attention on the strategic redirection of its operations," said William Carone, He-Ro chairman.
In the first six months of fiscal 1994, which ends May 31, He-Ro had a net loss of $22.8 million on sales of $60.4 million.
The loss included a $17 million restructuring charge.
