Ames Department Stores Inc., Rocky Hill, Conn., said earnings for the nine weeks ended Jan. 1 fell 93% to $62.2 million but rose significantly on an operating basis.
For the year-earlier period, the company reported net income of $884.2 million, propelled by a one-time gain.
The latest period's results compare with profit, before extraordinary items, of $26.1 million for the year-earlier period ended Dec. 26.
Ames, which emerged from federal bankruptcy-law protection Dec. 30, 1992, said a $391.2 million write-down of assets under new reporting rules stemming from its emergence from Chapter 11 was offset partly by a one-time $1.24 billion gain from the discharge of debt.
Sales for the nine weeks fell 5% to $568.4 million from $601 million.
The company said it doesn't expect January to be profitable and predicted only modest profit for the year ending Jan. 29.
It plans to provide per-share figures when it reports fourth-quarter and full-year results in April.
