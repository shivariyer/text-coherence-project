A federal-court jury rejected a claim by a Chicago businessman that his now-defunct company failed in 1990 due to racial discrimination by Adolph Coors Co.'s Coors Brewing Co.
Felix A. Burrows Jr. sued Coors under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 in U.S. District Court here, alleging that Coors had canceled orders for brewing-machinery parts for racially motivated reasons.
Those cancellations caused his Great American Tool & Manufacturing Co. to fail, Mr. Burrows alleged.
Mr. Burrows had sought compensatory and punitive damages in excess of $20 million.
The jury rejected Mr. Burrows's claim after a two-week trial.
Coors testified that it had provided Mr. Burrows with no-interest loans and expedited payment of its invoices to try to help him stay in business.
Rather than canceling orders, Coors increased its orders for parts to $64,000 a month in 1990 from $5,200 a month in 1986, the brewer argued.
When Great American failed, it held $58,000 in unfilled orders from the brewer, Coors said.
Mr. Burrows couldn't be reached immediately for comment.
