Concerning your Jan. 28 page-one article on the Robbies' sale of the Miami Dolphins to Wayne Huizenga: as the person closest to Joe Robbie's finances prior to his death and to the Dolphins and Joe Robbie Stadium finances after his death, I submit the following:
After Joe Robbie's death in 1990, the Robbie trustees did not close a transaction with M. Huizenga that their father "wouldn't."
Mr. Robbie realized that he needed an equity investment in his team and stadium.
Had he not died, he would have completed the Huizenga transaction.
Time has proven that Mr. Robbie and the trustees made the right move by bringing in Mr. Huizenga as a partner.
The team and stadium have come from a dismal financial condition at Mr. Robbie's death to a sound condition in 1993.
The Dolphins will show a profit in 1993, not the $7 million loss reported by your source.
Team player salaries were ninth highest of the 28 NFL teams.
The Robbie trustees have worked diligently to make the team and stadium successful for their collective family interests.
The sale of the Dolphins to Mr. Huizenga was the prudent step for the trustees and the sale will withstand scrutiny.
