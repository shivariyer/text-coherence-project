Russia and an international consortium of companies led by Marathon Oil Co., a unit of USX Corp., have agreed to the terms of a production-sharing contract for a huge oil and gas project off Sakhalin island.
The project relates to two offshore fields -- Piltun-Astokhskoye and Lunskoye -- that are estimated to hold one billion barrels of oil and 13 trillion cubic feet of gas.
Development costs are estimated at more than $9 billion.
Sakhalin island is about five miles off the coast of Siberia, and about 18 miles north of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island.
The consortium said a protocol was signed by its representative and Russia's Deputy Minister for Fuels and Energy V. Dvurechensky in Moscow on Tuesday.
But a signing of the proposed production-sharing contract is subject to approval of the negotiated terms by both the Russian government and by members of the consortium.
Moreover, the consortium said, work on the project would commence only after Russia's parliament had taken "appropriate action."
The Marathon Oil-led group's bid for the Sakhalin-2 project in Russia's remote east began in May 1991, when it and others were invited to tender proposals by Sakhalinmorneftegas, the local Russian production association.
At that time, the group comprised Marathon Oil, McDermott International Inc. and Mitsui & Co.
The Russian government declared the group the winner early in 1992.
Later that year, Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Mitsubishi Corp. joined the group, now known as the MMMMS consortium.
Marathon Oil has a 30% interest in the group, McDermott, Mitsui and Shell each have 20%.
Mitsubishi holds the remaining 10%.
The group didn't disclose details of the terms negotiated with Russia.
However, Western oil industry officials say terms for such projects typically are based on a 15% to 20% return on investment over the life of the contracts.
