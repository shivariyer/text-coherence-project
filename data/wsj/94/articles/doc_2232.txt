Earnings of General Mills Inc. edged up 2.9% in the fiscal third quarter, on a 4.5% sales rise.
The lackluster results for the quarter ended Feb. 27, which were expected, were blamed by the company on breakfast-cereal promotion wars and restaurant results hit by winter storms.
Sales rose to $2.1 billion from $2.01 billion previously; earnings climbed to $145 million, or 91 cents a share, from $140.9 million, or 86 cents, after a five-cent per-share restructuring charge a year earlier.
But operating earnings for the company's consumer-foods sector fell 2% in the latest period, while those for its restaurant sector were unchanged, despite more units open this year.
The Minneapolis-based company blamed "continued promotional escalation" in ready-to-eat cereals, a reference to competitors' use of more coupons and other discounts, which General Mills has been forced to match.
It said its dollar share of the $8 billion U.S. cereal market was 29.7%.
Harsh weather and the California earthquake hurt sales at the Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurant chains.
Average U.S. store sales were off 2% at the Red Lobster seafood restaurants, and those at the Olive Garden Italian chain fell nearly 6% during the quarter.
The company said current-quarter packaged food volume is expected to be spurred by new-product activity.
Promotional efforts also are targeted for the restaurant operations.
Before its fiscal year ends in May, General Mills said it expects to open another nine China Coast Asian-cuisine restaurants, for a total of 25.
General Mills stock rose 62.5 cents, or 1.2%, to close at $54.375 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
