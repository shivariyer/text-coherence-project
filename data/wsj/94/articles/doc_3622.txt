Hollywood producer Dawn Steel, capping months of on-and-off talks with Turner Broadcasting System Inc., signed an exclusive movie-production deal with Turner Pictures.
Ms. Steel, 47 years old, is forming a new film company, Atlas Entertainment, with her husband, producer Charles Roven, and his partner, Bob Cavallo.
Turner Pictures will have exclusive, first-look rights at the total of two or three action and animated movies that Atlas plans to make each year, according to Scott Sassa, president of Turner Entertainment Group, which oversees Turner Pictures.
Ms. Steel says her deal with Turner covers more than two years, "but less than five."
She wouldn't dislose financial terms of her contract and said her production budget will be determined on a movie-by-movie basis.
Turner Broadcasting originally pursued Ms. Steel, the former president of Columbia Pictures, to run Turner Pictures.
Those talks broke down earlier this year because Ms. Steel preferred a production deal with Turner Pictures, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
Her current arrangement with Turner Pictures gives the producer an unusual degree of autonomy, say people close to Ms. Steel.
