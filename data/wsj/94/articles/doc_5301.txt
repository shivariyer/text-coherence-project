A federal court here dismissed the airline industry's challenge to higher landing fees at Los Angeles International Airport.
The court's action comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court's 7-1 ruling last month rejecting the industry's challenge of a separate landing fees increase at Kent County International Airport in Grand Rapids, Mich.
The justices stressed in that ruling that they would prefer the Transportation Department resolve such disputes.
Los Angeles officials and the airlines have been in a standoff since July, when the city trebled the fees to $1.56 per 1,000 pounds of maximum landing weight from 51 cents -- an increase to about $900 from $300 for each Boeing 747.
The battle reached a crescendo in September, when the city threatened to start grounding planes of airlines that had refused to pay the higher fees, some 74 carriers in all.
After the federal Transportation Department intervened, the airlines agreed to pay the higher fees, under protest, pending the court's ruling on their case.
James Landry, president of the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group that sued the city on behalf of the nation's airlines, said Judge Wallace Tashima's dismissal of the case is "evidence that the airline industry has little protection against the monopoly powers of airports."
"Federal law must be changed to provide airlines some legal recourse to challenge questionable airport fees and charges which inevitably are passed on to our customers," Mr. Landry added.
"From the outset, we have told the airlines and the public that this lawsuit was doomed to failure," Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan said.
"The recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court -- which we anticipated -- has validated our approach and our strategies.
The airlines are running out of options in their desperate maneuvers to preserve their sweetheart deals."
