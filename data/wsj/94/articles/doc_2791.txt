The cigarette price war took its toll on the compensation of Philip Morris Cos.
Chairman and Chief Executive Michael A. Miles.
Mr. Miles's base salary and bonus in 1993 was $1.3 million, compared with $1.8 million in 1992.
The company said the drop in compensation reflects the decline in Philip Morris's operating profit last year due to price cuts of its Marlboro cigarettes.
Those cuts occurred on April 2, now referred to as Marlboro Friday.
Philip Morris's proxy also discloses that Mr. Miles received no base salary increase in 1993.
The salary freeze was the suggestion of Mr. Miles.
William Murray, Philip Morris's president and chief operating officer, was subject to the salary freeze as well.
He received a lower base salary and bonus in 1993 than in 1992.
In addition, Mr. Miles received stock options for 125,000 shares at the option price of $49 a share.
Philip Morris closed at $56 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange trading.
Mr. Miles did not exercise any stock options in 1993.
In 1992, Mr. Miles received a $2.2 million long-term performance award covering the company's performance for the three years ended Dec. 31, 1992.
The next three-year cycle ends Dec. 31, 1995.
