Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on this diversified food processor's senior, unsecured debt to Baa2 from single-A-3, saying that "any sustainable and significant recovery of Borden's cash flow and debt protection measurements will take some time to achieve."
The change affects $1.88 billion of long-term debt.
Moody's also said that, despite four restructuring charges over the past four years, Borden's operating earnings "continued to decline."
