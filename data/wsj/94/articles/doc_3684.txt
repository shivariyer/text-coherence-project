Pall Corp. said profit rose sharply in its fiscal second quarter, and it has set a goal of 10% to 15% growth in per-share earnings for the entire fiscal year.
The East Hills, N.Y., maker of industrial filtration products said it had net income of $22 million in the quarter ended Jan. 29, or 19 cents a share, up from $3.3 million, or three cents a share, a year earlier.
Profit in the year-earlier quarter was reduced by $17.3 million in after-tax restructuring charges.
Revenue rose to $171.1 million from $168.5 million a year earlier.
President Eric Krasnoff said Pall has revised downward its sales goal for the fiscal year, to a range of $720 million to $725 million, due to exchange rates.
In November, the company said it expected sales to reach $743 million.
But he said per-share earnings should grow at a greater rate than sales due to cost-cutting moves.
For the six months, net was $33.1 million, or 29 cents a share, up from $14.2 million, or 12 cents a share.
Revenue fell to $314.3 million from $318.3 million.
