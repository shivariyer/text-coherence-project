Totes Inc., a maker of umbrellas and other products, said it hired the investment banking firm of Wasserstein Perella & Co. to evaluate the possibility of outside investors acquiring a stake in the company.
The closely held company didn't say which companies or individuals might have made an offer toward acquiring a stake in Totes, which is based in Loveland, Ohio.
But it stressed that it didn't want to make "significant changes in strategic direction or management control" in any such transaction.
