McDonald's Corp. said it plans to repurchase as much as $1 billion of its common stock within the next three years.
If exercised in full, the buyback plan would represent, at current prices, about 17.4 million shares, or an indicated 4.9% of the company's 353 million shares outstanding at Sept. 30.
The fast-food concern said it will fund the repurchases primarily through excess cash flow, "while maintaining a strong equity base to support the future growth of our world-wide business."
The company noted that over the past 10 years it has spent $2.2 billion to buy back common stock.
McDonald's also noted that it recently announced plans to accelerate its expansion, and will add between 900 and 1,200 restaurants annually in 1994 and in following years, with about two-thirds outside of the U.S.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Mcdonald's shares rose 62.5 cents to $57.50.
