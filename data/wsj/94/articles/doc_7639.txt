Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures said Michael Nathanson resigned as executive vice president of the studio.
Mr. Nathanson's departure had been expected for some time.
He was appointed to the post last year when Lisa Henson was brought in from Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit to succeed him as head of production at the studio.
The move took him out of direct operating responsibility for movie making.
Mr. Nathanson, 38 years old, declined to comment.
Studio executives said he is close to an agreement to join New Regency Productions, the film company of producer Arnon Milchan.
A spokesman for New Regency couldn't be reached.
