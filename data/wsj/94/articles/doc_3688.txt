General Electric Co.'s and Motorola Inc.'s lighting divisions said they jointly will market fluorescent lamps using GE's tubular bulbs and Motorola's electronic ballasts.
A ballast provides a high-voltage discharge to start a fluorescent lamp and maintains the energy at a certain level.
Traditional electromagnetic ballasts are being replaced by electronic ballasts, which are 30% more efficient, New York-based GE said.
The companies said a new line of electronic ballasts will be used in a lighting system "that combines technologies and products of both businesses."
Motorola is based in Schaumburg, Ill.
GE Lighting said the alliance marks its entry into the nearly $500 million a-year market for electronic, tubular, fluorescent ballasts in North America.
The companies said they intend to collaborate on other lighting products.
