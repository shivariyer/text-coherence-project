A group of the nation's biggest mailers urged the Postal Service's board to raise rates by 10.3%, a move designed to head off a larger increase.
The group, called the Mailer's Council, said it was the first time the business community has united to seek an increase.
The council is comprised of 60 companies and trade associations representing the Postal Service's biggest customers.
The boost being considered by the postal board would raise rates for all classes of mail by 10.3%.
The price of mailing a typical first-class letter would rise to 32 cents.
Postmaster General Marvin Runyon has said he backs the increase, rather than an overall 13.8% rate rise that would hit various classes of mail differently.
The board is expected to make its decision next month, but any rate increase wouldn't take effect until next year.
Mailer's Council officials said approval of the 10.3% rise would keep the business community from suing over the rate increase.
Earlier boosts have led to litigation, as groups jockeyed over which classes of mail would bear the highest burden.
The business association said it realizes that the smaller increase would only be a stopgap.
The rise would be "minimally sufficient for the Postal Service's needs for the next two years," the Mailer's Council managing director, Arthur Sackler, said.
