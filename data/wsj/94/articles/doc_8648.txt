Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Montreal, agreed to merge its investment management unit with T.A.L. Investment Counsel Ltd., one of Canada's biggest pension-fund management firms.
The bank will pay 65 million to 70 million Canadian dollars (US$49.5 million to US$53.3 million) in cash or shares for a 55% ownership interest in the merged company.
But T.A.L. will retain management control and majority board representation.
T.A.L. and CIBC will exercise equal voting rights in the company, which will operate under the T.A.L. name.
The agreement fits with a trend among Canadian banks to expand into investment management, following recent deregulation.
The merged company will have about C$20 billion in assets under administration.
The merger, subject to due diligence and regulatory approval, is expected to close around Feb. 28.
