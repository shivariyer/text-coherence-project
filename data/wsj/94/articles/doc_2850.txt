Shopsmith Inc. said it will close all but one of its remaining retail stores over the next two months as part of a reorganization that will cause a "substantial restructuring charge" in the final quarter of its fiscal year, ending March 31, and force layoffs of about 40 employees.
The company, a producer and distributor of hobby woodworking equipment that once had 40 U.S. outlets, reported a net loss of $827,000, or 35 cents a share, on sales of $14.3 million in the year-ago quarter.
Shopsmith said it would close 22 Shopsmith/Woodworking Unlimited retail stores, keeping just one company-owned store, in Dayton, where it is based.
The new charge is separate from one announced for the third quarter.
The company's moves are aimed at shedding its retail network -- which proved costly to operate -- in favor of manufacturing and field sales-promotion operations.
