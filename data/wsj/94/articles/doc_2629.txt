Madison Group Associates Inc. said its board dismissed Kenneth Lucas, president, naming Dean J. Trantalis as interim president.
The company also said two new directors -- Roland Breton and Steve Gibboney -- had been appointed to its board.
Mr. Lucas became chief executive of the media concern less than two months ago, when William T. Craig resigned from his job as a director and chief executive officer.
The company gave no reason for Mr. Lucas's dismissal.
Neither he nor Madison executives could be reached for comment.
The management change is the latest in a series of events that have shaken the company in recent months.
As previously reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission contacted several individuals about their dealings with the company.
One of those individuals said the SEC had asked about how the company valued its assets.
Those assets consist largely of video libraries.
According to a recent securities filing, an accountant formerly hired by Madison recommended that an independent specialist be hired to evaluate the video libraries.
