Manatron Inc. said its president and chief executive officer Allen F. Peat completed a $2.1 million private purchase of 430,000 shares, or 15.6%, of the company's common stock.
Mr. Peat said he purchased the shares from Manatron's vice president and director, Ronald D. Stoynoff, because he expects profitability to improve at the software maker.
