AEA Investors Inc., a New York investment firm, withdrew its $565 million offer to purchase two divisions of Kloster Cruise Ltd., Coral Gables, Fla.
AEA said the acquisitions wouldn't fit with its investment goals "within the financial framework proposed for the transaction."
In December, AEA said it signed a preliminary agreement to purchase Royal Viking Line and Royal Cruise Line, two of Kloster's units.
AEA hadn't yet done due diligence on the transaction.
Kloster is owned by the Oslocruise and ferry concern Vard AS.
While Kloster had said the sales would allow the company to reduce debt and modernize other lines, it said yesterday that earnings will be helped by the retention of the divisions because bookings are stronger than those from prior years.
