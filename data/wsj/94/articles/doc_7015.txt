Southern Union Co. said it paid about $400 million to acquire natural gas properties and operations from Western Resources Inc.
Southern Union's purchase of the properties and operations in western and central Missouri was first announced in July 1993.
With the acquisition, Southern Union, a natural-gas distribution company based in Austin, Texas, gained approximately 460,000 customers, nearly doubling its customer base.
The company said it funded the acquisition through a recent common stock offering and sale of senior notes.
Western Resources, a Kansas City, Mo., utility, said it would use the proceeds to lower long-term and short-term debt.
