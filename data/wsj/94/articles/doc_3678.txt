Another venerable corporate name belongs to the ages: American Telephone & Telegraph Co. wants to be just plain AT&T Corp.
The company, of course, has an unsentimental explanation for wanting to change its name.
It's more practical.
And most people know the telecommunications giant by its initials.
"It's the perfect time, being that it's 10 years since our breakup and telephone and telegraph doesn't describe the company we are today," says Marilyn Laurie, AT&T's senior vice president of public relations.
AT&T's own survey showed that 58% of people over 18 years old don't even know what the letters stand for.
What they used to stand for was a name that symbolized a bygone American era, when unpretentious people with names like Bell and Edison could invent things that became the foundations for corporate empires.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. became the biggest of them all: When it was broken up in 1984, AT&T was the world's largest company with more than a million employees, revenues that topped $100 billion and what is still widely regarded as the world's premiere research and development organization.
