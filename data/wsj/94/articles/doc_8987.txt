ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG, the Swedish-Swiss heavy-engineering group, said it received an order valued at more than $100 million for a combined heating and power plant complex at Gera, near Leipzig in eastern Germany.
The order, from Kraftwerke Gera GmbH, represents the seventh from eastern Germany for ABB to build or refurbish power plants, the company said.
"The contract covers the planning of a combined heating and power plant at Gera North, and two additional plants -- one for Gera Central and the other for Gera South," ABB said.
The company said the contract also includes an option to go ahead with construction of the three plants, which are scheduled to begin operation by mid-1996.
ABB Asea Brown Boveri is owned jointly by Asea AB of Sweden and BBC Brown Boveri AG of Switzerland.
