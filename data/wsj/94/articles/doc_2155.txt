Nervous investors knocked bond prices lower ahead of today's inflation report.
Stocks edged higher, and the dollar rose.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.28 point to 3862.98.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.95 to 467.39, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 3.60 to 792.80.
Analysts said the mood in the ravaged bond market remains grim.
Walter C. Revis, market analyst at Hamilton Investments in Chicago, said bond prices finished their sixth-straight losing week on Friday and that pessimism is at its worst level since October 1987.
With such a backdrop, bond traders were extremely cautious before today's report on February producer prices.
Adding to anxieties is tomorrow's release of February consumer price index.
However, Mr. Revis said good inflation news could set off a bond rally simply because the gloom is so pervasive.
Stock prices were buoyed by strength in overseas markets and an easing of U.S.-Japanese trade tensions, analysts said.
"Stocks seem to be able to make some headway as long as bonds are not falling dramatically," Mr. Revis said.
Overseas, European stocks surged on brighter prospects for further interest-rate cuts in Germany and elsewhere.
Hopes improved after a wage settlement for Germany's public-sector unions came in below the inflation rate.
German shares surged 3.2%, French stocks 1.8% and British shares 1.3%.
But the European stock market rally "isn't just an interest-rate story," said Warren Oliver, a European economist at S.G. Warburg in London.
He said signs of economic growth in Europe also are fueling the stock markets.
In Asia, Japanese shares rose 2% amid easing of trade tensions with the U.S.
World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.43 to 115.90.
Stock prices rose.
Volume totaled 260,139,000 shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,159 issues rose and 949 fell.
Bond prices fell.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue fell more than 1/2 point, or more than $5 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.95%.
The dollar rose.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.6900 marks and 106.10 yen compared with 1.6825 marks and 105.00 yen Friday.
