Germany's Thyssen Stahl AG reported "catastrophic" results for its year ended Sept. 30, but said it would return to profitability in two years.
The steel-making unit of German industrial group Thyssen AG reported a loss of 1.23 billion marks ($704.4 million), its largest ever and four times the previous year's loss.
"One can only describe the results as catastrophic," said Ekkehard Schulz, Thyssen Stahl's chairman.
The group adjusted fiscal 1992 results following the Oct. 1, 1992, merger of Thyssen Stahl and specialty-steel manufacturer Thyssen Edelstahl, placing the combined loss at 306 million marks ($175.2 million).
Sales in the recently ended year dropped 15% to 10.6 billion marks from a year-earlier adjusted 12.5 billion marks, reflecting both lower prices and lower volume sales, the unit said.
In the first three months of the current fiscal year, sales declined 7% from year-earlier figures, to 2.5 billion marks.
