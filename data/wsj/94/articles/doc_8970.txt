Japan's Nissan Motor Co. said it will continue to furlough workers at its domestic plants in the first half of the fiscal year starting April 1, and that it plans several temporary shutdowns in some or all of its five main plants in the current half.
A spokeswoman said that during the current half Nissan on seven days closed some or all of its four assembly plants and one engine plant.
She said the company plans to idle them again for two to five days in January and February.
The spokeswoman added that the number and effects of the furloughs in next fiscal year's first half will be similar to those in the current half.
Meanwhile at a news conference, Nissan President Yoshifumi Tsuji said that freezing workers' pay at this year's levels is "one of the options" for the company.
