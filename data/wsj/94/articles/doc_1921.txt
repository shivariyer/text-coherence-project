Reader's Digest Association Inc., the world-wide publishing company, named James P. Schadt, 55 years old, chief executive officer as of Aug. 1.
Mr. Schadt will retain the title of president.
He had also been chief operating officer at Reader's Digest, which he joined in 1991 after a career as a top executive at several consumer packaged goods companies.
He succeeds George V. Grune, who turns 65 in July, and has been chief executive for 10 years.
Mr. Grune will remain chairman, consulting with Mr. Schadt and the board on the company's global strategic plan.
The company doesn't have a mandatory retirement age.
Mr. Grune also will continue as chairman of the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund and the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, philanthropic organizations based in New York and established by the founders of Reader's Digest.
Though he had no background in publishing before joining Reader's Digest, Mr. Schadt was praised yesterday by Mr. Grune, who said his successor has "demonstrated a deep respect for our editorial heritage and a keen understanding of our direct mail marketing business."
Besides publishing U.S. and international editions of Reader's Digest magazine, the company, with annual revenue of $2.8 billion, also sells books, recorded music, and videocassettes through direct mail and retail channels.
The company also publishes special interest magazines, such as Travel Holiday and American Health.
Before coming to Reader's Digest, Mr. Schadt was with Cadbury Schweppes PLC for 10 years, serving as president and chief operating officer of its global beverage business.
Before that, he held senior posts at Sara Lee Corp. and PepsiCo, and began his career at Procter & Gamble as a brand manager.
READER'S DIGEST ASSOCIATION Inc. has a mandatory retirement age of 65 for its senior-level executives.
Based on erroneous information supplied by the company, a Who's News article yesterday said the company doesn't have a mandatory retirement age.
