Southdown Inc. said it expects to report that it broke even in the fourth quarter before one-time charges totaling about $4 million.
The Houston-based cement and concrete company said that after providing for the payment of preferred stock dividends, the company would report a loss of five to 10 cents a share before the charges.
For 1992's fourth quarter, Southdown had a loss of $26.5 million, or $1.64 a share, after a $21.4 million charge related to the write-down of the company's environmental-services assets.
Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Southdown closed at $24.875, up $1.125, or 4.7%, on volume of 251,700 shares.
