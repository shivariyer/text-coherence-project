Edward Waitzer, chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission, said he has commissioned a review of the regulations governing mutual-fund sales in the province.
Mr. Waitzer said OSC Commissioner Glorianne Stromberg will try to identify any problems that affect the investment-fund industry and mutual-fund investors, and what remedies might be required.
He said the last major review of mutual-fund regulations was in 1969.
"This is an industry whose dramatic growth has caused it to outstrip its regulatory framework," Mr. Waitzer said.
He said he doesn't have any "preconceived ideas" as to what Ms. Stromberg may identify as problems or recommendations.
But he voiced concern about the expectations placed on institutional investors with respect to corporate governance, about the level of knowledge and sophistication among mutual-fund investors as well the possible future role of self-regulatory organizations in monitoring the future development of the mutual-fund industry.
One question likely to be a subject of the review is whether the Investment Funds Institute of Canada, an industry association, could develop into a full-fledged self-regulatory organization, he said.
Mr. Waitzer said he expects Ms. Stromberg to report back to the commission before the end of the summer.
