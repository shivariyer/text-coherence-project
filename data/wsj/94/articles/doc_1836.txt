Trustees of a Grumman Corp. employee stock plan, which owns one-third of Grumman's stock, hired an investment banker and law firm to help consider two competing takeover bids for the aircraft maker.
The three trustees hired the investment firm of Rothschild Inc. and the law firm of Whitman Breed Abbott & Morgan to evaluate the bids by Martin Marietta Corp. and Northrop Corp.
The trustees, who are all Grumman executives, are important to the takeover battle because they have the right to decide how to tender the stock in the plan.
They may also decide to "pass through" that decision to each participant in the plan.
