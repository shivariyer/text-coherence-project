RadioMail Corp., a closely held wireless communications concern, said Dell Computer Corp. will include RadioMail electronic messaging software in Dell's new line of portable computers.
The move is a boost for RadioMail, which pioneered development of software connections between wireless and wired e-mail systems.
The company is trying to stay ahead of larger concerns planning to get into this gateway business, such as American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
Based in San Mateo, Calif., RadioMail, part-owned by Motorola Corp., didn't disclose any estimates for revenue or profit from the link with Dell.
The company said Dell, in Austin, Texas, agreed to provide RadioMail software in the standard software package that comes with Dell's Latitude portable computers.
In order to tie into RadioMail's network, users will still have to buy a modem and pay a monthly subscription fee of $89.
