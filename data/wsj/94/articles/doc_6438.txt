Ryder System Inc. expects to report an almost 40% jump in fourth-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, M. Anthony Burns, chairman and chief executive officer, said.
The recent quarter's performance will be compared with a 1992 fourth quarter in which the highway transportation concern posted net income of 28 cents a share from continuing operations, Mr. Burns said in an interview.
For all of 1993, Mr. Burns said Ryder would report a 20% increase in per-share earnings from continuing operations.
In 1992, the Miami-based company's continuing operations earned about $98 million, or $1.17 a share, on revenue of $4 billion, he said.
Other numbers, such as total earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarters of 1992 and 1993, weren't available.
The figures cited by Mr. Burns exclude Ryder's large aviation division, which in December was spun off into a publicly traded company called Aviall Inc.
The Aviall spinoff was the latest and largest step in a four-year restructuring program aimed at refocusing Ryder on its core business of truck leasing, truck renting, auto hauling and other trucking services.
"We've now completed our transition," Mr. Burns said.
Ryder expects to report that its 1993 revenue from continuing operations grew to $4.2 billion from $4 billion in 1992.
For the fourth quarter, revenue from continuing operations increased to approximately $1.1 billion from $1 billion in the year-earlier period, Mr. Burns added.
When Ryder reports its 1993 financial results, expected this week, the Aviall division's financial results for most of the year will be included.
As a result, Ryder plans to report an overall loss for the year, due primarily to a $169.4 million charge relating to the Aviall spinoff.
In 1992, including all operations, Ryder posted earnings of $124 million, or $1.51 a share, on revenue of $5.2 billion.
During the fourth quarter of 1992, Ryder reported earnings of $29.8 million, or 36 cents a share, on revenue of $1.3 billion, including all operations.
Mr. Burns attributed the continuing operations gains at Ryder largely to the improved performance of the company's large vehicle-leasing and services division, where earnings for the quarter are expected to rise 50% from the year-earlier period.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, the division reported pretax earnings of $31 million on revenue of $868 million.
