Swedish industrial group Trelleborg AB, active in metals, mining, building materials and rubber, sold its 20% stake in Phoenix AG, a German rubber company.
Trelleborg put the market value of the 300,000 Phoenix shares placed with institutional investors at roughly 80 million marks ($47 million).
The move is "entirely in line with our strategy of reducing net indebtedness and creating room for ventures within wholly owned core operations," said Kjell Nilsson, president.
He said the depreciation of the Swedish krona had given the group "many exciting possibilities" for expansion in Sweden.
The technical and commercial cooperation agreement between Trelleborg and Phoenix dating to 1991 has been extended until 1996.
Fredrik Arp, head of Trelleborg Industrier, the group's rubber unit, said, "We see good chances for deepening cooperation even without part ownership."
