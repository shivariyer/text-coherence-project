Rep. Butler Derrick (D., S.C.), the highest-ranking Southerner in the House Democratic leadership, announced he won't seek re-election.
Mr. Derrick, 57, joined a growing exodus from Capitol Hill spawned in recent years by persistent public discontent with Congress.
Some 36 House members have said they won't seek re-election this fall, though 15 of them are seeking other elective offices.
Elected in the Watergate class of 1974, Mr. Derrick has been an important emissary to his party's restive Southern wing in his role as a top lieutenant to Democratic Whip David Bonior.
He has been in line to succeed Rep. Joseph Moakley (D., Mass.) as chairman of the powerful Rules Committee.
But Mr. Derrick's moderate views and loyalty to the leadership -- he helped round up votes for Mr. Clinton's tax-raising economic program, for example -- ensured that he was continually vulnerable to challenge.
Mr. Derrick didn't announce future plans.
