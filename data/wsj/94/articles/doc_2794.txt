UNION CAMP Corp. of Wayne, N.J., said it anticipates raising about $100 million from a public stock offering of a minority interest in its wholly owned Bush Boake Allen subsidiary.
Bush Boake Allen produces flavors, fragrances and aroma chemicals with annual sales of about $350 million.
Union Camp had announced plans to take the unit public in December.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it would sell about 30% of the common stock, or 5.6 million shares, at an anticipated price of $17 to $19 a share.
Mark Diverio, an analyst with UBS Securities, called the unit "a hidden success story which tends to get lost" next to Union Camp's paper businesses.
The unit has 11% to 12% operating profit margins compared with overall company operating margins of about 8%, he said.
Union Camp has annual sales of about $3.12 billion.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Union Camp shares declined 75 cents, to $47.875.
