Japan Airlines, the largest airline in Japan, is considering buying smaller airplanes for use in domestic airline routes in an attempt to grab a bigger market share in Japan.
A spokesman said JAL intends to buy smaller airplanes with 100 to 200 seats to improve profitability on domestic routes where demand isn't so strong.
However, the spokesman said such details as what type of aircraft, when the aircraft will be introduced and the total purchasing costs haven't been decided.
Currently, JAL operates three types of aircraft on 31 domestic routes: Boeing 747s which have 568 seats each; DC-10s, with 318 seats; and Boeing 767s, with 270 seats.
International flights account for 70% of JAL's revenue, but plans depend on increasing domestic operations to 40% from the current 30% to offset losses due to currency movements.
At the same time, the company is planning to expand domestic market share to 33% from the current 22%.
