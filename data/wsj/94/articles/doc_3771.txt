A consortium consisting of Telefonica de Espana S.A. and three Peruvian companies agreed to purchase a controlling stake in the state-operated Peruvian telephone system for $2 billion.
The hefty purchase price, which was nearly four times the minimum bid set by the government and 2.5 times the bids tendered by two competing consortia, reflects Peru's improving economic and political conditions.
The package purchased by the Telefonica group consists of a 35% controlling interest in the government's wholly owned Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones del Peru, or Entel, and a 20% controlling interest in its Cia Peruana de Telefonos.
Entel provides long-distance phone service for the entire country as well as local service outside the capital of Lima.
CPT, which provides local phone service to Lima, also has a cable television license.
Along with Madrid-based Telefonica, the winning group included Cerveceria Backus & Johnston S.A., Peru's largest beer maker; Banco Wiese Ltd., the country's second-largest bank; and Grana y Montero S.A., a Peruvian construction firm.
The bid by the Telefonica de Espana group far surpassed offers by two competing groups led by GTE Corp., of Stamford, Conn., and Southwestern Bell Corp., of San Antonio.
