The board of LWT Holdings PLC, a British television concern, urged shareholders to reject the final hostile takeover offer of leisure concern Granada Group PLC as too low.
LWT also again questioned Granada's motives, a frequent defense during the two-month battle.
"Granada needs to buy LWT's earnings to offset the long-term decline in its television rental business," it said.
Granada is offering 13 new Granada shares for every 10 LWT shares, plus a small amount of cash, valuing the target at #776 million ($1.13 billion).
