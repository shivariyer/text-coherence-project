Are Texans starting to wean themselves from light beers?
If sales of Shiner Bock are any clue, they just might be.
Sales of the dark, heavy beer rose about 50% in 1993, says Spoetzl Brewery owner Carlos Alvarez.
His 84-year-old brewery, in Shiner, sold a record 73,000 barrels last year, or more than one million cases, most of it in Texas and most of it Shiner Bock.
"Specialty beers are growing in Texas," Mr. Alvarez says.
But Texans have a long way to go before they drink as much specialty beer -- anything but a typical American lager -- as other Americans.
Specialty beers account for less than 0.2% of beer sold in Texas; nationwide, they approach 1% of the market, says Frank Walters, research director at Impact, a New York beverage publication.
Light beers hog more of the market in Texas than any other state, perhaps because of the heat.
One of every two beers imbibed by Texans is a light brew, vs. 40% of the national market.
The No. 1 beer in Texas is Miller Lite; elsewhere, it's Budweiser.
Shiner's biggest rivals in the Texas specialty-beer market are doing well, too, though their numbers are small.
In-state sales of Killian's Irish Red, from Coors Brewing Co. of Golden, Colo., rose about 50% in 1993 to 4,000 barrels, while sales of Samuel Adams, from Boston Beer Co. of Boston, nearly tripled to 13,000 barrels, Mr. Walters says.
Other big gainers included two California beers: Anchor Steam, up 13% to 526 barrels; and Sierra Nevada, which entered the Texas market in 1993 and sold 150 barrels.
Those numbers are tiny compared with Miller Lite's three million Texas barrels.
But there's hope for marketers of full-calorie beers: Miller Lite's Texas sales fell 6% last year, showing the same weakness as elsewhere.
And Mr. Alvarez thinks the introduction of "brewpubs" -- brewery-restaurant combinations approved by the Legislature last year -- will further help pull Texans away from light beer.
"It's going to increase the education on different styles of beer," he says.
