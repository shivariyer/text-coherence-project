Taiwan's industrial production index for February declined to 92.30, off 8.1% from a year earlier, and down 16.4% from January, the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported.
The ministry attributed the index's year-to-year fall to seasonal factors, citing fewer working days in February because of Chinese New Year holidays.
The ministry said the index for the first two months of 1994 showed an increase of 6.3% from the year-earlier period.
