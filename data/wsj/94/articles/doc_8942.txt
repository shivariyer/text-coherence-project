I.C.H. Corp., in another restructuring move, said two companies agreed to purchase major chunks of its common stock from its controlling shareholder.
Stephens Inc., a Little Rock, Ark., investment bank, will buy 4.5 million shares, or about 9% of the shares outstanding, and Torchmark Corp., a Birmingham, Ala., insurance company, will purchase about 4.7 million shares, or nearly 10%, from Consolidated National Corp.
The two will pay $5 a share.
Consolidated is an insurance holding company controlled by Robert T. Shaw, I.C.H.'s former chairman and chief executive officer.
A spokesman for I.C.H., Louisville, Ky., said the actions are part of I.C.H.'s restructuring, which includes cutting debt and bolstering the balance sheet.
They also stem from Mr. Shaw's desire to reduce his ties to I.C.H., he said.
Consolidated will still own one million common shares, or about 2% of the shares outstanding, and 541,000 shares of Series 1984 Class A preferred stock.
