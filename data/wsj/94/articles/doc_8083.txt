Eugene Scalia should weigh the costs of doing nothing about cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) before he objects to ergonomics programs ("OSHA to Business: Slow Down, You Work Too Fast," editorial page, Jan. 13).
By the most conservative estimates made a decade ago, CTDs of the hand and arm cost at least $20 billion a year in health care, workers compensation, disability and lost work-time costs.
The real current figure surely is at least several times that amount.
Ergonomic programs, which researchers have found effective at reducing the rate of reported ailments, cost far less.
Whether CTDs are real health conditions (as I believe) or the collective fantasy of tens of millions of men and women in diverse industries (as Mr. Scalia suggests), businesses -- certainly those in high-risk industries such as meat cutting and data processing -- should be wary of lawyers like Mr. Scalia who advise them to opt for policies that are expensive and nonproductive.
