Santa Fe Pacific Corp. said fourth-quarter net income fell 60%, because year-earlier earnings included a $204.9 million gain from sale of rail lines.
Net for the quarter was $67 million, or 36 cents a share, down from $168.9 million, or 91 cents a share.
Operating profit rose 32%, to $143.5 million from $108.6 million.
Revenue rose 16% to $732.6 million.
The Schaumburg, Ill., transportation, energy and mining company said results were boosted by record operating profit at its railway unit, higher profit at its goldmining unit and lower interest expense.
For the year, net rose to $338.8 million, or $1.81 a share, against a loss of $104.5 million, or 57 cents a share, in 1992.
The 1993 earnings include a nonrecurring pretax gain of $362.9 million.
The year-earlier results include a one-time charge of $320.4 million for centralizing operations and increased environmental accruals and a charge of $163 million for retiree and inactive-employee benefits.
