First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, said the federal government renewed a contract under which government employees are issued Visa cards to make job-related purchases.
The bank-holding company's Rocky Mountain BankCard System and Colorado National Bank subsidiaries have been administering the program for the General Services Administration since the government implemented it in 1989.
Currently, about 65,000 government employees hold such "purchasing cards," which are used to make routine, small purchases.
Such cards streamline the procurement process -- eliminating paperwork associated with taking out an advance, then being reimbursed, for example -- and make it easier for the government to track maintenance, repair and routine operating outlays.
First Bank said it processed about $535 million in government purchases last year.
