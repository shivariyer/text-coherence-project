DEVELOPERS DIVERSIFIED REALTY Corp., Cleveland, said its board plans to increase the 1994 annual dividend by 20% to $1.92 a share, or 48 cents a share quarterly.
The company's most recent quarterly dividend was 40 cents a share, paid on Monday.
The real-estate investment trust said the planned increase reflects the "dynamic growth" that it has experienced since it went public last February.
