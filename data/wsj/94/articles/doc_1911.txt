Determining that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. paid too much to purchase Canadian natural gas in the late 1980s, California's Public Utilities Commission ordered the utility to refund $115 million to its customers.
The dispute involves a PG&E subsidiary's gas purchases from Canadian producers from 1988 to 1990 under fixed, long-term contracts rather than on the "spot" market, where prices generally were lower.
The company contends the arrangement was necessary to ensure adequate supply, arguing that it still paid less than the prices charged by U.S. producers.
The San Francisco-based utility has strongly objected to any refunds.
A spokesman said it is leaning toward seeking reconsideration of yesterday's decision.
An additional $160 million in gas purchases in later years is under review by the commission.
