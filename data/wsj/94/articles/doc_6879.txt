Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. said it will raise by 3% the prices of all Bridgestone and Firestone passenger, light truck, medium and heavy truck, agricultural and forestry tires in the U.S. replacement market.
The boost takes effect April 1.
The Nashville, Tenn., company cited "the escalation in raw material costs, including both natural and synthetic rubber."
The move follows similar price increases in recent weeks by rivals.
Bridgestone/Firestone is a unit of Bridgestone Corp. of Japan.
Last month, Bridgestone/Firestone's Dayton Tire Co. unit announced a 3% to 5% price increase on its Dayton and Road King lines as well as private-label lines, and an average 3% price increase on its Seiberling tires, effective March 1.
