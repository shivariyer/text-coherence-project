Pharmacia AB, a Swedish pharmaceutical group, said Tuesday that it plans to sell its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary Pharmacia Deltec Inc.
The Deltec subsidiary, based in St. Paul, Minn., develops and manufacturers drug-delivery systems.
Annual sales of the subsidiary, which has a staff of 600, are about $100 million.
Pharmacia said it retained Lehman Brothers as financial adviser in the sale.
