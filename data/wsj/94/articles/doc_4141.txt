Thousands of peasant farmers staged demonstrations in the northern border state of Chihuahua yesterday, showing just how far the spirit of rebellion has spread from Mexico's southernmost state of Chiapas.
The demonstrators said they are angry because banks have started repossessing property and have cut off credit to farmers, who, like their counterparts world-wide, are suffering from low prices.
In an attempt to pressure the federal government into forcing the banks to resume lending, the demonstrators occupied two big banks in the capital of Chihuahua, keeping people from entering and shouting at bank officers.
The demonstrators said they plan further actions today.
The protesters linked their actions partly to events in Chiapas, showing just how much the negotiating table in that state has become the focus for those pushing for political and social reform.
In a closed political system such as Mexico's, it is rare for representatives of the government to sit down and negotiate, so groups around the country have been rushing to take advantage of the government's willingness to bargain with the Chiapas rebels.
Some groups have even asked Chiapas Bishop Samuel Ruiz, a mediator in the peace talks, to negotiate on their behalf with the government.
Meanwhile, in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexican government peace envoy Manuel Camacho Solis raised hopes when he said the problems in Chiapas called for increased democracy, seeming to suggest he is prepared to offer rebels more than local palliatives.
It's not clear just how broad a mandate Mr. Camacho has been given by President Carlos Salinas.
Mr. Camacho, passed over as the ruling party's choice for the presidential elections this August, may be pursuing his own liberal political agenda.
There are still many hard-liners in senior government positions who will resist any attempts to open the political system or to let a small group of rebels influence governmental decisions.
