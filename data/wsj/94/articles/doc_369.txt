Deltona Corp. said it is unable to pay many of its operating expenses and is considering, among other things, the possibility of filing for reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws.
The Miami-based developer of planned communities also said it plans to reduce its staff by over half, to 48 people.
The company added that it is not likely to release its 1993 fourth-quarter earnings report, year-end results or annual report "on a timely basis."
The company has not set a date for its annual shareholders meeting.
Deltona and its controlling shareholders, Selex International BV and Yasawa Holding NV, have held preliminary talks with several parties who may be interested in buying the positions of Selex and Yasawa and providing financing.
This month, the company said it was in default on payment obligations to a Division of Florida Land Sales escrow fund, to its corporate-office landlord, and to lenders such as Selex.
Deltona has been troubled in recent years by a class-action lawsuit, from residents who said they paid for land they never received, failed marketing initiatives and financing problems.
