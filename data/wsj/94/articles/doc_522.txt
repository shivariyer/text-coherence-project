In a move to expand its home-lending business, BankAmerica Corp. said it is acquiring United Mortgage Holding Co., a midsize mortgage banker in the Midwest.
BankAmerica said its banking unit, Bank of America, will acquire all the stock outstanding of closely held United, based in Bloomington, Minn.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Officials at San Francisco-based BankAmerica said the acquisition, expected to close in the third quarter after regulatory approvals, would broaden the bank's reach in making home loans beyond its current focus in 10 Western states to the Midwest.
United originated $1.9 billion in home loans last year, largely in Midwestern states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota.
BankAmerica said it originated $10.6 billion in home loans in 1993.
