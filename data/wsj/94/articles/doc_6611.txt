The Federal government is considering making antilock brakes mandatory, but the auto industry says no mandate is needed because consumers are demanding the sophisticated brakes.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking for public comment on a possible rule that would require antilock brakes on all cars and trucks.
The request for comment by March 7 starts a lengthy rule-making and review process.
"We're not sure it should be mandated since we're doing it anyway," said Robert Munson, executive director of automotive safety and engineering standards at Ford Motor Co.
About 42% of U.S.-built cars were sold with antilock brakes in the 1993 model year, up from 32% the previous year, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade journal.
Most vehicles sold in the U.S. have antilock brakes either standard or available as an option.
The agency's move toward increasing antilock brake use comes only a week after an insurance group released a study showing that antilock brakes don't do much to reduce claims in accidents.
Most consumers like the added control the brakes give on ice.
According to Ford, 90% of consumers with antilock brakes and 70% of those without antilock brakes would like the equipment on their next vehicle.
They add about $565 to the cost of a Ford Taurus.
