Eaton Corp. reported a 33% drop in fourth-quarter profit due to a restructuring charge related to its $1.1 billion acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s distribution and control business.
Net income was $26 million, or 36 cents a share, down from $39 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier.
The latest quarter included a charge of $55 million, calculated before income tax credits, for costs related to the acquisition of Westinghouse's distribution and control business.
Eaton closed that transaction on Monday, and also said it sold some of acquired Westinghouse assets to Thomas & Betts Corp. to satisfy federal antitrust concerns.
On an operating basis, however, Eaton earned $64 million, or 90 cents a share, mainly reflecting strong results in the company's vehicles components business, which includes the manufacture of transmission systems, suspensions and brakes.
The latest quarter's net income also included the effect of a $4 million charge related to a debenture redemption.
Cleveland-based Eaton said sales rose to $1.12 billion from $1.03 billion.
