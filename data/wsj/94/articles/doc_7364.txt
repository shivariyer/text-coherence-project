Spain's state-run banking group Argentaria Corp.
Bancaria de Espana said its consolidated net income rose 15% in 1993 to 64.84 billion pesetas ($464.3 million) from 56.17 billion pesetas in 1992.
Argentaria also said it plans to pay a total gross dividend on its 1993 account of 250 pesetas, within the bank's forecast range of 230 pesetas to 260 pesetas.
Argentaria will pay a gross final dividend of 135 pesetas after receiving shareholder approval at the annual general meeting.
It paid a gross interim dividend of 115 pesetas in October 1993.
The 1993 dividend is the first paid to private shareholders by Argentaria, which made its debut on the Madrid stock market last May after the government placed a 25% stake among institutional investors, individual investors and employees.
In November, the bank floated an additional 25%.
Argentaria's provisions for nonperforming loans declined 4.8% in 1993 to 94.09 billion pesetas from 98.80 billion pesetas in 1992.
The bank's loan-loss coverage rate rose to 76% from 67% in 1992.
Total provisions, including those for investment-risk coverage, were up 17% to 111.02 billion pesetas from 94.59 billion pesetas in 1992.
Argentaria said its operating profit in 1993 rose 18.9% to 144.29 billion pesetas from 121.32 billion pesetas in 1992.
Operating expenses were contained in 1993, dipping 0.5% to 166.07 billion pesetas from 166.90 billion pesetas.
Personnel expenses edged up 3.3% to 102.99 billion pesetas from 99.73 billion pesetas, while general expenses declined 5.6% to 48.12 billion pesetas from 50.99 billion pesetas.
The group's noninterest income, mostly from commissions and fees, jumped 17% to 54.17 billion pesetas from 46.19 billion pesetas.
The bank said strengthened fund management, credit-card services, capital and stock markets, insurance and foreign-currency activity were behind the large rise in noninterest income.
Average total assets climbed 7.9% to 10.25 trillion pesetas ($73.4 billion) in 1993, while average equity increased 8.9% to 572.23 billion pesetas.

The bank's loan portfolio remained practically stable, easing 0.8% to 6.20 trillion pesetas.
But customer funds grew 15% to 5.10 trillion pesetas, including 14% growth in deposits to 3.90 trillion pesetas.
