Japanese trading house Nichimen Corp. and Mitsui group company Mitsui Matsushima Co. will invest in an Indonesian coal-mining project that is expected to start producing in 1996, spokesmen for both companies said.
The two Japanese concerns will invest in the project via Indonesian coal development firm PT Riau Baraharum, which is conducting a feasibility study on the field.
That study is expected to be finished by the end of 1994.
The project is expected to be producing at a capacity of about one million tons a year by 1997.
The two concerns will together provide Riau with about $1.5 million for exploration costs and about $15 million for development activities.
