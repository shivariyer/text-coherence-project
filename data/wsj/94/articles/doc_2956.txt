Three members of Lehman Brothers Inc.'s research staff, including chief equity economist Robert Barbera, have left the firm, a spokeswoman for Lehman said.
Besides Mr. Barbera, analysts Jennifer Coury, who covers beverages, and Kenneth Miller, who follows oil services and equipment, also have left the American Express Co. unit.
As with similar personnel maneuvers on Wall Street, the Lehman moves follow the payment of 1993 bonuses last week.
The firm expects to hire two to three analysts within a month, the spokeswoman said.
Mr. Barbera's resignation is effective immediately.
Late last year, Allen Sinai, Lehman's chief economist, returned to the firm.
In an internal memo, Lehman's director of research, Fred Fraenkel, said Mr. Barbera's decision to leave "stems from his desire to pursue other business and personal opportunities."
Mr. Barbera's association with the firm stretches back to 1982, when he worked for E.F. Hutton.
Hutton was acquired by Shearson Lehman Brothers in 1987.
Ms. Coury, a runner-up in Institutional Investor magazine's 1993 All-America research team, left to take time off from the industry.
She won't be replaced, and her stocks will be reassigned within the firm.
Mr. Miller left to join an oil-services boutique in Houston.
He will be replaced internally, the spokeswoman said.
News of the Lehman departures was first reported in Wall Street Letter, a trade newsletter.
