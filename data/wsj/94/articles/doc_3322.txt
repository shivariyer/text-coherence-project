Coastal Corp. appointed David A. Arledge president, a post that had gone unfilled since July 1993.
Mr. Arledge, 49 years old, had been Coastal's chief operating officer and a senior vice president since last year, and had widely been seen as the executive next in line for the president's job.
He succeeds James R. Paul, who the company said resigned "to pursue other interests."
Mr. Arledge will remain Coastal's chief operating officer.
But the huge energy holding company still will be led primarily by its outspoken founder and chairman, Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., who took back the title of chief executive last year after Mr. Paul's departure.
Coastal, a pipeline and refining company, has been better at the former than at the latter.
Recently, it has been restructuring its refining operations, including closing several plants and upgrading the system's ability to produce higher-margin petroleum products.
The company's efforts appear to have borne fruit; last year, it had net income of $115.8 million, or $1 a share, on revenue of $10.14 billion.
In 1992, Coastal had a net loss of $126.8 million, or $1.23 a share, on revenue of $10.06 billion; the 1992 results include a pretax restucturing charge of $125 million.
In related moves, Coastal said it promoted Sam F. Willson Jr., 64, to executive vice president from senior vice president, crude oil supply and marketing; Treasurer Jeffrey A. Connelly, 47, to senior vice president from vice president; and Controller Coby C. Hesse, 46, to senior vice president from vice president.
