Designatronics Inc. said it set up a division to market components made by Japan's Kohara Gear Co.
Designatronics also said it expects higher fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings from continuing operations.
Designatronics, based in New Hyde Park, N.Y., makes small mechanical, electromechanical and automation components.
It said in a meeting with analysts that its new Quality Transmission Components division will market larger components from Kohara.
Martin Hoffman, Designatronics' chief executive, said he expects an earnings increase of at least 10% from continuing operations for the fiscal second quarter ending Feb. 28.
The company had earnings of $259,000 from continuing operations on sales of $5.7 million a year earlier.
