Separately, members of the United Transportation Union, which represents 7,100 Union Pacific employees, went on strike systemwide at 2 p.m.
Central Standard Time yesterday in a dispute over use of company cars to transport rail crews.
The company confirmed that rail operations were halted in a number of locations, but said it has asked a federal district court in Omaha, Neb., for a temporary restraining order to halt the work stoppage.
The number of employees who went on strike represent about a quarter of Union Pacific's railroad work force.
The union said the company has been requiring train crews that have ended their shift to drive company cars to get to their own vehicles, which can be a lengthy trip in some large railway yards.
