British Telecommunications PLC said pretax profit for the third quarter ended Dec. 31 declined 0.1% to #698 million ($1.02 billion) from 705 million a year earlier.
The figures exclude #142 million of redundancy charges in the latest quarter, compared with #17 million a year earlier.
BT said it expects further "significant redundancy costs" in the fourth quarter.
This week, BT cut telephone charges by eliminating higher rates for peak periods.
Sir Ian Vallance, chairman, said yesterday there would be more price cuts on the way due to competition, and that costs would have to be further controlled.
