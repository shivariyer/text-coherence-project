The London Stock Exchange selected John Kemp-Welch as its next chairman, hoping to end a period of uncertainty that began last spring when its computerized settlement-system project collapsed.
Mr. Kemp-Welch, 57 years old, currently senior partner at stockbrokers Cazenove & Co., will take over July 14 from the exchange's current chairman, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, 63, who is retiring.
Mr. Kemp-Welch has served as a director of the exchange since 1991.
He began his career with Hoare & Co. in 1954, moving to Cazenove & Co. in 1959, where he has been ever since.
Sir Andrew also has been acting chief executive since former chief executive Peter Rawlins resigned March 11, after the exchange pulled the plug on a 350 million ($520 million) decade-long project to create an automated settlement system called Taurus.
Most of the work was unsalvageable, and the exchange posted a pretax loss of 11.9 million for the year ended in March, compared with a year-earlier pretax profit of 1.5 million.
The exchange last fall appointed Michael Lawrence as chief executive, effective Feb. 1, amid hopes he would spur the bourse's modernization efforts.
Mr. Lawrence, 53, is finance director of Prudential Corp., Britain's largest insurer.
Following the Taurus debacle, the Bank of England took over primary responsibility for the creation of a replacement for the settlement system.
Before the new settlement system, dubbed Crest, begins functioning, the exchange plans to move in July to a 10-day "rolling" settlement.
This change is considered a major improvement from the current 14-day account period.
Under the new system, trades will be settled continually, albeit with a 10-day delay, instead of being grouped together and settled every 14 days.
