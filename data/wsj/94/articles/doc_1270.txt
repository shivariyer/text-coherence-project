Motorola Inc. said it won a contract valued at more than $100 million to provide a digital communications system to the Beijing municipal government.
The system is intended to be used for telephone service initially in the Chinese capital, but can be expanded to accommodate two-way radio calls and paging.
It's scheduled to be in operation by the first quarter of 1995.
