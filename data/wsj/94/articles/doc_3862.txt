Tyco Toys Inc., Mt. Laurel, N.J., said it will lay off 51 employees, or 5% of its U.S. work force, as part of a continuing move to reverse a series of losses.
The cuts, the company's first in a decade, won't require a special charge, said Jill Krutick, toy analyst for Salomon Bros.
But the announcement is ill-timed, coming on the heels of "a very upbeat" preview of its 1994 toy introductions at a Toy convention in New York two weeks ago, she said.
The toy maker, which hasn't come up with a hot-selling toy in recent months, is set to embark on one of its biggest product launches this year.
The company said it will lay off 34 employees at its New Jersey headquarters and 17 at its operations in the Portland, Ore., area.
Tyco said the staff cut will reduce its fixed cost structure and will "increase operating efficiencies and improve performance throughout the company."
In January Tyco announced a $26 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 1993, closing its Italian subsidiary and shrinking its German subsidiary.
