Energy Ventures Inc. said its land drilling contract with the National Iranian Oil Co. has been terminated because of "organizational and financial difficulties" experienced by the customer.
Energy Ventures, a Houston oil-field service and equipment company, said it is in talks with its political-risk insurer and with Iranian Oil about payments due for work performed.
Energy Ventures said it expects to recover the $11 million of assets and receivables it has in Iran.
Separately, Energy Ventures said it has acquired closely held AWI Drilling & Workover Inc., an oil-field services company based in Belle Chasse, La., for $6.5 million and 430,000 common shares.
