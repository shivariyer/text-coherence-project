Continental Airlines said it will add 330 jobs to its crew base in the Piedmont Triad area of North Carolina on May 1.
The airline said pilots and flight attendants currently assigned to other locations will fill the positions and will work on the Boeing 737 and DC-9 aircraft that the company uses for its short-haul, no-meals Peanuts Flights.
The additional jobs increase the number of employees in the area to about 510, Continental said, compared with 23 a year ago.
