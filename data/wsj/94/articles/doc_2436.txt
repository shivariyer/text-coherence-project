Medical Care America Inc. said its shareholders tendered about 17.8 million shares at $26 a share under the company's Dutch auction stock buyback.
The Dallas-based operator of outpatient surgical centers said it will acquire 7.7 million of the shares, or about 43% of the amount tendered, for $200 million.
The company had originally offered to buy seven million shares.
In a Dutch auction, the buyer sets a price range, and holders give a price at which they are willing to sell.
In January, when announcing an agreement to sell its home-infusion unit to Caremark International Inc. for $175 million, Medical Care said it would use the proceeds for the buyback.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Medical Care's stock closed at $24 a share, down $1.
