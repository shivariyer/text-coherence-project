Oryx Energy Co. said it suspended its quarterly dividend and slashed capital spending this year by 20% because of the plunge in crude-oil prices.
The oil exploration and production company said it will cut spending to $370 million from the $460 million of expenditures last year.
Oryx said at least 70% of the outlays will be earmarked for development, rather than exploration projects.
Spending money on the development of oil reserves brings the company much-needed cash more swiftly than exploration.
Oryx has long-term debt of around $1.77 billion, and a high debt-to-capitalization level of around 70%, a spokesman said.
The company doesn't have any plans to change its debt level this year, he said.
In the first nine months of 1993, Oryx had a net loss of $48 million, or 54 cents a share, on revenue of $825 million.
The company had been paying a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share.
Oryx said the dividend suspension will save about $40 million a year, which it will funnel into its capital-spending projects.
Oryx shares fell 62.5 cents to close at $17.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Despite the reduced spending, Oryx said, it expects its petroleum production will rise this year because it brought several new fields on stream in the past 10 months and acquired a larger interest in a North Sea field.
