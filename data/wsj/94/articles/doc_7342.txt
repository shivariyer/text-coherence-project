Metall Mining Corp., seeking control of a large copper-and-gold deposit in Argentina, said it plans a takeover bid with an indicated value as high as $184 million for all the shares of International Musto Explorations Ltd.
But International Musto said it had received what it considered a superior proposal from another big mining company to form a joint venture to develop the mine.
It didn't identify the other mining company.
Metall is 51%-owned by Germany's financially troubled Metallgesellschaft AG, which has said it intends to sell its stake in the Canadian mining company as part of the parent company's financial restructuring.
The Lundin family of Geneva owns about 37% of International Musto, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Toronto-based Metall said it plans to offer 16.25 Canadian dollars ($12.26) a share for International Musto, on condition that at least 50.1% of the shares are tendered under its bid and that Musto doesn't agree to a joint venture, sale or other agreement that would relinquish control of the Bajo de la Alumbrera property in northwest Argentina.
It said the shares would be purchased for cash or convertible preferred shares of Metall.
On Friday, International Musto shares rose C$4.50 to close at C$16.25 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The mining-exploration company has about 15 million shares outstanding.
Musto said in November that it would cost about $550 million to develop the Alumbrera deposit, which it said has mineable reserves of 5.8 billion pounds of copper and 10 million ounces of gold.
The company said Friday that it had received four proposals to sell or jointly develop the deposit.
It said Metall's "wasn't the best" of these plans, and that it was negotiating a letter of intent with another company for a joint venture.
Musto added that it won't identify the other company until the letter has been signed and the partners have met with Argentine officials.
