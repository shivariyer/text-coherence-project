Anderson Exploration Ltd. said it agreed to sell 3.5 million common shares to a group of Canadian underwriters for 31 Canadian dollars ($23.63) a share.
The Calgary, Alberta, oil and gas producer said net proceeds of C$104.2 million, after expenses and underwriting fees, will be used to finance gas development projects and reduce bank debt.
The transaction would raise the number of Anderson shares outstanding to about 28.2 million from 24.7 million.
The shares closed yesterday at C$31, down 75 Canadian cents, in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Anderson's senior vice president and chief financial officer, David Scobie, said he expects the company to cut its long-term bank debt to between C$80 million and C$90 million by its Sept. 30 fiscal year end, from C$141.5 million currently.
