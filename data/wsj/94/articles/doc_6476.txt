Eastman Kodak Co. said it would resume business activity in South Africa, after an absence of about six years.
The Rochester, N.Y., photography company said it expects to employ 15 to 20 people in South Africa by midyear and will concentrate on marketing its consumer and professional products, including those in its photography, copier, motion-picture and health divisions.
A Kodak spokesman said the operations would most likely be based in Johannesburg.
Before Kodak left South Africa in 1987, its sales there totaled less than $100 million, less than 1% of its world-wide sales.
