General Motors Corp., worried about retaining executive talent after a four-year bonus drought, gave its 3,400 top executives substantial raises in base salary last year.
Separately, in its preliminary proxy statement, GM proposed that shareholders approve a doubling of the authorized number of common shares to two billion.
Although GM maintained that it doesn't plan to use the authorization for anything besides routine preference conversions and stock-option plans, such a move would clear the way for a new issue to pay for new-product development or to reduce the company's $22.3 billion pension liability.
GM currently has 718,652,709 common shares outstanding, with a further 17,825,000 shares reserved for the conversion of its Series A preference stock into common.
GM said the executive raises are part of a rethinking by the board of the No. 1 auto maker's compensation policies.
Under new guidelines adopted last year, the board also imposed stock-ownership guidelines for the company's 65 top executives.
Although the raises ranged from 11% for William E. Hoglund to 50% for G. Richard Wagoner Jr., both of whom are executive vice presidents, the total compensation of GM's top officers lagged far behind that of rival Chrysler Corp., which has become one of the world's most profitable auto makers.
John F. Smith Jr., GM president and chief executive officer, earned a salary of $1,375,000 for 1993, up 37.5% from the stated $1 million a year he was earning at the end of 1992.
(Mr. Smith, who was promoted to his current position in November 1992, actually received $748,000 in salary for 1992.)
In 1993, Mr. Smith also realized $45,305 through the exercise of stock options.
Last week, Chrysler disclosed that Chairman Robert J. Eaton was paid $9,259,786, including a $4,478,272 gain from the exercise of stock options, and other perquisites.
Ford Motor Co. is expected to release its proxy statement in early April.
In an explanation of its new compensation policy, GM's board said the executive raises are intended "to provide a more competitive level of fixed compensation which would . . . enable the company to retain critically skilled executive talent."
With the recent lack of bonuses, this has become a big concern.
At the same time, "to further underscore the importance of linking executive and stockholder interests," the board's compensation committee set a requirement that the top 65 executives hold GM common stocks with a minimum aggregate market value equivalent to the executive's annual salary.
Formal guidelines weren't set for the balance of the 3,400-member executive corps.
For Mr. Smith, chief executive, the requirement is to hold GM shares worth twice his annual salary, GM said.
The company said all five members of the president's council have already satisfied the requirement; a spokeswoman said a deadline hasn't been set for the other officers to comply.
Executive-compensation experts say setting a stock-ownership requirement has become a growing trend in American industry.
A survey of 642 companies by William H. Mercer Inc. found that guidelines for chief executive officers typically range from three to five times salary.
In the auto industry, Ford doesn't have such a requirement, and a Chrysler spokesman said that while a guideline for executives exists, it isn't a requirement.
GM said it issued stock options covering 25,000 to 120,000 GM common shares to different members of the president's council, all exercisable at a price of $33.88, the market value when the options were granted in January 1993.
Yesterday, GM shares closed at $59.625, down 25 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Smith was granted options to buy 120,000 GM shares.
