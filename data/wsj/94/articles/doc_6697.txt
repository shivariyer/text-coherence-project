Calgene Inc., Davis, Calif., said its fiscal 1994 loss will be larger than 1993's loss because of delays in getting Food and Drug Administration approval for its genetically engineered Flavr Savr tomato.
Calgene reported a loss of $25.6 million, or $1.13 a share, in the 1993 fiscal year ended June 30.
The biotech company said the FDA is still reviewing Flavr Savr, which is expected to last longer and taste better than conventional tomatoes.
Federal regulators have given no indication when they will clear the tomato to be sold, Calgene said.
The company, which expected to begin marketing Flavr Savr last fall, now says it doesn't anticipate being able to put it on the market until at least the second quarter of this calendar year.
Calgen officials declined to speculate on how much larger the loss will be for this fiscal year.
But they said the FDA holdup and premarketing costs are pushing up costs beyond previous estimates.
