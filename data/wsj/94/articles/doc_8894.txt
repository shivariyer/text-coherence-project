Ecogen Inc., a biological pest-control concern, said its marketing partner in Paris received permission to market two bioinsecticides in France.
The partner, Procida-Roussel Uclaf, received clearance for bacillus thuringiensis-based products known as Cutlass, which will be used to fight grape and vegetable crop pests under the name EcoTech Bio, and for Condor, to be sold as EcoTech Pro, as protection against pine tree caterpillars.
Procida is the marketing division of Roussel Uclaf SA.
