Coca-Cola Co., bolstered by solid volume growth in overseas markets, reported that its fourth-quarter earnings jumped 19%.
The beverage company said net income surged to $466 million, or 36 cents a share, on revenue of $3.37 billion.
That compares with earnings of $392 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier, on revenue of $3.24 billion.
The results, which slightly exceeded analysts' consensus estimates of 35 cents a share, demonstrated continued growth in developing markets, such as Eastern Europe and China, where volume, as measured by case sales, grew by 21% and 38% for the year, respectively.
Also, during the fourth quarter, Coca-Cola was able to improve on weak third-quarter performances in such key markets as Britain, Germany and Japan.
International business accounts for about 80% of the company's earnings.
After an 8% year-on-year decline in volume during the third quarter in Japan, for instance, Coke's fourth-quarter volume rose 3% from a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter volume in Britain hit 8%, after a 1% gain in the third quarter.
In Germany, fourth-quarter volume was even with the same period of 1992, compared with an 11% drop in the third quarter.
The company attributed the turnaround partly to improving economies in those countries.
"The key at Coke is the international side of the business," said George Thompson, senior analyst with Prudential Securities.
"We're seeing increasing evidence that the problem they've had is really cyclically oriented."
Overall, international volume grew 7% in the quarter and 6% for the year.
That compares with 5% growth in the 1992 fourth-quarter and a 4% gain for all of 1992.
Domestic volume rose 5% in the quarter, powered mainly by an 11% jump in fountain sales, reflecting Coca-Cola's continued strong presence in restaurants.
Bottle and can case sales grew by a more modest 2% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter.
In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Coca-Cola shares were quoted at $41.75, up 75 cents.
For all of 1993, Coca-Cola reported net income of $2.18 billion, or $1.67 a share, compared with 1992 earnings of $1.66 billion, or $1.26 a share.
Revenue grew to $13.96 billion from $13.07 billion.
