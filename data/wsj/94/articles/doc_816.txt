Blackstone Group has formed a joint venture with Interstate Hotels Corp. to invest $200 million in hotel assets.
Blackstone, a private merchant bank that has been active in the distressed real-estate market, will serve as managing partner of the venture, and Interstate, a Pittsburgh-based hotel management company, will run the properties.
Blackstone will invest $150 million, with the balance coming from Interstate.
The venture, called Interstone, has already acquired the 391-room Greenspoint Marriott in Houston from Cigna Corp. for an undisclosed sum, and has agreed to buy the Colorado Springs Marriott from PNC Bank Corp.
