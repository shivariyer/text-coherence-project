Inco Ltd., Toronto, said it will resume full operations at its Manitoba nickel operation four months ahead of schedule.
The company attributed the move to increased demand for a highly refined grade of the metal that is used mainly for plating automobile trim.
An Inco spokesman said the move will result in only a small increase in production of a specialized nickel product that should have "negligible" impact on the world's glutted nickel markets.
Inco and other nickel producers have curtailed their output in recent months because of a slump in metals prices.
Inco, which supplies about a fourth of the world's nickel, said its Manitoba employees will resume working five days a week, beginning March 7.
Workers there had previously been scheduled to operate on a four-day workweek until summer.
Also, Inco said it resumed production yesterday at its Ontario nickel facility, which was temporarily shut down at the beginning of the year.
The curtailed operations were aimed at trimming about 40 million pounds in this year's first quarter.
Inco said it plans to produce a total of 350 million pounds of nickel this year, down from 367 million pounds in 1993.
