Ted Turner, the billionaire chairman of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., pledged a total of $75 million to three schools.
Brown University, the Citadel and the McCallie School, a preparatory institution, over time will each receive $25 million.
The schools, which were attended by Mr. Turner and/or his sons, will get the money in $1 million annual increments over five years.
The remainder of the pledge is in the form of a charitable trust that is today valued at $60 million.
It will be divided equally by the three schools upon Mr. Turner's death.
