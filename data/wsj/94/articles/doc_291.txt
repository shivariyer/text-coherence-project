Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it was awarded a contract worth more than $100 million to supply power-generation equipment to Korea Electric Power Corp.
Westinghouse will supply two combustion turbines, electrical generators and related equipment for use in a 300 megawatt power plant to be built in Ilsan, South Korea.
The new power plant is an extension of an existing 600 megawatt power plant that went into commercial operation in December 1993.
Westinghouse supplied four 501D5 combustion turbines for that plant as well.
