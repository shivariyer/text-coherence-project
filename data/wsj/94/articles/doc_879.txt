City lawmakers, responding to a study projecting a decline in this city's AIDS cases, are drafting a measure asking scientists to give community groups the right to prior review of scientific reports.
It wasn't clear how strong the measure would be, but the effort signifies how intensely political information about AIDS has become, especially in this city with the highest concentration of people with the AIDS virus in the country.
Jerry Windley, legislative aide to San Francisco Supervisor Angela Alioto, who will present the draft resolution in City Hall on Monday, said city officials grew worried after banner headlines in local newspapers seemed to proclaim the epidemic over.
They worried the news may encourage unprotected sex.
Moreover, he added the city is worried Congress could reduce the city's share of federal funding for AIDS patients.
"Cases may be in decline, but the cost of AIDS is increasing because people are living longer," he said.
Author of the study, epidemiologist George Lemp, initially said he was somewhat "concerned" about prior review or control of scientific data.
But he added, "We want to work with the community, as we've done in the past."
At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, AIDS chief James Curran said, "People in public health are criticized for either overinterpreting or underinterpreting data, either blowing it up or failing to promote important public-health information."
