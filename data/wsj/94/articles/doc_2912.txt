Chrysler Corp. started recalling about 166,000 Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth 1986-model vehicles for failing to meet federal emissions standards, the Environmental Protection Agency said.
The recall for excess carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide exhaust emissions includes the Chrysler New Yorker, Laser, LeBaron, Town & Country wagon, LeBaron GTS and Limousine, Dodge Daytona, Lancer 600, Omni and Chargers, and the Plymouth Caravelle models with 2.2-liter turbo-charged engines.
The EPA said Chrysler will replace the oxygen sensor and part of the exhaust gas recirculation assembly and insulate part of the exhaust pipe to raise the catalyst operating temperature.
Repairs, which are to be done at no cost to the owners, will take about an hour, the EPA said.
It said the recall will be done in two phases, with phase one to include the Dodge Daytona, Omni GLH and Shelby Charger and Chrysler Laser models.
Remaining vehicles will be recalled about two months later.
