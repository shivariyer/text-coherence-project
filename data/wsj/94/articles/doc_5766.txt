Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., a home builder, said it expects fiscal 1994 earnings to be "at the bottom or slightly below" the range it projected earlier, due to bad weather and a decision to defer certain tax credits.
The Red Bank, N.J., company, which builds homes in New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia had forecast earnings of 80 cents to $1.05 a share for the year ending February 28.
That projection, it said, was based on the expected use of federal low-income housing tax credits for a New Jersey senior rental housing community.
The company since concluded that regulations require the credits to be applied over the coming 10 months.
The effect of the change is a 15 cents per-share reduction in net income.
The company also said severe winter weather in the East slowed fourth-quarter deliveries and increased building costs.
