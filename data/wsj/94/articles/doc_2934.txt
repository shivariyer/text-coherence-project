The city of Baltimore plans to hire Sylvan Learning Systems Inc. to provide remedial math and writing services for 500 students in two public middle schools.
Since last year, the Columbia, Md., educational services company has provided math and reading remedial services for 900 pupils in six Baltimore elementary schools.
The new middle-school program, which could take effect in a matter of weeks, is subject to approval by the Baltimore City Board of Estimates.
If approved, the company would equip the Pimlico and Greenspring middle schools with three classrooms -- two for instruction and one for a computer lab used for writing assignments -- as well as a parent conference area.
The classrooms would be open during and after school hours, and would provide a minimum ratio of one computer and instructor for every three students.
Sylvan said it would guarantee that each student in the program would attain a minimum level of academic growth, or the company would provide free additional instruction.
Sylvan, based in Columbia, Md., said the new contract would generate more than $1 million in revenue in 1994 and as much as $1.25 million in 1995.
It had $19 million in revenue in 1993.
