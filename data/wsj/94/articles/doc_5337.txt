A vigorous stock-market rally withered amid falling bond prices and a plunging dollar, but share prices still finished higher.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.28 points to 3904.06.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.05 to 470.23, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 4.06 to 785.45.
The Dow industrials shot up more than 25 points before trade frictions between the U.S. and Japan roiled the market.
Early in the session, stock-market investors ignored the sinking dollar and focused instead on the mostly benign inflation report released Friday.
A stable bond market for part of yesterday also helped prop up stock prices.
But concerns then turned to the potential fallout from the U.S.-Japan trade conflict.
Bond investors worried that a weak dollar will ignite inflation and prompt Japanese investors to sell their U.S. bonds.
That drove bond prices lower and carried stock prices right along.
Analysts said computer-guided programs were responsible both for the stock market's early advance and its later decline.
Joseph McAlinden, market strategist at Dillon Read, wasn't surprised by the stock market's about-face.
Far more surprising to him was that stock prices rallied at all.
He argued that the recent rise in interest rates has initiated a correction that will take the Dow industrials down 15% from their high.
"The key is we're in a correction phase and you'll see a lot of zigzags, head fakes and false rallies," Mr. McAlinden said.
"The trend overall will be a slow, water-torture kind of decline."
Economically sensitive stocks, which have led the market, came under heavy selling pressure.
Precious metals stocks, however, rose as gold for April delivery climbed $3.90 to $385.60 an ounce.
The only economic news came from the Commerce Department, which said December business inventories were unchanged, in line with analysts' expectations.
World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.90 to 116.92.
Stock prices rose.
Volume totaled 263.1 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,134 issues rose and 1,029 fell.
Bond prices fell.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue lost more than 1/2 point, or more than $5 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.45%.
The dollar tumbled.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.7273 marks and 102.65 yen, compared with 1.7543 marks and 106.85 yen Friday.
