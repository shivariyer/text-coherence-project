In your Jan. 20 Money Matters, "Savvy Fund Investors Can Be a Bane to Some Brokers," Jan. 20, you quoted two sentences from an article of mine, "The Pernicious Fiction of Track Record," in Investment Advisor magazine.
You used the quotes out of context.
You imply that I encourage brokers to try to divert investors' attention from mutual-fund performance, to the potential detriment of investors.
The whole point of my article was that mutual-fund performance, now more than ever, is not "the bottom line."
And that investors need an informed broker to help them understand the risk that a fund's performance may not be repeatable.
Investing primarily on the basis of past performance, I argued, ignores the cyclical nature of markets.
It won't matter, for instance, which government-bond fund one chooses if one expects that government-bond funds will return over the next decade what they did over the last -- which many of today's first-time fund investors clearly do.
If big-cap stock funds have the best record at the moment and the investor picks one on the basis of performance, he'll miss the fact that, cyclically, big-cap may now underperform small-cap.
The more one mistakenly assumes that performance is "the bottom line," the more likely one is to drive down the road looking only in the rearview mirror.
