PSI Inc. said a federal appeals court reversed a lower court's ruling in a long-running dispute over how much the utility must pay for coal from an Exxon Corp. unit.
The Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals's ruling will nearly halve the fuel savings PSI had earlier been expecting to reap, to $120 million over five years from $225 million, the holding company said.
Under a long-term agreement dating back to the mid-1970s, and scheduled to run until 2002, PSI had been accepting more than three million tons a year -- about a quarter of its total coal use -- from Exxon Coal USA's mine in western Illinois, at a cost of $38 a ton.
That price is now high, because of the dramatic decline in prices for high-sulfur coal, since air-pollution standards were tightened.
After unsuccessfully seeking to renegotiate a lower price with Exxon, PSI solicited competitive offers.
It then asked the federal court in Indianapolis to determine whether a less costly bid from Black Beauty Coal Co., which is partly owned by Chevron Corp., met the criteria for a competitive offer as required in the contract with Exxon.
The court ruled in late 1992 that the lower-cost bid met those guidelines, and that because Exxon hadn't matched the offer, the contract with Exxon could be terminated.
Black Beauty began shipping coal to PSI a year ago, at $23.28 a ton, but Exxon, after appealing the court's ruling, resumed servicing the contract in July of last year, delivering coal at $23.26 a ton.
After assorted appeals and other legal maneuvers, a three-judge panel at the appeals court in Chicago ruled this week that PSI should pay $30 a ton for the Exxon coal, rather than the $23.26 a ton that the lower court had ruled.
