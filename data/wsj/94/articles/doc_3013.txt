ASK Group Inc., which has seen sales slump and went through a management shake-up last month, said it signed a agreement with creditors giving it breathing room to get its finances in order.
The Santa Clara, Calif., company, a maker of software for automated manufacturing, said the agreement, with CIBC Inc. and First National Bank of Boston, gives it 60 days before the banks will call any loans because of the company's non-compliance with financial covenants under a $50 million credit facility.
The agreement requires that the company work closely with the banks to develop a new business plan by the end of the month .
ASK's stock fell yesterday to its lowest level since the company went public in 1991.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, its shares closed at $7.875, down 37.5 cents.
