Sharp Corp. of Japan said it plans to build a massive $470 million plant for liquid crystal displays in order to meet an expected increase in demand.
The plant, in Taki-cho, Japan, will make advanced LCDs, for use in such products as audio and video equipment, personal computers and multimedia equipment.
The plant's flagship products will be 10-inch and larger LCDs with the wide viewing angle and high resolution that are expected to be in great demand in the electronics industry in the near future, Sharp said.
The company said it would start construction in January 1995 and begin production in July.
Sharp expects to produce $440 million of LCDs in fiscal 1995.
The total floor area of the Taki-cho plant will be nearly 25% more than that of Sharp's plant at Tenri, one of the largest LCD plants in the world.
Sharp, a major electronics manufacturer based in Osaka, Japan, has more than a 40% share of the world-wide LCD market, a spokeswoman said.
