The Ontario government cut tobacco taxes sharply to stem the flow of smuggled cigarettes from the U.S. and from Quebec, where taxes were slashed earlier this month.
Ontario's tax cuts, which are being matched by cuts in federal taxes, will reduce the price of a carton of 200 cigarettes to about 23 Canadian dollars (US$17.17), from C$41.
The federal government earlier this month cut cigarette taxes by C$5 a carton, imposed a surtax on tobacco manufacturers' profits, and pledged to match any provincial tax cuts.
Quebec quickly slashed its tobacco taxes, which brought the cost of a carton in that province to C$23. New Brunswick also announced a tobacco-tax rollback.
High taxes on cigarettes led to rampant smuggling of cigarettes in the last few years, mainly Canadian cigarettes that are exported duty-free to the U.S., then smuggled back into the country.
U.S. cigarettes also are smuggled into Canada.
But Ontario has faced "a flood of cigarettes from Quebec" since Quebec cut its tobacco taxes earlier this month, said Ontario Finance Minister Floyd Laughren.
Mr. Laughren said the province will lose about C$500 million in revenue as a result of the tax cut.
The losses will have to be matched by spending cuts "to keep our deficit on a downward track," he said.
