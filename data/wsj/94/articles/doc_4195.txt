Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. said it plans to invest $50 million in a new subsidiary, Power Markets Development Co., that will invest in and develop world-wide electric power projects.
William F. Hecht, chairman, president and chief executive, said the Allentown, Pa., utility also is also planning to form a holding company that would be the "parent" of the present company and, eventually, of the new unit.
"New rules in the electric business open the door to many new opportunities, most of which are outside the traditional regulated business," Mr. Hecht noted.
The $50 million investment will come from company profit, not from ratepayers.
The holding company structure, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be submitted to shareholders at the 1995 annual meeting.
PP&L supplies electricity to a 10,000-square-mile area of 29 counties in Central Eastern Pennsylvania.
