The government's thrift regulator is considering a moratorium on approving commercial-bank bids to acquire mutual savings banks.
The Office of Thrift Supervision is expected to make a decision soon.
A moratorium would allow the OTS to stiffen its rules for protecting the financial interests of mutual savings bank depositors in a takeover, a spokesman said.
The agency is responsible for regulating most mutual savings banks, which are essentially the same as savings-and-loan institutions and are owned by their depositors.
In a House banking subcommittee's hearing Wednesday, OTS Acting Director Jonathan Fiechter and several subcommittee members said their biggest concern is that when a commercial bank acquires a mutual savings institution, the acquiring bank and the savings bank's officers and directors may benefit financially.
But the depositors can get only shares in the acquiring bank, which aren't likely to appreciate much, OTS officials said.
In comparison with OTS rules for mergers, the agency's rules are considered more effective in giving depositors the chance to share in gains from so-called conversions, in which depositor-owned mutual savings banks are turned into stockholder-owned savings banks.
Separately, Andrew Hove, acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., told the subcommittee that the FDIC is considering urging or requiring, for certain mutual savings banks that it regulates, that stock-purchase rights be issued to depositors in a conversion.
They could then sell the rights, to share in any "windfall" that officers and directors often gain from capital raised in the conversion, Mr. Hove said.
