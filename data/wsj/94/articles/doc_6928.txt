BJ Services Co. said it signed a three-year agreement with Conoco Inc. to provide services to all of Conoco's U.S. onshore drilling operations and 50% of its offshore drilling operations.
In the past, a spokesman for BJ Services said, the company had provided 30% of the oil field pressure pumping services needed by Conoco, a unit of DuPont Co.
The value of the contract will depend on the amount of drilling Conoco does.
The spokesman said Conoco paid $20 million for pressure pumping services in 1993.
