Procter & Gamble Co. and Alza Corp. said their new periodontal treatment had been cleared for marketing in the U.S.
The prescription product, to be known as Actisite, is a small packet of tetracycline, inserted directly into the periodontal pocket, for controlled, continuous release over 10 days to treat periodontitis-a progressive disease that attacks the supporting structures of teeth.
The treatment will be sold to dentists for about $20.
Actisite is manufactured by Alza and will be marketed jointly by P&G, a Cincinnati consumer products company, and Alza, of Palo Alto, Calif., a maker of therapeutic systems for administering drugs.
