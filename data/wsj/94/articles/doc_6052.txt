McDonald's Corp. is testing a walkup snack bar in downtown Atlanta as part of its plans to develop more nontraditional fast-food outlets.
The stand, similar to a restaurant drive-thru window, offers a limited menu including hamburgers and french fries, as well as food not usually associated with McDonald's, like hot dogs.
Called the "Classic" within the company, the outlet features 1950s McDonald's decor with red and white tiles and large arches overhead.
