Biotechnology research company Centocor Inc. sharply reduced its expenditures in 1993, sees continued improvement this year and could even turn a profit in 1995.
The improving fortunes of the Malvern, Pa., company will come as relief to its investors, who watched a once-promising Centocor drug, Centoxin, crash early last year after disappointing clinical trials.
"We see 1994 as a significant year of turnaround, one where we set the stage for profitability in 1995," said David Holveck, the company's president.
Centocor went on a crash financial diet last year after its widely anticipated sepsis drug proved disappointing in clinical trials.
Yesterday the company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $7 million, or 17 cents a share, on sales and contracts of $30.5 million.
A year earlier, the company lost $89.7 million, or $2.18 a share, on revenue of $33.4 million.
For the full-year, the company reported a loss of $74.4 million, or $1.79 a share, compared with a loss of $194.1 million, or $4.90 a share, for 1992.
Some analysts were impressed by a reduction in the company's "burn rate," or rate at which it spends money on operations.
Centocor ended the year with an operating cash burn of $48 million, $2 million less than budgeted when the company sharply cut back after the Centoxin results.
"We now have annual burn rates amounting to what the quarterly ones used to be," said Tim Cost, investor relations director.
A new Centocor drug CentoRx, designed to reduce clot-related complications, is showing promising results, said Carol Werther, an analyst with Cowen & Co.
But she isn't recommending the stock, in part because Centocor will have to rely on the sales staffs of big drug companies for marketing help.
But the latest results show "this company is not going out of business, and a year ago you didn't know that," she said.
