Mitsubishi Motors Sales of America Inc. said it raised prices on its vehicles by an average of $233, or 1.7%.
The biggest increase came on the midsized Galant sedan which now carries a base price of $13,600, up $598, or 3.4%, from the previous price.
Mitsubishi's entry-level model, the Mirage Coupe, now costs $9,179, up $211, or 2.1%.
Percentages are based on a sales-weighted average, which factors in new equipment and improvements.
Mitsubishi in Cypress, Calif., a unit of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp., said it raised prices "to accommodate an increase in our operating costs due to the rising value of the yen," said Richard D. Recchia, Mitsubishi's executive vice president and chief operating officer.
