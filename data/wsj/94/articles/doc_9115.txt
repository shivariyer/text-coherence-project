Baroid Corp., Houston, said it expects to report fourth-quarter net income in the range of $15 million, or 16 cents a share, to $19 million, or 20 cents a share -- better than analysts generally forecast.
The supplier of petroleum services and equipment, which agreed to be acquired by Dresser Industries Inc. in a stock purchase with an indicated value of about $850 million, also said it expects to report a fourth-quarter charge of $30 million, or 32 cents a share, related to the acquisition.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, Baroid had net income of $5.6 million, or eight cents a share, on sales of $170 million.
Baroid said the latest quarter's charge includes severance costs from the proposed Dresser purchase.
Holders of both companies are scheduled to vote on the purchase Wednesday.
Dresser makes equipment for refineries, petrochemicals and liquefied natural-gas products.
