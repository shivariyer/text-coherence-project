A unit of Bank of Boston Corp. agreed to disburse $45 million to homeowners from their escrow accounts to settle a class-action suit that alleged the company held excessive funds in the accounts.
The unit, BancBoston Mortgage Corp., a mortgage company based in Jacksonville, Fla., announced plans to settle a similar suit by the Florida attorney general last November.
In both lawsuits, and others filed in more than a dozen states, homeowners have pressed bank and mortgage companies to change their accounting methods for escrow funds paid monthly.
The funds are used to cover insurance and property taxes.
General Motors Corp.'s finance unit and Fleet Financial Group Inc. have also settled with consumers by returning funds held in escrow.
Plaintiffs in these cases successfully have argued for changing to aggregate accounting methods, effectively cutting the amount held from month to month by banks.
In the latest suit, filed in state court in Mobile, Ala., Judge Braxton L. Kittrell Jr. ruled that BancBoston Mortgage's escrow-account deposit requirements exceeded the requirements of its mortgage contracts.
Under the settlement, in which BancBoston Mortgage admits no guilt and pays no damages, each of the mortgage concern's 315,000 customers nationwide will receive an average refund of $130.
BancBoston Mortgage will also reduce by about 19% the required future balance of each account.
