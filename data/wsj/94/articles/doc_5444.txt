General Public Utilities Corp., Parsippany, N.J., said it plans a reorganization to separate power generation from distribution activities and cut costs.
The utility holding company said it will create a new unit, GPU Generation Corp. in Johnstown, Pa., to operate generating stations formerly owned or operated by its Metropolitan Edison, Pennsylvania Electric and Jersey Central Power & Light units.
The company also plans to combine the power transmission, distribution and customer-service functions of Met-Ed and Pennsylvania Electric, although the two companies won't be merged.
The realignment will result in "significant reduction" in payroll, said Chairman James R. Leva.
GPU's actions are similar to other utilities' responses to competition and changing regulation.
Companies have been trying to separate regulated from nonregulated businesses, as well as power-generation operations from power distribution.
