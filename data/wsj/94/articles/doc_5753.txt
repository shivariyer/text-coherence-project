Continental Corp., benefiting from its focus on specialty-insurance lines after withdrawing from other businesses, posted a $69 million fourth-quarter profit, compared with a year-earlier loss.
The New York property and casualty insurance company said it had net income of $1.23 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $5.9 million, or 12 cents a share.
Income from continuing operations totaled $28.6 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with a loss of $8.2 million, or 16 cents a share, the company said.
It added that it is still assessing its losses from January's earthquake in Los Angeles and the winter freeze.
It expects to release estimates of those losses later this month.
