The merged bank will retain the KeyCorp name and be based in Cleveland.
The new KeyCorp has more than 1,300 branch and affiliate offices in 18 states.
Standard & Poor's Corp. assigned a single-A-minus senior debt rating and a triple-B-plus subordinated debt rating to the combined banks.
About $800 million of long-term debt is affected.
