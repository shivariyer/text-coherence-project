Kendall Square Research Corp., mired in an accounting scandal, replaced its auditor, Price Waterhouse & Co., in what it called "a fee dispute."
The action came less than two months after Price withdrew its endorsement of Kendall's previously reported results, forcing Kendall to restate revenue sharply downward and leading to a collapse in Kendall's stock price.
Kendall Square said Coopers & Lybrand will replace Price Waterhouse.
It said it had considered competitive proposals from four different audit firms, including Price, before selecting Coopers.
Zachary Shipley, newly named treasurer of Kendall Square, a maker of supercomputers, said the change was based entirely on cost and didn't have anything to do with accounting treatment.
Mr. Shipley is a longtime aide of William Koch, Kendall's largest investor who took over as chief executive officer last month in the wake of the revenue restatement.
In New York a spokeswoman for Price said: "We're disappointed they made that decision.
A lot of companies these days do that in an effort to cut costs."
Investors watch changes in auditors closely because they sometimes signal disputes over accounting policies.
The Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies to disclose if auditor removals reflect such disputes.
However, Howard Schilit, an accounting professor at American University said companies seldom make such disclosures.
"Both sides realize there's nothing to be gained by airing dirty laundry in public.
The easiest thing is to say `we had a disagreement over fees."'
Kendall Square, a maker of massively parallel supercomputers, made the announcement late yesterday.
In over-the-counter trading Kendall Square closed at $5.375, off 50 cents, or 8.5%, on volume of 87,600 shares.
