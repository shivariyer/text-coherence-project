Chubb Corp. estimates that claims on the Los Angeles earthquake and January winter storms will reduce first-quarter earnings by $81 million, or 90 cents a share.
The insurance company said catastrophe losses for the period will total about $125 million, after reinsurance recoveries.
In the first quarter of 1993, Chubb reported operating income, which excludes capital gains, of $145.8 million, or $1.64 a share.
