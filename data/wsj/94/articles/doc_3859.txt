Genentech Inc. said it won a U.S. patent covering a versatile tissue growth factor made by gene-splicing technology.
The substance, called transforming growth factor beta, or TGF-B, promotes skin and bone growth and may prove useful for healing wounds.
Later this year, the biotechnology company said it plans to begin a clinical trial of TGF-B for the prevention of mucositis, or severe mouth ulcers that occur as a side effect of cancer chemotherapy.
Genentech's patent covers materials and techniques for making a synthetic version of TGF-B through gene-splicing or recombinant DNA technology.
Genentech, based in South San Francisco, Calif., is a licensee of a TGF-B patent covering the natural protein held by the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Md.
