Industrial sales in the Netherlands dropped 6% in the fourth quarter of last year from the final three months of 1992, the government said.
Dragged down by 7% lower domestic deliveries and a 5% decline in exports, Dutch industry in general sold 6% less in all of 1993 than a year earlier, preliminary figures from the government's Central Bureau for Statistics show.
The 6% drop in the October-December period came after a 5% decline in the third quarter of 1993.
But a government economist said early signs are that industrial production in January may have recovered, perhaps indicating higher sales, too.
The government has yet to report on January industrial production.
