Leviathan Gas Pipeline Partners L.P. and a Tenneco Inc. unit agreed to jointly build a pipeline system to gather natural gas from producing properties offshore Louisiana.
The properties being developed are in the Viosca Knoll and Main Pass areas.
Leviathan and Tenneco Gas Gathering Co. will each own half of the gathering facilities.
The partners will build a 95-mile pipeline from a platform in Main Pass Block 252 to a connecting point with another company's line in South Pass Block 55.
Leviathan and Tenneco Gas also plan to build a six-mile pipeline from Viosca Knoll Block 817 to a connecting point with a platform in Main Pass Block 289.
The system will be able to transport more than 400 million cubic feet of gas a day.
Pipeline installation is expected to start during the summer, with initial deliveries to begin by the fourth quarter.
Leviathan Gas is a partnership formed to buy, own and manage offshore natural gas pipeline systems and related assets.
