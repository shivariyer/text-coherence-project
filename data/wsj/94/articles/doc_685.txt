The Senate approved President Clinton's $1.5 trillion fiscal 1995 budget, but only after squeezing spending more than the White House wanted.
The administration and Democratic leaders will now try to water down the cuts -- $26 billion over five years from programs yet to be identified -- in compromise negotiations with the House next month.
They probably can't restore all of the money, however.
"It's going to be difficult to totally eliminate the reductions," Budget Director Leon Panetta said.
That means defense and domestic spending -- already subject to stringent caps as a result of last year's deficit-reduction program -- must be pared even further.
The Senate approved the budget resolution on a near party-line vote of 57-40.
No Democrats defected, while Republicans Mark Hatfield of Oregon and James Jeffords of Vermont backed the spending blueprint for the year that starts Oct. 1.
While the extra budget cuts would come from discretionary spending programs -- those subject to annual appropriations -- the Senate also signaled it may seek formally to restrain the growth in mandatory benefit programs once Congress overhauls the health-care system.
By voice vote, the Senate adopted a bipartisan resolution calling for caps on entitlement spending beginning in 1996.
