Ford Motor Co. unveiled a high-tech, front-drive transmission, moving closer to solving one of its profitability problems.
The transmission will be used in certain Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable models and in the next-generation Lincoln Continental.
The AX4N transmission, which cost $680 million to develop, including costs of retooling the factory here, will appear in vehicles later this year, and Ford will eventually build 550,000 of them a year.
The transmission is part of a $5 billion overhaul launched in 1989.
The revamping involves five engines and five transmissions, including a new 2.5-liter V-6, to be unveiled next month, and a family of truck engines, to debut next year.
Ford has been one of the last of the world's major auto makers to overhaul its engines and transmissions, and industry analysts and consultants say that's one reason Ford has had to spend much more than its rivals on marketing its cars.
"In the 1980s, Ford wasn't very rigorous in investing in powertrains, and they began to fall behind," says Christopher Cedergren, AutoPacific Group Inc.'s auto analyst.
"It hurt their credibility and image in certain product lines."
But the new engines and transmissions are expected to change all that, industry experts say.
"By the end of the decade, their powertrains will be at parity with the best in the industry," says Jeff Sinclair, a McKinsey & Co. consultant to the auto industry.
He says this will allow Ford to cut back on promotion expenses and reap higher revenues per vehicle.
Ford's automatic transmissions, particularly, have been a weak spot.
They tended to be clunky, loud and jerky when shifting.
Some industry experts rate Ford's powertrains among the worst in the industry.
