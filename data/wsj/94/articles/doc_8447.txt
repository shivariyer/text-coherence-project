Einar Kloster, head of the lighting division of Philips Electronics NV, resigned.
The 56-year-old Mr. Kloster will step down from his position "over the course of the year," a Philips spokesman said, without being more specific.
A successor hasn't yet been named.
Mr. Kloster, who joined the Dutch electronics company in 1961, has been a member of the 13-member Philips Group Management Committee, but remains outside the five-member board that is headed by Jan Timmer.
The company's top management has experienced major upheavals since 1990, when Cor van der Klugt was fired as chairman, ostensibly for making misleading public statements about profit trends.
Upon succeeding Mr. van der Klugt, Mr. Timmer immediately initiated a far-reaching restructuring program to downsize the bloated and money-losing Philips.
And the board, which for decades had been characterized as a chummy group of "good ol' boys" with longtime Philips service, was suddenly shaken out and in 1992 and 1993 restocked with the high-profile corporate talent from outside Eindhoven and even from outside the electronics business.
