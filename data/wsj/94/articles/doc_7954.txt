Nashua Corp. said it will make a payment of $1.3 million plus interest to Gestetner Holdings PLC for an arbitrator's ruling on claims associated with Nashua's sale of its international office systems business to Gestetner.
Nashua said it will recognize a gain from discontinued operations of $2.5 million, or 40 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from the resolution of the claim.
The Nashua, N.H., company had been required to defer recognition of any gain or loss from the sale, pending the resolution.
Nashua, a computer and office products concern, sold the office systems business in 1990 for $202 million, which included $51 million in debt assumed by Gestetner.
Gestetner questioned the final valuation, resulting in $18.2 million in claims submitted for arbitration.
The company reported earnings of $2.2 million, or 35 cents a share, on sales of $145.2 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 1992.
The results included a gain of $900,000 for the settlement of litigation with MiniScribe Corp. and $1.2 million from the sale of stock.
