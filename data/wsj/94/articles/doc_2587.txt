AmSouth Bancorp. said it agreed to acquire Tampa Banking Co. in a transaction valued at about $32.3 million.
Under terms of the agreement, AmSouth will exchange 1.5592 shares of AmSouth common stock for each of the 677,000 shares of closely held Tampa Banking.
The acquisition, which is scheduled for completion by year end, is the latest in a string of Florida acquisitions by the Alabama banking concern.
At the end of 1993, AmSouth had 64 offices in Florida.
