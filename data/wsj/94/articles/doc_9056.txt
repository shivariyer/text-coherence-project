The former president of Western Savings & Loan Association, a defunct Arizona thrift associated with convicted financier Charles W. Knapp, was indicted on charges of fraud, conspiracy, misapplication of funds and making false statements to regulators.
The 25-count indictment of Gary Driggs by a federal grand jury here last week came more than two years after he and about 50 other officers and associates of the thrift were named in a civil lawsuit filed by the government seeking more than $1 billion in damages.
Once Arizona's second-largest thrift, Western Savings was seized by regulators in June 1989 at an estimated $1.7 billion loss to taxpayers.
Michael Hawkins, an attorney for Mr. Driggs, said the criminal charges "are a rehash of the civil suit" that's still pending, adding that his client intends to fight the indictment.
