TRW Inc. said it expects its world-wide sales of air-bag modules to reach 9.1 million units in 1994 and 13.6 million in 1995, compared with 1993 sales of 4.6 million units.
Adolf Mueller, executive vice president of the company's occupant restraints and controls group, told the McDonald & Co.
Investments Inc. automobile conference in New York that TRW expects sales of its automotive products to Japanese customers to rise to $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion by 1997, compared with sales of slightly more than $600 million in 1993.
In 1993, sales to Japanese customers accounted for about 13% of the company's automotive business, Mr. Mueller said.
TRW's automotive business accounts for about 57% of its sales, with space and defense accounting for about 35% and information services about 8%.
