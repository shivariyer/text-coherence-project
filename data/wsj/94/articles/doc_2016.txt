In your March 3 editorial "Clinton's French Bureaucrats" you state that "the Clintonites like markets, but in about the same way that French bureaucrats have always liked the markets -- in a strong embrace."
You go on to blame the collapse of the TCI-Bell Atlantic merger on the FCC's 7% reduction in cable rates.
Government regulation is often harmful to business, but your contention that "the markets" are somehow represented in this case by the managers of TCI and Bell Atlantic is, in my view, incorrect.
In fact, markets are represented by shareholders, not by managers or directors, and in this case it is clear that shareholders and "the markets," by depressing the stock prices of both firms, voted against the megamerger in question.
You fail to recognize the significance of this free-market signal when you further add that "Ray Smith and . . .
John Malone would have found a way to complete the merger, despite declines in their companies' share prices."
Why should they?
The owners of their companies do not seem to want it.
If they succeed "despite declines in their companies' share prices," are they not flouting the same free market your editorial sought to defend?
