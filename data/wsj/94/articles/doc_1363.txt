Krug International Corp., blaming a sluggish economy in the United Kingdom, said it won't meet its projection of a 20% gain in earnings from continuing operations in the fiscal year ending March 31.
The Dayton, Ohio, company also said it won't complete the refinancing of its $11.8 million in domestic bank loans by the end of the fiscal year, as it had said.
A spokeswoman declined to say what might happen if Krug fails to refinance the loans by July 29, when they are due.
But the company said it remains hopeful it can complete the refinancing by the June mailing of its annual report.
While earnings from continuing operations won't meet projections, the company said it still expects to post a gain from fiscal 1993, when it earned $2.6 million.
Krug also blamed higher costs from the resolution of labor negotiations in the U.K. for its lower-than-projected earnings from continuing operations.
Krug also said it sold its Alpha Net network systems integration business to NBI Inc., of Longmont, Colo.
