Phillips Petroleum Co., Bartlesville, Okla., said amended plans for rebuilding Norway's Ekofisk oil field put the cost at about $3 billion, compared with earlier estimates of as much as $4 billion.
Phillips said the Norwegian government's objections to parts of the original December 1993 plan as well as additional studies prompted the unit, Phillips Petroleum Co.
Norway, and its partners in Phillips Norway Group to amend the plan.
The oil and natural gas company said the new plan makes greater use of the field's existing infrastructure while conforming with Norwegian safety requirements.
Phillips said it expects the Norwegian Parliament to make a decision on the amended plan late in its spring session.
Phillips said its unit has a 36.96% interest in Phillips Norway Group.
Other partners are: subsidiaries of Petrofina SA of Brussels, 30%; Italy's state-owned oil company, Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, 13.04%; Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine of France, 7.59%; and Norsk Hydro SA of Norway, 6.7%.
The remaining interests are held by small European companies.
