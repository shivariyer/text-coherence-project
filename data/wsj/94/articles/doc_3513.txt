Boral Ltd., an Australian building materials and energy company, reported that operating profit after tax fell 96% to 4.6 million Australian dollars (US$3.3 million) in the first half ended Dec. 31.
Sydney-based Boral also announced plans to raise A$353.7 million through a rights issue of 98.26 million ordinary or common shares at A$3.60 (US$2.57) each.
The shares will be offered to existing shareholders on the basis of one new Boral share for every 10 they now hold.
Boral said in a statement that proceeds from the rights issue will be used to retire debt.
The drop in interim profit was attributed to a number of extraordinary losses totaling A$162.2 million.
These items include a provision of A$158.3 million for the cost of restructuring its operations and selling some assets.
