Several big airlines matched two fare promotions that offer major discounts for domestic travel.
One of the limited-time promotions, launched yesterday by Trans World Airlines, offered discounts of as much as 35%.
TWA, based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said the lower-priced tickets will be good through May 15 for travel in the continental U.S., to Hawaii and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
A separate promotion, also initiated by TWA, offers lower fares to Florida from New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Washington.
The round-trip fares, from $198 to $258 depending on the weekday, offer savings of as much as 45%, TWA said.
Those fares are good for travel through Feb. 15.
Under both programs, which require Saturday night stays and advance purchases, tickets must be bought by Friday.
The nation's three largest carriers -- UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and Delta Air Lines -- all said they would match the promotions, sometimes with differences in rules and restrictions, in markets where they compete with TWA.
