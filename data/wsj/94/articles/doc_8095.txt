Clorox Co., boosted by new products, said profit rose 13% in its fiscal second quarter, ended Dec. 31.
The earnings of $30.6 million, or 57 cents a share, compare with year-earlier net income of $27.2 million, or 50 cents a share.
Revenue rose 13% to $370.8 million from $327.4 million the year earlier.
For the first six months, the Oakland, Calif., maker of household products said profit rose 37% to $109 million, or $2.01 a share, on sales of $820.6 million, from $71.8 million, or $1.32 a share, on sales of $722 million, the year before.
The most recent six-month period included a gain of $32.1 million, or 59 cents a share, on sale of discontinued operations.
The company attributed the improved quarterly results primarily to the increase in shipments, driven by new products, and greater operating efficiencies.
New products included Liquid-Plumr build-up remover, Tilex soap scum remover, Formula 409 glass and surface cleaner and Clorox toilet-bowl cleanser and automatic toiletbowl cleaner.
