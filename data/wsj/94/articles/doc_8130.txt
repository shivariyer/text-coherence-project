Action Auto Rental Inc., which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a year ago, filed documents with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Cleveland to permit the orderly liquidation of its assets.
The auto rental concern said the decision to liquidate "is a consensual one with General Motors Acceptance Corp. after the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the terms of future financing for the company."
Action said it could not attract alternative financing.
In Detroit, GMAC said it had been providing financing for Action Auto's car fleet for the past decade and is the concern's largest creditor.
GMAC, the finance arm of General Motors Corp., said it is owed about $40 million and is seeking to take possession of and liquidate slightly more than 5,000 GM vehicles.
Action, GMAC and the Unsecured Creditors' Committee agreed that top Action managers will supervise the orderly winddown and liquidation, which will begin immediately.
Craig Hons, Action's president, said the company's 500 employees "will be able to receive a fair severance package."
Car rentals ceased yesterday.
Action said it will help long-term renters find other companies while short-term rentals will be allowed to run their normal course.
Action Auto said that in the next several weeks it will file a comprehensive plan of orderly liquidation with the Bankruptcy Court.
The plan will contemplate resolution of all litigation by and between Action, GMAC and the Unsecured Creditors' Committee, and for payment of all costs of administration and all priority claims.
