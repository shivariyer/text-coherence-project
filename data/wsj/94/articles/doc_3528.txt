Lawrence Insurance Group Inc. said it expects to post a loss of about $10 million for 1993 because of "continuing adverse results" at its United Community Insurance Co. unit.
In addition, Chairman Albert W. Lawrence said he couldn't rule out a further deterioration of United Community's position as the company determines expected losses in the workers' compensation, auto, and liability lines of business.
Lawrence said the other companies in the group had "satisfactory" results but couldn't compensate for UCIC's troubles.
The company said UCIC had dropped, or greatly reduced, its weaker lines of business over the past 2 1/2 years, but that the aftereffects "would remain for some time."
Mr. Lawrence said the downsizing of UCIC is likely to result in job cuts.
Lawrence's shares sank 12.5 cents to $3.375 in American Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
