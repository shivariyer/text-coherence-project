German chemicals group Bayer AG reported a 12% decline in group profit last year on higher research-and-development and capital spending, but said it would hold its dividend for 1993 unchanged.
Group profit fell to 1.37 billion marks ($810.8 million) from 1.56 billion marks, while group sales edged down 0.5% to 41 billion marks from 41.2 billion marks.
The company also said it would ask shareholders to approve the abolition of its 5% voting-rights limitation, in effect since 1975.
The Leverkusen-based company said its group pretax profit fell 13% to 2.35 billion marks last year.
That's considerably better than the 20% drop in full-year group pretax earnings projected by Bayer Chairman Manfred Schneider in November.
Capital expenditures last year came to 3.16 billion marks, up 10% from 1992, Bayer said.
Research and development expenses rose 1.9% to 3.16 billion marks in 1993.
