The problem of AIDS orphans -- long a concern in Africa, where the epidemic has primarily affected heterosexuals -- is about to burgeon in the U.S., according to a New York research report.
U.S. children orphaned by AIDS are projected to total between 72,000 and 125,000 by the year 2000, according to the Orphan Project, a study group run by the Fund for the City of New York.
That includes 30,000 such orphans in New York alone, the study's authors forecast.
The spotlight on AIDS orphans -- and on the attendant problems of custody, housing and mental-health care -- underscores the epidemic's shift in the U.S. from an illness of gay men and intravenous-drug users to one that increasingly affects heterosexuals, often those who are partners of drug users.
In 1993, for example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said AIDS cases resulting from heterosexual contact grew 130% to 9,288 from 4,045 in 1992.
Overall, heterosexual AIDS cases have mushroomed to 9% of the total U.S. caseload from less than 2% in 1985.
Study author David Michaels, an epidemiologist at the City University of New York, contended his figures are conservative, because they focus on children and teenagers orphaned by the death of their mothers.
Children whose fathers die aren't included as a result of a lack of data.
He also pointed out that while some children of infected mothers acquire the virus, most AIDS orphans are uninfected.
Recent findings that a Wellcome PLC drug blocks the spread of the AIDS virus from mother to child will increase the urgency of the situation, he added.
"The good news that AZT seems to reduce HIV transmission to newborns is unfortunately accompanied by the bad news that infants spared from AIDS will still be orphaned."
