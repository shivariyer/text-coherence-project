Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded the rating assigned to the outstanding $83.5 million subordinated note issue, due 1995, at this company's department-store chain unit, Woodward & Lothrop Inc.
The rating agency lowered its rating from single-Caa to single-C.
Moody's said the downgrade reflects the unit's recent decision to seek Chapter 11 protection.
