American Telephone & Telegraph Co. filed a proposal to increase rates about 4% on certain business long-distance and 800 services, and a proposal to restructure rates for small businesses.
The rate increases would generate about $165 million a year in additional revenue, a company spokeswoman said.
The increases would cover many of the company's domestic and international business services.
AT&T in Basking Ridge, N.J., also proposed to restructure rates for domestic and international basic long-distance service for small businesses so it can offer those customers volume discounts.
Rate increases are effective Friday, and the restructuring is effective March 1, pending Federal Communications Commission approval.
