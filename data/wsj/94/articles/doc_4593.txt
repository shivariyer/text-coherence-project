Southland Corp. in Dallas reported a widened fourth-quarter loss and a 5.9% drop in revenue, reflecting the company's continuing retrenchment program.
But the convenience-store retailer and operator and franchiser of 7-Eleven stores, asserting that its recovery is on track, said its profit before one-time charges grew 26% to $14.9 million from $11.8 million.
The charges mostly consisted of losses related to the closing of stores.
The company's net loss in the latest quarter was $36.4 million on revenue of $1.63 billion, compared with a loss of $29.4 million on revenue of $1.73 billion.
Southland in Dallas, which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings in early 1991, attributed the operating improvement to strength in its retail-gasoline business, lower interest expenses and further reduction of operating costs.
