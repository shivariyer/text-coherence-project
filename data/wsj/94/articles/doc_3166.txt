Canon Computer Systems Inc., the U.S. arm of Japanese electronics company Canon Inc., said it will soon begin manufacturing personal-computer workstations for Next Computer Inc.
Under the agreement, Canon Computer Systems, in Costa Mesa, Calif., said it hopes to ship its first product, called the Canon NEXTstation, in the second quarter.
The first machine will be powered by an Intel Corp. 486 microprocessor, with a subsequent machine to be built around Intel's new Pentium chip.
Last year, Next, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., left the computer hardware business to concentrate on software.
Canon Inc. was an early investor in Next, which was launched by Apple Computer Inc.'s founder Steven Jobs.
