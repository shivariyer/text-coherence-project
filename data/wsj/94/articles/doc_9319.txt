Bond prices plunged on a stronger-than-expected retail sales report.
Stocks and the dollar were mixed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 6.20 points to 3842.43.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 1.70 to 472.47, but the Nasdaq Composite Index inched up 0.94 to a record 787.81.
Bond traders ignored positive inflation news and focused instead on evidence of robust retail sales for December.
Robert Goodman, senior economic adviser at Putnam Investments, said the strong retail sales figures kept fears of inflation alive.
"Bond traders are associating economic growth and inflation pressures, and they're dead wrong," Mr. Goodman said.
A recent slump in the Dow Jones Utility Average, often an indicator of interest-rate trends, suggests a further climb in interest rates, said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers.
"The utility average is flashing a big yellow warning sign that the bond market may have some trouble ahead," Mr. Shulman said.

The Dow Jones World Stock Index dropped 0.89 to 111.82.
