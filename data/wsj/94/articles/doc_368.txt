Parker Hannifin Corp. will sell most of its aerospace-metal bellows business to Senior Flexonics Inc., the Chicago-based unit of Senior Engineering Group PLC, Rickmansworth, England.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The Cleveland-based producer of motion-control components and systems said it will sell the Parker Metal Bellows division in Sharon, Mass., and most lines produced in the division's Moorpark, Calif., facility.
Parker Hannifin said the transaction is part of its aerospace group's restructuring plan, which also has involved consolidation of other facilities and divisions.
Production will continue at the Sharon facility, while positions at the Moorpark plant will be moved to Senior Flexonics plants in the U.S.
The 120 workers at the Moorpark facility will lose their jobs as work is phased out.
