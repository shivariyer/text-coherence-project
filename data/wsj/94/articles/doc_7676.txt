Hoechst AG confirmed it is discussing spinning off a part of its fibers business into an independent unit but said it is in the earliest stages.
"It is a theme that is in discussion, but it's far from any decision," said a spokeswoman for Hoechst, one of Germany's major chemicals group.
No further details were available.
Last week Hoechst said it would cut 2,000 jobs in its western Europe fibers operations by the end of 1995.
