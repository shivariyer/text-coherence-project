Nintendo of America Inc., betting its chips on microchips, said its next-generation video-game machine will continue to be based on cartridge play rather than CD-ROM.
The 64-bit game system, code named Project Reality, is being developed by Nintendo, the U.S. unit of Japan's Nintendo Co., and Silicon Graphics Inc., Mountain View, Calif.
It is set to make its debut in arcades during the fourth quarter, followed by a world-wide launch to homes next year.
Nintendo said the home machines would be brought to market for under $250.
Project Reality will succeed Nintendo's current mainstay player, a 16-bit machine called the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
Project Reality will be powered by Silicon Graphics' speedy MIPS microprocessor, providing five to six times the memory of the current 16-bit Nintendo games and allowing for superior graphics, sound and music.
Silicon Graphics' officials said their MIPS chip is so fast at accessing data, that game images will appear instantly rather than at the slight delay associated with CD-ROMs (compact disk, read-only-memory).
Mark Hannah, Silicon Graphic's chief scientist, said the MIPS chip would also enable Project Reality machines to run video at full motion on the television screen, rather than in the jerky images now prevalent on weaker systems.
Nintendo hopes Project Reality will help it recapture market share from archrival Sega of America Inc., a unit of Japan's Sega Enterprises Ltd., which has made huge inroads into Nintendo's once dominant hold on the $6 billion-a-year U.S. video-game market.
But analysts say Nintendo isn't likely to regain the dominance it held in the late 1980s, when competition was scarce.
Besides Sega, which is working with Hitachi Ltd. to develop a new version of the Sega Genesis player, Nintendo faces competition from smaller rivals including 3DO Co. and Atari Corp.
