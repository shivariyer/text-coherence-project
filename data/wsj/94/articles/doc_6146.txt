American President Cos. said its American President Lines unit would begin a regular container transportion service to Vietnam.
The Oakland, Calif., company said it has opened an office in Ho Chi Minh City and that full export service from Vietnam will begin immediately.
Some import activity also will be available now, with the remainder subject to restrictions expected to be lifted shortly.
The company said its service will link Vietnam with markets in North America, Asia and the Middle East.
American President said it expects U.S. commerce with Vietnam to grow in the double-digit range for the foreseeable future, following the lifting of the 19-year U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam on Feb. 3.
