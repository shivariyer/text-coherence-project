France wants to privatize state-owned car maker Renault SA "as quickly as possible," Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said in a newspaper interview to be published today.
Mr. Longuet's remark appears to contradict indications by aides to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur over the weekend that the government isn't in a hurry to bring Renault to the market.
In the interview with the newspaper Ouest France, Mr. Longuet said, "I want Renault to be the next industrial company to be privatized" after Framatome, a French company specialized in building nuclear reactors.
Mr. Longuet's aides weren't available last night to confirm the minister's remarks.
Over the weekend, Mr. Balladur's aides had indicated that Renault's privatization "isn't essential to the budget in 1994," and that "no formal decision has been made" to put it on the block.
Commentaries in the French press have suggested that some members of the Balladur government are worried that Renault's privatization might spark labor unrest inside the car maker that would look bad in the run-up to the presidential elections in May 1995.
