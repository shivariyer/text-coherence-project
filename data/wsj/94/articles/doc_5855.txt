Arkla Inc. said it plans to change its name to NorAm Energy Corp.
The company said the change is subject to shareholders' approval at the annual meeting May 10.
The company said that with the addition of Mississippi River Transmission, Entex and Minnegasco, it has outgrown the geographical boundaries suggested by the name Arkla.
Arkla's three distribution divisions, Entex, Minnegasco and Arkansas Louisiana Gas, as well as Mississippi River Transmission, will retain their current identities.
However, Arkla Energy Resources and Arkla Energy Marketing will operate under new names in conjunction with the corporate name change.
