Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it reached an agreement with Digital Equipment Corp., under which Digital will help it produce 486 microchips.
Digital will produce wafers at its facility in South Queensferry, Scotland, that will be used by Advanced Micro to meet growing demand for its 486 chips, the company said.
Advanced Micro makes chips that are compatible with Intel Corp.'s flagship 486 chips, used in today's most popular personal computers.
Advanced Micro is embroiled in a series of legal disputes with Intel, including the retrial of a copyright-infringement lawsuit filed by Intel, which alleges AMD has illegally copied its chips.
Initial shipments of Advanced Micro 486 chips, made from wafers produced by Digital, are expected in the fourth quarter.
By 1995, the company expects to be producing two million units a year as a result of the agreement with Digital.
The agreement, the first of its kind for AMD's microproccessor business, is to last two years, with an option for an extension at the end of that period.
An AMD spokesman said demand for the company's 486 chips exceeds the four million units a year it currently produces.
The company is building a factory in Texas that isn't expected to be in volume production until the end of next year.
