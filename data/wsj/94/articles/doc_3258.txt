Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. said it cut its fiscal 1995 capital budget by 21%, to $230.8 million.
The company said the move was required in light of deteriorating crude oil and natural gas liquids prices.
Mitchell said natural gas liquids production is one of the company's most important businesses.
