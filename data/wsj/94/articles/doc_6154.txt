The parents of a deceased Florida child sued Copley Pharmaceutical Inc., alleging their 26-month-old boy died as a result of taking Copley's recalled medication, Albuterol.
The lawsuit, which claims classaction status, was the first in which plaintiffs linked the drug to a death.
Copley, of Canton, Mass., recalled Albuterol last month after finding bacteria in the drug, which is used as an inhalant.
A Copley representative couldn't be reached for comment.
The company has declined comment on other lawsuits alleging a link between Albuterol and serious illness in children in Illinois and Arizona.
The suit was filed in state court here by Patricia and Rodney Stebbins.
There has been no ruling on its request for class-action status.
