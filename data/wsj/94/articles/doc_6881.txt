Rochester Telephone Corp. announced a voluntary early-retirement plan that includes enhanced pension benefits and said it expects that 50 to 100 of its employees will opt for it.
The Rochester, N.Y., company said that under the program, it will grant certain eligible employees an additional five years' worth of age and service accrued as of March 31, 1994, which will be considered when determining an employee's pension.
Rochester Telephone said it estimates that about 1,400 of its workers are eligible for the program, with 400 of them eligible to receive a service pension immediately.
Those employees who decide to retire by March 31 and who declare their intention by March 15 will receive the prepension-leave benefit, which is being discontinued, the company said.
