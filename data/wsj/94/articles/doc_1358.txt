Several members of the founding families of Germany's Porsche AG sold a portion of their nonvoting shares to finance acquisition of new voting stock in today's rights issue, the company confirmed yesterday.
Germany's Piech and Porsche families hold 100% of the company's common shares, which carry voting rights.
That holding, in turn, amounts to exactly 50% of the company's total equity capital, with the remaining 50% consisting of freely traded, nonvoting preferred shares.
As part of the capital increase, the two families have agreed to buy all the common shares in order to preserve their 100% voting-rights ratio within the current shareholding structure.
Under the capital increase, Porsche will create 175,000 new common shares and 175,000 new preferred shares.
They will be offered in a 1-to-4 subscription and priced at 575 marks ($339).
Porsche also confirmed that group sales rose 20% to 980 million marks ($578.2 million) in the fiscal first half ended in January, from 820 million marks a year earlier, and it revised its six-month group loss to 114 million marks from a preliminary 115 million marks, compared with a 120 million mark loss a year earlier.
