Weak European stocks also set the stage for a sell-off here.
London and Frankfurt shares dropped following rumors of a possible coup in Russia.
"The technical underpinnings in the market leave a lot to be desired," said Alan Ackerman, an executive vice president at Reich & Co.
"Bonds act like shredded wheat, causing stocks to act equally poorly.
We've got inflation jitters, rate jitters, just a potpourri of jitters."
Mr. Ackerman said sectors and individual stocks "are getting smashed" because of the nervousness.
Aside from yesterday, recent declines, he added, "have been like Chinese water torture -- the declines come day after day, slowly and painfully, rather than all at once."
