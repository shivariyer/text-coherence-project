Consumers in December expanded their debt loads for the seventh straight month.
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit increased at an 11.2% annual rate in the last month of 1993, rising $7.28 billion to $789.84 billion.
The strong rise came on top of a 10.7% annual-rate increase in November.
The December figure was 6.6% higher than a year earlier.
The buying binge during December was fueled by low interest rates, which enticed consumers to buy everything from cars to furniture to trips on credit.
Economists, however, expect consumer spending to slow down in the first half of this year, following a more than 14% annual rate of increased spending for durable-goods purchases in the last quarter of 1993.
The largest rise during December came in a catchall category that includes loans for mobile homes, school tuition and vacations.
That rose at a 17.9% annual rate, compared with a 9.4% rate the month before.
Growth in auto-loans outstanding rose at a 6.4% pace in December.
That was a big slowdown from the double-digit growth in auto loans in November and October.
Revolving credit, which includes bank and department-store cards, rose at a 10.4% annual rate in the latest period, up from a 9.3% rate in November.
Figures have been adjusted for normal seasonal variations.
