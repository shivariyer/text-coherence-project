U.S. manufacturers' orders rose in January for the sixth month in a row, one of the few economic signals that haven't been set back by this year's bitter winter.
The Commerce Department said factory orders rose 2.1% from December, when they increased 1.4%.
Bookings for nondurable goods, those intended to last less than three years, edged up 0.4% in January, the Department said.
Orders for durables rose 3.7%, the same as in a preliminary report issued last week.
The numbers indicate the increasing strength of the economy, said Joseph Liro, chief economist of S.G. Warburg & Co., in New York.
He added that he expects the "momentum to continue through 1994."
But Donald Maude, an economist at ScotiaMcLeod in New York, noted that "there was a big bulge in orders for aircraft and aircraft parts," a category that changes a lot from month to month.
"Considering the lag time between orders and production, the increase doesn't carry as much significance for near-term production," according to Mr. Maude.
He said he expects the economy to continue getting stronger, but at a more "subdued rate."
Unfilled orders for both durable and nondurable goods increased in January, signaling the possibility of more factory employment.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits plunged 57,000 last week to 318,000 from a revised 375,000 the previous week.
Officials said claims may have been reduced because of the Monday holiday.
Claims averaged 352,500 in the four weeks ended Feb. 26, down from a revised 375,000 for the four weeks ended Feb. 19.
Economists consider the four-week average a better guide to labor-market conditions than the weekly figure.
All figures have been adjusted for normal seasonal variations.
Here are the Commerce Department's latest figures for manufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted.
