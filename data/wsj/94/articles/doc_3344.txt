Jenny Craig Inc. said Albert J. DiMarco stepped down as president and chief operating officer after three months at the weight-loss concern, citing personal reasons.
Mr. DiMarco, 51 years old, was once chairman and chief executive of rival Nutri/System Inc.
Ellen Destray, 42, Jenny Craig's senior vice president-operations, was promoted to chief operating officer.
The president post wasn't filled.
