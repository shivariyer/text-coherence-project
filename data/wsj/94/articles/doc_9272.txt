Crestar Financial Corp., a Richmond, Va., bank holding company, said fourth-quarter net income rose 39% because of higher interest income and lower provisions for loan losses.
A focus on consumer and middle-market lending also helped to boost earnings, a spokesman said.
Net income totaled $38.7 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $27.9 million, or 78 cents a share, a year ago.
Net interest income totaled $138 million, up 6% from $129.6 million a year ago.
The provision for loan losses was $13.5 million, down from $18.7 million in the 1992 fourth quarter.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Crestar was unchanged at $41.875.
