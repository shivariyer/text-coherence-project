Merck & Co. said its chicken pox vaccine was favorably reviewed late yesterday by a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee.
The committee found that the data presented by Merck support the company's claims that the vaccine, Varivax, is safe and efficacious in children and adults, according to Merck.
The FDA usually but doesn't always follow the recommendations of its committees.
FDA officials couldn't be reached.
The vaccine had been recommended for approval by an FDA committee four years ago, but the government agency asked the company to provide additional safety and effectiveness data, which was presented yesterday.
Since 1981, Varivax has been tested in clinical trials involving more than 11,000 children and adults, according to Merck.
If approved, Varivax will be the first vaccine in the U.S. against the disease, which strikes an estimated 3.5 million people in the U.S. a year.
The disease usually causes mild, although uncomfortable, symptoms, but in rare cases complications develop, resulting in about 9,000 hospitalizations and between 50 and 100 deaths a year, according to Merck.
Some medical professionals have questioned whether the immunity caused by the vaccine will wane over time, causing chicken pox to strike in adulthood, when it is far more serious.
The clinical studies have followed some patients for as long as nine years, and immunity doesn't appear to diminish, said R. Gordon Douglas Jr., head of the Merck vaccine division.
If approved, the drug is expected to generate annual sales of about $130 million in a few years, said Ronald Nordmann, an analyst at PaineWebber.
Dr. Douglas declined to comment on the estimate.
