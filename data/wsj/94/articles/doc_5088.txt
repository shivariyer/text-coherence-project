Geotek Industries Inc. shareholders approved a change in the company's name to Geotek Communications Inc., and an increase in authorized common shares to facilitate an investment in the company by Vanguard Cellular Systems Inc.
The wireless-communications concern said it will issue as many as 14 million shares of common stock to Vanguard, a Greensboro, N.C., operator of cellular-telephone systems.
Vanguard late last year announced an initial investment of $30 million and also acquired options to invest an additional $167 million over the next three years.
If Vanguard exercised all its rights, it would own 20% of Geotek on a diluted basis.
