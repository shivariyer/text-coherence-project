America's soft-drink giants are wasting no time preparing for the end of the U.S. economic embargo against Vietnam.
Pepsi-Cola International, PepsiCo Inc.'s international soft-drinks arm, has signed a preliminary agreement with one of Vietnam's largest beverage companies to bottle soft drinks in that country.
For the past few months, Pepsi-Cola International has had a ship loaded with Pepsi concentrate, bottle caps, cans and bottles anchored in Singapore and awaiting word it can head for Vietnam, according to Barry Shea, a vice president of Pepsi-Cola International.
Already prepared is Pepsi's first TV commercial aimed at the Vietnamese market, produced by Ogilvy & Mather and featuring Miss Vietnam.
In March of 1993, Pepsi gave the franchise in Vietnam to a joint venture in Ho Chi Minh City.
Pepsi has no equity stake in the venture, called International Beverages Co., which is between a Vietnamese company called SP Co. and a Singapore company named Macondray & Co.
Meanwhile, archrival Coca-Cola Co. is also busy preparing its formal entry into Vietnam, where it already enjoys wide distribution on the black market.
Coke and Singapore soft-drinks company Fraser & Neave Ltd. formed a joint venture last March with Thai Pure Soft Drinks Ltd. as part of a strategy to tap the Indochinese market.
The venture will produce Coke and other soft drinks in a retooled Ho Chi Minh City plant that Coke built before the Vietnam War and in a new bottling plant in Hanoi.
Coke also has an interest in a Cambodian soft-drinks company, based in Phnom Penh.
