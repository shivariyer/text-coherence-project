Quidel Corp., San Diego, expects to report results "between break-even and a two-cent-a-share loss" for its third quarter ended Dec. 31, said Scott L. Glenn, chairman and chief executive officer.
In the year-ago quarter, Quidel earned $285,000, or two cents a share, on sales of $7.5 million.
Analysts had forecast earnings of between two cents and three cents a share for the latest quarter.
Mr. Glenn said the lower-than-expected earnings are due in part to disappointing sales of its strep-throat diagnostic product, "QTest Strep," its top-selling item.
He said the late and mild winter in the East depressed sales.
In addition, the executive said that because chain retail drugstores enjoyed a strong Christmas season, Quidel's one-step test -- introduced just six months ago -- wasn't allotted shelf space at many drugstores.
Quidel develops and produces noninstrumental diagnostic tests for physicians, clinical laboratories and the home-testing market.
