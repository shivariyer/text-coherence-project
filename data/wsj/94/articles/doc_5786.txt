President Clinton and congressional leaders selected a 32-member commission to study ways to reduce government spending on benefit programs.
Mr. Clinton appointed 10 members of the 32-person Commission on Entitlement Reform, to be headed by Democratic Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska and Republican Sen. John Danforth of Missouri.
Entitlements are programs that pay benefits to anyone who qualifies.
The panel's toughest issue will be dealing with the Social Security system, which is expensive, but usually is considered a sacred cow.
Administration officials have suggested it is unlikely that Social Security would be changed much.
The Kerrey Commission, as it is known, may have some fiery days ahead.
Among its members are liberals, such as Bob Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget Priorities, and conservatives such as Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan Simpson.
Mr. Clinton said the commission will "grapple with real issues of entitlement reforms, not caps or gimmicks that defer hard choices, but specific and constructive proposals."
The commission will issue a report to the White House later this year.
