In an effort to bolster its derivatives business, Salomon Brothers Inc. hired Richard Klotz away from Merrill Lynch & Co. to become director of its fixed-income derivatives research operation, a new position.
Mr. Klotz resigned as head of mortgage-backed securities research at Merrill Lynch on Friday.
Merrill Lynch said it had no immediate plans to replace the former managing director and declined to elaborate on Mr. Klotz's departure.
Salomon Brothers, a unit of Salomon Inc., said Mr. Klotz will report to Tom Klaffky, managing director in charge of bond portfolio analysis.
A spokesman for Salomon said Mr. Klotz will begin work on Monday.
"His experience in a wide variety of fixed-income securities, including derivatives, allows us to integrate derivatives research into the mainstream of our overall fixed-income business," a Salomon Brothers spokesman said.
"It's unfortunate that Merrill Lynch lost someone of his caliber," said Steven Lazarus, an executive recruiter with Mariaschin & Co.
"He should enhance the company's derivatives operations because of his strong background in research."
Mr. Klotz also brings a potent statistical and theoretical background to Salomon, including extensive academic training in mathematics.
As derivatives become increasingly arcane, analysts believe that academic and mathematical expertise will become more highly prized.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley Group Inc. hired William Levy, 36 years old, as vice president in its global derivatives group.
Mr. Levy, who resigned from Kidder, Peabody & Co. last week, will be responsible for distribution of over-the-counter equity products.
A Morgan Stanley spokesman said Mr. Levy would focus his attention on marketing timely customized options, swaps and baskets to the firm's clients.
Kidder Peabody is a unit of General Electric Co.
