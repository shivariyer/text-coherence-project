Cott Corp. said it reached a supply agreement with Royal Crown Cola, securing a long-term source of concentrate for Cott's private-label soft drinks worldwide.
Under the 21-year agreement, Royal Crown, a unit of Triarc Cos., of Miami Beach, Fla., will be the exclusive supplier for all cola concentrates used in Cott's retailer-branded soft drinks.
Cott, a Mississauga, Ontario, private-label soft-drink concern, also agreed to purchase at least 75% of its world-wide requirements for all types of concentrates from Royal Crown.
Under the pact, Royal Crown won't supply concentrate to other private-label softdrink companies.
Separately, Cott said it acquired a 51% stake in the canning operation of Benjamin Shaw & Sons Ltd., the soft-drink unit of Rutland Trust PLC of the United Kingdom, for about US$9 million, with options to acquire the entire operation next year.
Cott said the canning plant has annual sales of more than $60 million.
