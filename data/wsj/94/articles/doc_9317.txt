A consumer health group urged the Food and Drug Administration to warn patients with the fracture-prone Bjork-Shiley artificial heart valve that the device may be "far more dangerous" than previously believed.
Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, wrote to FDA Commissioner David Kessler.
His letter cited findings by Dutch physicians that there are "extremely high failure rates" of the Bjork-Shiley Convexo-Concave, or C-C, valves.
About 50,000 people are believed to have the valve.
The Dutch study, described in a recent issue of the British medical journal Lancet, involved only 24 valves, but researchers said patients were randomly selected in an "unbiased" way after it was found that for various reasons the valve should be removed.
There have been almost 400 total failures of the device reported to the FDA of which about two-thirds of the patients died.
Findings of the study suggest the possibility that the valves may fracture at a significantly higher rate than reported in earlier studies.
This could alter cardiologists' views about whether the risks of the device outweigh the risks of surgery to remove them.
New York-based Pfizer Inc., maker of the valve, said in a statement that it has discussed the Dutch findings with the FDA and that "no changes in patient care were recommended."
The company withdrew the valve from the market in 1986.
Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer common closed at $68.25, off 37.5 cents.
The Lancet article said Dutch doctors surgically removed 24 valves, subjected them to metallurgical analysis, and found that seven had a fracture in one of two wire-like "legs" that comprise a valve part called a strut.
Researchers have concluded that such a failure could curtail the flow of blood.
