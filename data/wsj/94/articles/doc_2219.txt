Citizens Inc. said it expects today to post fourth-quarter net income of $1.6 million, or 10 cents a share, exceeding analysts' estimates.
A year earlier, the company earned $563,000, or three cents a share, after a charge of $264,000, or two cents a share, on an accounting change.
In an interview, Harold E. Riley, chairman and chief executive of the Austin, Texas, life-insurance holding company, said revenue rose 32% to $13.5 million, from $10.2 million.
Analysts expected Citizens to post net income of about seven cents a share, said Mark Oliver, the company's chief financial officer.
Mr. Riley attributed the improved results to continued growth in sales of its ordinary whole-life insurance policies to customers in developing countries who have high net worth.
He predicted revenue will grow 20% to 30% in 1994.
CITIZENS Inc. said it earned $809,000, or five cents a share, for the fourth quarter of 1992 after a charge of $23,000, or one cent a share, for an accounting change.
The company revised the figures it had supplied for an article Tuesday after consulting with its accountants on how to book the accounting change.
