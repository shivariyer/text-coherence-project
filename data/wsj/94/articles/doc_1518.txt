Juergen Schrempp has been tapped to succeed Edzard Reuter as chairman of Daimler-Benz AG next year, according to a report to be published today in the German magazine Der Spiegel.
Mr. Schrempp, 49 years old, is currently chairman of the Daimler subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace AG and has frequently been mentioned as a likely candidate to succeed Mr. Reuter, who is due to retire in 1995 at the age of 67.
Daimler officials couldn't be reached for comment on the report by Spiegel, advance copies of which were made available to news organizations over the weekend.
Deutsche Aerospace officials would neither confirm nor deny the contents of the report.
The question of Mr. Reuter's successor has long been a topic of hot speculation because of the possible implications for a strategic reorganization of Daimler when Mr. Reuter's tenure ends.
Once hailed as a star among German industrialists, Mr. Reuter has increasingly come under criticism for leading Daimler down a path of extensive diversification.
Spending over eight billion marks ($4.74 billion) for acquisitions, Mr. Reuter transformed Daimler from a sharply focused and highly profitable maker of automobiles to a sprawling technology conglomerate with products ranging from refrigerators to satellites, fighter bombers and passenger cars.
The strategy has led to steadily slumping results at the company.
According to Der Spiegel, Mr. Reuter's retirement as management board chairman will not, however, put an end to his strategy.
The outgoing chairman is slated to take over as chairman of the supervisory board next year -- a position currently held by Deutsche Bank AG management board spokesman Hilmar Kopper.
That would enable Mr. Reuter to keep control over the strategic direction of the company.
