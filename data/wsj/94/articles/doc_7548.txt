Royal Crown Cola Co., a unit of Triarc Cos., created four new management positions aimed at revitalizing the soft-drink maker.
John C. Carson, Royal Crown president and chief executive, said the new management team is aimed at improving the company's relations with its bottlers, which analysts said have been a weak link in operations.
The Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company also said it will launch a $10 million advertising campaign.
Chief Financial Officer Kenneth A. Thomas, 40, was named to the additional post of senior vice president of business information systems and human resources.
Jerry Will, 44, was named senior vice-president for business development.
He previously was president and chief operating officer of Premium Beverages Inc., a soft-drink unit of the Seagram Co. of Montreal.
Alan Leyland, 53 years old, was named senior vice president of operations, responsible for Royal Crown's concentrate operations, its U.S. franchise bottler network and private-label business.
Mr. Leyland, most recently a private consultant, previously was president of Canadian bottler Lakelands Beverages.
Donald Lenehan, 41, was named senior vice president of marketing.
He formerly was vice president of marketing for Cable News Network and Headline News, units of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. of Atlanta.
Jerry Smith, 49, will continue as president of the international group.
