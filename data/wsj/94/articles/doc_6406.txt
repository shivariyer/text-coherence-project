President Clinton will hold an international jobs summit in Detroit next month to tackle the global problem of persistently high unemployment, the White House announced.
The March 14-15 conference will bring together economic, labor, finance and industry ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized democracies -- the U.S., Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, France and Britain.
The conference "will send a message that we intend to confront the challenge of job creation and unemployment, not retreat to the economic structures of yesterday," the White House announcement said.
During a G-7 meeting last July in Tokyo, Mr. Clinton announced his intention to convene such a conference.
He said then the G-7 officials would "search for the causes and possible answers for this stubbornly high unemployment."
The president originally hoped to hold the meeting last fall, but it was pushed into 1994 by the crush of other items on his first-year agenda.
