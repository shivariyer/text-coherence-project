Struggling past midnight, the Senate passed President Clinton's education overhaul bill in time to save states and schools $105 million this year.
The Goals 2000 bill, passed 63-22 early Saturday, authorizes $647 million for school programs nationwide, including $400 million in grants to states and local school agencies.
The vote came after Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) organized a filibuster over the rewording of a school prayer provision.
But the tactic, which delayed the start of a two-week Easter recess, ended after Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) threatened to bring senators back after the weekend if necessary to vote on the bill.
Sen. Helms didn't show up for the final hours of talk or the vote.
The urgency to pass the bill was the result of a provision that would have subtracted $105 million in funding for states and local school districts this year if the measure didn't become law by April 1.
Congress doesn't return from vacation until April 11.
