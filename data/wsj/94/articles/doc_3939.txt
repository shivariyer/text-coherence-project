Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it agreed to purchase Norden Systems Inc. from United Technologies Corp., Hartford, Conn.
Terms of the pact weren't disclosed.
Westinghouse characterized the purchase of the radar and air-traffic control concern as part of its previously announced plan to build certain core businesses.
At the same time, Westinghouse has been involved in a divestiture plan, including about $1.45 billion in asset sales thus far this year.
Norden, with about 1,600 employees and $220 million in annual sales, will become part of Westinghouse Electronic Systems, which is involved in radar, electronic surveillance, air-traffic control and command and control systems.
Baltimore-based Westinghouse Electronic Systems has about $2.6 billion in annual sales and about 14,000 employees.
According to Westinghouse, Norden will provide a new set of customers and a complementary set of products, including a different type of air-traffic control system.
"Norden's longtime domestic and international involvement in airborne and shipboard radar systems, as well as antisubmarine warfare systems, will help strengthen our position in the military-electronics area," said Richard A. Lindner, president of Westinghouse Electronics Systems.
United Technologies tried to sell its Norden unit in the late 1980s.
But after a 16-month effort to peddle the division, which had losses of more than $300 million in the mid-1980s, United Technologies pulled the firm off the market.
Various restructuring efforts have slashed employment levels from 3,800 in 1989.
The radar unit also was implicated in a Pentagon influence-peddling scandal in the 1980s.
United Technologies settled the allegations by pleading guilty and paying a $6 million fine in August 1992.
Yesterday, a United Technologies spokesman called the Pentagon case "ancient history."
Westinghouse said it expects the transaction, subject to U.S. antitrust review, to be completed in the second quarter.
