Auspex Systems Inc. said International Business Machines Corp. will no longer fund further enhancements to a computer designed by Auspex for IBM.
In a letter to the Santa Clara, Calif., company, IBM cited "the current business environment and investment factors" in its decision.
Auspex said IBM plans to keep selling the machine, but did not say for how long.
Auspex said it did not expect a major financial impact from IBM's decision, since the computer, called the RS7051 file-server, has not sold well and consequently has not brought in significant royalty revenue to Auspex.
Separately, Auspex named Laurence Boucher, the company's chief executive officer, to the additional post of chairman.
He succeeds Jim Patterson, who retired at the beginning of this year.
Auspex also said it plans to begin a stock repurchase program to buy as many as 600,000 shares of stock in the open market.
Mr. Boucher said the move was made in view of the recent low price of the company's stock.
Auspex shares were unchanged yesterday at $8.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
The stock's 52-week high was $15.50.
