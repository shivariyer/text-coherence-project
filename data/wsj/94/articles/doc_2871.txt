Boddie-Noell Restaurant Properties Inc. said it withdrew from a planned acquisition of 10 apartment properties and three retail shopping centers.
The real estate investment trust last May said it would acquire the properties for $22 million plus the assumption of $103.4 million in debt.
The company said it called off the deal because of apartment-market improvements, which likely would cause the properties' owners not to approve the transaction.
