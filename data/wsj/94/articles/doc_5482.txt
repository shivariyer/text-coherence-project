Spain's high court ruled to admit a suit brought by the Kuwait Investment Office against seven of its former employees.
Friday's ruling came in response to an appeal filed by the KIO after the court's judge for monetary affairs rejected the suit four times last year on the grounds that it didn't provide enough evidence of the alleged crimes.
The KIO claims that former executives of Grupo Torras SA, the KIO's Spanish holding company, lost or diverted more than 100 billion pesetas ($702.5 million) of Kuwaiti investments in Spain between 1986 and 1992.
According to the KIO, Torras was forced into receivership in December 1992 because of gross mismanagement by its executives, a crime the judge for monetary affairs said wasn't included in Spain's penal code.
But the high court said in a writ that the crimes alleged in the suit-falsification of mercantile and public documents, price manipulation, fraud and tax evasion"are sufficiently documented, with the designation of people, dates, places and volumes that have been evaded for an estimated total of more than 100 billion pesetas."
Lawyers for the KIO first filed a 114-page suit against its former executives in January 1993, naming as defendants Fahd al-Sabah, former chairman of the KIO and Torras; Fouad Jaffar, the KIO's former general manager who resigned in early 1990; and Javier de la Rosa, the former deputy chairman of Torras until his resignation in May 1992.
The other four defendants were Spanish executives of Torras and close collaborators of Mr. de la Rosa from 1986 to 1992.
The KIO, which claims it lost $5 billion on its investments in Spain, has sought to reduce its presence there since Grupo Torras suspended payments on its 243 billion pesetas of debt.
Of the KIO's four principal units in the chemical, food, real-estate and paper sectors, only the sugar company Ebro Agricolas Cia. de Alimentacion has made a profit in the past two years.
