Metallgesellschaft Corp., a unit of Metallgesellschaft AG, has arranged for up to $300 million of new liquidity to be provided by its creditor banks under a new secured credit facility.
The company said in a statement that in conjunction with the new facility, it agreed with most of its banks to a 90-day standstill period, during which it will seek to restructure its outstanding credit facilities.
