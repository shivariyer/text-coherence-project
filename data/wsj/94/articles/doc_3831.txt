NEC Corp. says it is close to an agreement with Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea to jointly develop a new generation of 256-megabit memory chips.
An NEC spokesman said the negotiations to produce the new DRAM, or dynamic random access memory, semiconductor may be concluded as early as this month.
An accord would mark the first time chip makers from these two countries would jointly develop advanced chip technologies, although there have been other ventures between South Korean and Japanese chip makers.
NEC is the world's second-largest chip maker, while Samsung is the leading maker of the most advanced memory chips currently sold.
The talks between the two companies are the latest sign of increased international cooperation in chip development that in recent years has also included U.S. and European producers.
The NEC spokesman said that by joining forces, the two companies hope to reduce the risks involved in chip development.
The cost of developing the new chip may run as high as $1 billion.
