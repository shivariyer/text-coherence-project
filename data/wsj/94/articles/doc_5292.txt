Admiral Frank Kelso II, the Navy's top uniformed officer, announced early retirement yesterday, seeking to close the book on the Tailhook scandal in which Naval aviators at a party acted lewdly and aggressively with the women present.
While a military judge criticized Kelso's involvement with Tailhook, another report by the same Pentagon investigator who earlier had detailed the scandal -- causing the dismissal of senior officers -- found "no credible evidence" of Kelso's personal involvement.
Still, he's gone.
Last April, Attorney General Janet Reno was acclaimed a hero for assuming full responsibility for the federal assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, in which 25 children and some 50 adults died.
A government report absolved Ms. Reno of any wrongdoing.
She stayed on.
Tailhook's critics will argue that rough justice or no, Admiral Kelso had it coming.
But if the same people also rationalize why official favorites responsible for other political disasters aren't subject to the Kelso standard for exile, then their rough justice may breed mostly public cynicism.
