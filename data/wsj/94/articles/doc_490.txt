Armco Inc. said it will temporarily shut down its Empire-Detroit Steel division, forcing a layoff 1,300 workers and a first-quarter charge of $20 million, or 19 cents a share.
The Parsippany, N.J., specialty steelmaker said it opted to idle the division after a main motor drive in its "blooming mill" failed, adding to the unit's substantial losses.
A blooming mill processes ingots into slabs.
Empire-Detroit already was losing money due to a high-cost manufacturing process and to higher prices for scrap, a raw material.
Armco, which has 6,600 employees, is building a low-cost, thin-slab continuous caster at the division's Mansfield, Ohio, mill.
That caster will make slabs directly from hot metal, skipping the ingot step.
When the caster is complete, in mid-1995, Armco plans to recall about 250 workers for training and could recall another 600 as the unit develops new business.
The shutdown is to begin May 29.
