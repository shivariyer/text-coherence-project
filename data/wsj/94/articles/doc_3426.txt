Measurex Corp. said softness in Asian and South American markets caused orders in the first quarter ended Feb. 27 to decline 9% to $31 million from $34 million a year ago.
Despite the sales decline, the maker of computerized manufacturing controls said it expects profit to be "somewhat higher" than the year-ago period's 10 cents a share.
