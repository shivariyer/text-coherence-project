Courtaulds Textiles PLC announced that its proposed #45 million ($66.4 million) acquisition of Hartstone Group PLC's hosiery and sock business has been delayed because of damage at one of the plants.
The British textile group said that bad weather in France had caused damage to one of the buildings at a warehouse and packaging site, and that it is waiting to see how badly the building has been damaged before completing the purchase.
