Great Western Financial Corp. posted a narrower fourth-quarter loss, its second consecutive quarterly deficit, as it continues to dispose of problem assets and slash overhead.
The fourth-quarter net loss at the nation's second-largest thrift shrank to $18.2 million, or 19 cents a share, from $97.3 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier.
The results include loan-loss provisions of $149 million and charges of $30 million for a restructuring, in which 500 people, or about 14% of its headquarters staff, will be laid off, the company said.
Analysts had expected the company to earn 29 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
In New York Stock Exchange trading, the company's stock closed at 19.25, up 37.5 cents, apparently on speculation that the company was putting its problems behind it.
In 1993, Great Western sold some $1.6 billion in distressed property and loans, which helped reduce nonperforming assets to $1.13 billion, or 2.9% of assets, from $2.01 billion, or 5.12% of assets, at the end of 1992.
That purge, which some analysts said was overdue, still leaves the thrift holding more bad assets than its peers.
At H.F. Ahmanson & Co., its larger crosstown rival, problem assets are 2.08% of total assets.
At Golden West Financial Corp., widely considered the nation's best-run thrift, the level is 1.5%.
The expected layoffs, which arise from a cost-cutting drive announced last August, are primarily in administrative functions.
No further layoffs are planned, the spokesman said.
