British Telecommunications PLC is reshuffling its senior management to speed the growth of its businesses abroad.
The dominant U.K. phone company said it's creating a new division to oversee its growing international investments, including its planned 20% stake in MCI Communications Inc., the big U.S. long-distance carrier.
Last June BT announced a sweeping trans-Atlantic alliance with MCI, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion for the MCI stake and to form a 75%-BT, 25%-MCI joint venture offering international business-communications services.
The alliance has yet to be finalized, largely because of some anticipated delays getting clearance from U.S. regulatory authorities, a BT spokesman said.
Named to run BT's new Global Communications Division was Alfred Mockett, 45 years old, currently managing director of BT's business-communications division.
The new division groups together several previously separate BT units for, among other things, operations in Europe and Asia and for its Syntegra computer-services business.
Mr. Mockett will report to BT Managing Director Michael Hepher, and will also be one of BT's representatives on MCI's board, when the share purchase is completed later this year.
At the same time, BT said it's creating a new National Business Communications division to handle its U.K. business services.
That unit is to be headed by Bruce Bond, 47, currently in charge of BT's communications-products division.
The changes, which London financial analysts called an expected attempt to focus more management attention on foreign growth, leave BT with three main operating divisions -- the new global and national business units, plus BT's existing U.K. residential-telephone services division.
Since BT's privatization in 1984 -- it was formerly the U.K.'s state-owned telephone monopoly -- the company has tried and failed at several different methods of becoming a global force in telecommunications.
