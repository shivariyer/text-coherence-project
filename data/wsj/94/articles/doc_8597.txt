In a desperate attempt to control escalating violence here, Mayor Cesar Maia issued a decree prohibiting the manufacture and sale of guns and ammunition.
"We must disarm the population of Rio de Janeiro.
What we have most in Rio are arms," he told a news conference.
"We hope state and federal governments will take similar measures to suppress the sale and circulation of arms."
City officials will meet with mayors of neighboring towns tomorrow to urge them to adopt similar measures.
Police have fought a series of bloody battles with drug traffickers in Rio's shantytowns in recent months, uncovering arsenals of sophisticated weapons, many smuggled in from the U.S. and other countries.
To protect themselves against crime, more and more Rio residents are buying guns, studies show.
According to the police, sales of firearms rose to 15,645 in 1993 from 14,768 in 1992, the O Dia newspaper reported.
The city issued 757 licenses last year, up from 404 in 1992.
