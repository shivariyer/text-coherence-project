Should Dallas Cowboys fans thank American Medical Electronics Inc.?
The Richardson maker of medical devices has been promoting its role in Cowboy defensive tackle Leon Lett's recovery from a broken ankle.
That didn't look like anything to brag about when Mr. Lett's blunder on a blocked field goal cost his team the Miami game, before a national TV audience on Thanksgiving.
But on Sunday, he was named a player of the game in Dallas's playoff win over Green Bay.
AME's role goes back to September, when Mr. Lett reinjured an ankle he had broken before.
The team's medical staff had him try an AME ankle bracelet, which emits a weak electromagnetic field to stimulate bone growth.
After wearing it 14 to 16 hours a day for eight weeks, he returned to action.
"We weren't sure he'd be up and running, let alone playing, by the eighth week," says team trainer Kevin O'Neal.
Now, if AME can develop something to help stimulate recall of NFL rules on when not to touch a live football . . .
