Amway Japan Ltd. said it established Amway Japan Enterprises Inc., a U.S. unit that will invest the Japan-based parent's cash "primarily" in U.S. securities.
Amway Japan, an independent, publicly traded company spun off from privately held direct seller Amway Corp. in 1991, said it will provide as much as $300 million in investment capital to the unit.
