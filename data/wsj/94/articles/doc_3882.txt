A federal judge granted convicted banker Christopher P. Drogoul immunity from further prosecution so he can testify before a grand jury investigating his former employer, an Italian bank, his attorney said.
U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell signed the order giving immunity to Mr. Drogoul, a major figure in the case involving $5 billion in loans to Iraq by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
"Apparently they have convened a grand jury at least in Atlanta, which is scheduled to commence tomorrow morning," Mr. Drogoul's attorney, Robert M. Simels, said.
Prosecutors say Iraq used at least some of the money, obtained under a U.S. government program to help finance agricultural exports, to buy weapons before its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Mr.DDrogoul pleaded guilty to wire fraud and submitting false reports to bank regulators.
He is currently serving the final months of a 37-month prison term.
