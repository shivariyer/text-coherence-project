A new $19 million computer system is expected to improve Medicare service and eventually save the federal program more than $200 million a year in administrative costs, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala announced.
The Medicare Transaction System is to begin operating in late 1996 and be fully phased in by 1998.
When fully phased in, data regarding eligibility, other insurance coverage and prior claims will be available to health-care providers instantaneously, Ms. Shalala said.
Medicare is the federal health-care insurance program for the elderly and the disabled, and serves 36 million beneficiaries.
GTE Government Systems Corp. of Chantilly, Va., a unit of GTE Corp., was awarded a six-year contract to design and develop the new system, Ms. Shalala said at a news conference.
Under the new system, Medicare recipients would present a Medicare card for their care.
The card would allow a doctor to electronically submit the claim to Medicare and be paid automatically, Ms. Shalala said.
Medicare beneficiaries will receive a copy of their bill and a central number to call for questions.
In addition, a patient's Medigap insurer would be billed instantaneously as well.
Medigap policies cover medical costs not covered by Medicare.
Bruce Vladeck, administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, said the new computer network also may help federal officials detect fraud and abuse in the Medicare system.
Currently, 79 different contractors across the country use 14 different processing systems at 62 different locations to process Medicare claims.
Once the new system is in full operation, those contractors will focus on other issues with Medicare recipients, such as customer service, Ms. Shalala said.
