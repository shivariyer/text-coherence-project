Bowing to a weak economy, IG Metall, Germany's largest union yesterday unveiled a modest strategy of selective and small-scale strikes to counter demands for wage cuts in the 1994 contract.
If its "soft" strike tactics don't advance the wage talks, however, IG Metall also threatened to escalate its walkout throughout most of northern Germany, union officials said yesterday.
Two weeks still remain to avert a strike.
Union president Klaus Zwickel said the union will be ready to begin a strike on Monday March 7.
In its first formal steps toward a full-blown strike, the union yesterday announced that wage talks have collapsed and that it will hold a strike vote in Lower Saxony, which is one of western Germany's industrially less important regions.
Polling in the district will run from March 1-3.
IG Metall typically concentrates its strikes in selected districts and won't hold a nationwide walkout.
If talks don't move ahead by March 15, the union will begin a second strike vote in the larger district that includes Hamburg, Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein.
If that vote is approved, a strike could begin in that second district on March 21, Zwickel said at a press briefing at the union's Frankfurt headquarters.
