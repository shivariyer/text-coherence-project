The brother of Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media tycoon and leader of a new conservative political movement, was arrested Friday on corruption charges.
Paolo Berlusconi, implicated in a scandal involving Italy's largest savings bank, Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde, or Cariplo, was accused of paying a kickback of more than one billion lire ($592,000) to political parties, Italian news reports said.
He turned himself in to police for questioning, state-run TV said.
He argues that any money paid out was for normal middleman fees and not kickbacks to parties.
Earlier this month, Silvo Berlusconi announced he was entering politics and running candidates under the banner Forza Italia (Go Italy) in parliamentary elections March 27 to 28.
The media tycoon holds himself up as an alternative to a political class discredited by Italy's two-year-old corruption scandal.
Paolo Berlusconi has been closely associated with his brother in business dealings, although in recent years he claimed his business affairs were no longer connected with his brother's company, Fininvest.
