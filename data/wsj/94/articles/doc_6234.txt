The insured property damage caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake will amount to $2.5 billion, according to the insurance industry's official scorekeeper.
The Property Claims Service division of the American Insurance Group, which tracks insurance losses on behalf of the industry, expects 230,000 claims eventually will result from the California disaster.
Most of the damage was in the San Fernando Valley.
The estimate doesn't include losses for uninsured property.
"Approximately 33% of homeowners in the affected area have earthquake coverage," said Gary Kerney, an A.I.G. executive who helped assemble the data.
"Commercial property has a slightly higher rate of coverage."
At $2.5 billion, the earthquake would rank as the third worst natural disaster in the past several years, coming after hurricanes Andrew and Hugo.
