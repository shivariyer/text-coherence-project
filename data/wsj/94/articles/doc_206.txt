Pyramid Technology Corp., San Jose, Calif., said an expected 15% drop in revenue during the fiscal second quarter would result in a "significant" loss for the period.
The computer-technology company attributed the expected results to a decline in business from the year-earlier quarter when it earned $1.4 million, or 12 cents a share, on revenue of $58 million.
For the current quarter ending tomorrow, analysts had expected the company to report earnings of four cents to 12 cents a share.
Pyramid's announcement came after the close of major financial markets.
Its shares closed at $11.75, down 75 cents, or 6%, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
