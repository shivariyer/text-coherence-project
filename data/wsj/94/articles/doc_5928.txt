Hospital Staffing Services Inc. said, in response to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing made by a shareholder group led by NuMed Home Health Care Inc., that the ongoing base of its business "remains sound."
A group led by NuMed, based in Independence, Ohio, said in the filing that it is seeking to oust a majority of the directors of Hospital Staffing and ultimately remove some of the company's senior managers.
In a Jan. 18 letter to the company, the NuMed group cited what it called the "extremely poor performance of Hospital Staffing under its current management."
Hospital Staffing, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., countered that it is "continuing to move forward with programs aimed at restoring long-term growth, improving our operating results and increasing shareholder value."
