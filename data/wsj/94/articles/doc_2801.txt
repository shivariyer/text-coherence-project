Hearst Corp. said Ronald A. Galotti, named publishing director of Esquire and Esquire Gentleman just six weeks ago, quit to return to his previous employer, Conde Nast.
Mr. Galotti, 44 years old, left his job as publisher of Conde Nast's Vanity Fair in May.
At the time there were rumors that Mr. Galotti clashed with executives at Conde Nast, a unit of the Newhouse family's Advance Publications Inc.
Mr. Galotti's post at Esquire, marked his return to Hearst magazines, where he was founding publisher of Country Living, launched in 1982.
A Hearst spokeswoman said Mr. Galotti didn't specify what job he will assume at Conde Nast, and insiders there said they didn't know either.
It is speculated that Mr. Galotti will take a corporate job rather than the publishing post at a single publication.
Mr. Galotti couldn't be reached immediately for comment.
