Fiat SpA plunged into the red last year for the first time since 1979, with a loss of about 1.8 trillion lire ($1.06 billion), Chairman Giovanni Agnelli said in a letter to shareholders.
The Italian auto maker also said it plans to issue a one trillion-lire, 10-year fixed-rate bond coordinated by Milan merchant bank Mediobanca.
The issue comes on the heels of a five trillion lire capital increase announced in September, which is intended to update its aging model line and pay down debt.
Analysts said the preliminary result is in line with most expectations and is better than the worst predictions of a 1993 loss of as much as 2.1 trillion lire.
Fiat reported net income of 551 billion lire in 1992.
While Mr. Agnelli himself stopped short of predicting a turnaround in 1994, he said demand should pick up, warning that any recovery would be slow.
"What's for certain is that 1993 was the bottom for Fiat and we expect to see a strong improvement in 1994, even if a break-even target will be very difficult," said Fausto Galleotti, director of research at Pasfin securities in Milan.
Consolidated sales declined 1.9% to 53.7 trillion lire from 54.607 trillion lire in 1992.
Sales figures were adjusted to take into account Fiat's sale of a controlling stake in the Rinascente SpA department store chain in October to Agnelli holding company Ifil Finanziaria di Partecipazioni SpA.
Fiat blamed the results on the prolonged crisis in the European and Italian car markets.
Car sales declined 15% in Europe last year and 20% in Italy, while the market for industrial vehicles fell for the fourth consecutive year by 22% in Europe.
As a result, Fiat's Iveco truck subsidiary suffered a 21% decline in sales, Mr. Agnelli said.
As part of ongoing restructuring efforts, Fiat is in the midst of intense labor negotiations to lay off 5,000 employees permanently and 7,000 to 10,000 on a temporary basis.
The car division, which has banked its future on updating its model list, introduced its new Punto city car in September, and a sports coupe will follow.
Fiat Auto's Chief Executive Officer Paolo Cantarella said the company expects to sell 500,000 Puntos in Europe in 1994.
"Their strategy called for new models and it remains to be seen whether they're going to be successful," said Enrico Ponzone, Italy analyst with Kleinwort Benson in London.
"Their track record in that area is not very good."
