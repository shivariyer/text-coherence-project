The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved a bill giving loans to state and local governments to clean up drinking water, while easing the impact of federal-water rules on small communities.
The bill, cleared by a 17-0 vote, would create a $6.6 billion loan fund to help states finance improvements in water systems that are required to comply with federal drinking-water standards.
The fund is modeled after one established by the Clean Water Act, which applies to rivers and streams.
The bill wouldn't require utilities serving 10,000 people or fewer to comply with standards set by 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, which small communities have complained are too strict.
The bill doesn't go as far in relaxing the federal-water rules as the Clinton administration had proposed.
A coalition of local governments and water utilities said yesterday that it doesn't offer the Environmental Protection Agency enough flexibility in considering the risk of various contaminants.
But environmental groups said it weakens protection against cancer-causing chemicals and other contaminants, for water systems serving as many as 40 million people.
The Sierra Club, an environmental group, said the bill puts "Americans at risk, especially pregnant women, infants and children, the elderly and chronically ill."
The bill now goes to the full Senate for approval.
Similar legislation has been introduced in the House, but there hasn't yet been any committee action.
