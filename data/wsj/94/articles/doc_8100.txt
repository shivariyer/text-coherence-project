Jean Philippe Fragrances Inc. signed a letter of intent to purchase certain productline trademarks from Cosmetiques et Parfums de France I.D. in a cash and stock transaction valued at about $5.8 million.
Jean Philippe in New York would buy the Paris-based company's Parfums Molyneux and Parfums Weil lines for $3.4 million and 200,000 Jean Philippe common shares.
It also intends to buy the product lines' inventory at cost, an estimated $3 million, a spokesman said.
Jean Philippe stock closed at $11.25 a share, down 25 cents, in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The trademarks cover moderately priced fragrances distributed in more than 30 countries.
They generated about $13 million in sales last year.
Jean Philippe plans to use the product lines to expand internationally through its Inter Parfums unit.
Chairman Jean Madar said he expects to see "benefits of additional sales and earnings in 1994" from the purchase.
