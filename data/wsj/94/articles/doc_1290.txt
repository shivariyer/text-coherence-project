There won't soon be a liquid market for shares of TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. after all.
The international food company, which is controlled by the family of the late Reginald F. Lewis, said minority shareholders have withdrawn a demand that it register their shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Such registration would have paved the way for broad secondary trading in shares of the company, which is the leading distributor of dry groceries, beverages and household products to supermarkets in the region around Paris, among other businesses.
For the first nine months, it reported net income of $10.5 million, or $1.14 a share, on sales of $1.27 billion.
TLC Beatrice had filed a registration statement with the SEC last December on behalf of the minority shareholders.
But the document never became effective, the spokesman said.
Currently, only very thin private trading between institutional holders occurs in Beatrice shares, a company spokesman said.
No minority shareholders could be reached for comment.
Beatrice also said it has sold its corporate aircraft and slashed its headquarters staff to about 15 employees, from about 30, as part of a companywide cost-cutting program.
