Moorco International Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Fischer & Porter Co. in a transaction valued at approximately $150 million.
The acquisition will allow Moorco, a Houston supplier of fluid-measurement and pressure-control products for the energy industry, to diversify.
Fischer & Porter also makes measurement and control products, but its goods have no application to the petroleum industry.
Both companies said that about 65% of their sales are international.
For the six months ended Nov. 30, Moorco had net income of $5.8 million, or 48 cents a share, on revenue of $99 million.
For the year ended Dec. 31, Fischer & Porter had net of $1.1 million, or 19 cents a share, on sales of $220 million.
The acquisition still requires several approvals, including that of Fischer & Porter's board, before it becomes final.
MOORCO INTERNATIONAL Inc.'s proposed acquisition of Fischer & Porter Co. requires the approval of Fischer & Porter shareholders.
An article Monday incorrectly reported that the acquisition needs board approval.
