USX Corp., Pittsburgh, said it approved a 12% lower capital, investment and exploration budget for its Marathon Group unit for 1994 in hopes that lower spending will help reduce debt and improve the company's financial profile.
USX, a steel, petroleum and naturalgas concern, approved a budget of $895 million, down from the $1.01 billion spent in 1993, the company said.
It noted that the decrease primarily results from the substantial completion of three multiyear projects.
Marathon's capital budget of $752 million includes $496 million for production activities; $246 million for refining, marketing and transportation; and $10 million for other expenditures.
Its world-wide exploration budget of $143 million includes $84 million for international activities.
