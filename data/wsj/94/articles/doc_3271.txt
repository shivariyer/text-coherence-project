Fluor Corp.'s Fluor Daniel unit received a contract from British units of Chevron Corp. and DuPont Co. valued at more than $330 million to help develop the Britannica gas field in the U.K. North Sea.
Fluor will provide engineering, procurement and construction-management services to build an onshore gas-processing plant for a joint venture between Chevron U.K. Ltd. and Conoco U.K. Ltd.
The project is scheduled to be completed in late 1998.
