Columbia Real Estate Investments Inc., Columbia, Md., said it negotiated the sales of most of its assets and has pending contracts on the balance.
The company, whose dissolution and liquidation plan was approved by shareholders last week, said it believes that if all the sales are completed, shareholders should receive about $10 a share, somewhat higher than a previous estimate of $9 to $9.25.
Columbia said it expects that all the transactions will be completed "in the near future," and that a distribution of all or most of the liquidated value of the assets will be made in the next 45 to 60 days.
The company invests in residential mortgages and other mortgage derivative products.
