Sun Microsystems Inc. said fiscal second-quarter profit nearly doubled on an 8% increase in revenue, in line with analysts' expectations.
Net income for the period ended Dec. 26 was $43.8 million, or 46 cents a share, up 82% from $24.1 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier, when Sun was hit by product start-up costs and shortages.
Although the results were "a little lighter" than the 49 cents a share he hoped for, Salomon Brothers analyst Jeff Canin said he was pleased with Sun's gross margins for the quarter, which were 39%, up sharply from 23% a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $1.13 billion from $1.05 billion, and back orders reached record levels.
Sun cited high demand for new products, especially its new servers, high-end ZX and SX graphics workstations and Solaris software.
Separately, Sun said Michael Lehman, Sun's vice president and corporate controller, will assume the post of chief financial officer on March 1.
Mr. Lehman succeeds Kevin Melia who is moving to the East Coast for personal reasons.
Mr. Melia will continue to serve as acting president of its Sun Microsystems Computer Corp. unit until a successor is named, and as a member of Sun's executive management group.
In an interview, Mr. Melia, 44 years old, said he ruled out continuing as CFO from Boston because "it wouldn't be fair."
Even in this age of desktop video conferencing, executives need to make many of their decisions in "real time" face-to-face, and often informal meetings, he said.
Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy said he and Mr. Melia are "evaluating a number of opportunities for him to lead while living on the East Coast."
