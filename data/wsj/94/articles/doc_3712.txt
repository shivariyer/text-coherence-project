Times Mirror Co. said it acquired closely held Allen Communication Inc., a maker of computerized training programs.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Allen Communication, with 75 employees, makes its own training programs and so-called "authoring software" used to create interactive computer programs.
Times Mirror said it plans to use Allen Communication's software to make computerized versions of ordinary text and projection training materials now produced by various units of the Times Mirror Training Group of companies.
Los Angeles-based Times Mirror is a publisher of newspapers, including its flagship Los Angeles Times, as well as magazines and books.
The company also owns what it says is the nation's 10th-largest television cable business.
