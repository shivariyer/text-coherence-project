KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is reducing the number of operating divisions to two from three and tightening up lines of management.
The Dutch flag carrier said it will retain its passenger sales and service and cargo divisions, but eliminate its operations division.
KLM, based in Amstelveen, the Netherlands, said it is making the changes "to further increase the company's ability to respond rapidly and flexibly" to market developments.
The three-divisional organizational setup at KLM was established in 1990 with the intention to re-orientate the company "from a production-driven to a market and service-driven enterprise."
But a KLM spokeswoman said bundling various business units four years ago under the umbrella of an operations division didn't necessarily produce operating efficiencies.
Rather, with the removal of a layer of divisional management from over the various operating units such as technical services, flight operations and cabin crew departments, heads of such units now will report directly to the board.
KLM said it now plans to merge its cabin crew departments with flight operations to form a new non-divisional flight services business unit that will report directly to the board.
In the meantime, KLM said the passenger sales and services division and the cargo division are both meeting the company's original goal of bringing its operations closer to the client.
But at the passenger sales and services division, KLM said, it is eliminating the management position of senior vice president, field organization.
KLM said it will also concentrate its activities in network and scheduling development and fleet planning in one new department.
At present some of those activities are under passenger sales and services.
"This move will improve the company's ability to exploit opportunities in passenger and cargo markets in the short and long term," KLM said.
