Exxon Corp. said it has British government approval for a $260 million development of natural-gas reserves in two fields in the Sole Pit area of the southern North Sea.
Exxon and Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, each own a 50% interest in the project.
Exxon said initial production from the project will begin in October 1994.
