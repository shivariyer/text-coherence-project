Chairman Tony O'Reilly is facing a tough obstacle in his bid to extend his European newspaper interests to London.
Mr. O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers PLC, a Dublin publishing group, on Friday bought a 24.99% stake in Newspaper Publishing, owner of the London papers the Independent and the Independent on Sunday, for p18.4 million, ($27.1 million) or 350 pence a share.
Analysts saw the move as one thwarting a rival bid from a consortium led by Mirror Group Newspapers valued at #55.1 million, or 261.6 pence a share, for the 52.9% that it doesn't already own.
However, a spokesman for Mirror Group said the newspaper concern plans to make its offer directly to shareholders in a mailing over the next two weeks.
The Mirror Group consortium already owns a 47.1% stake in Newspaper Publishing.
If the Mirror Group offer succeeds, it could leave Mr. O'Reilly with an expensive stake in a company that he cannot control-or force him to make a bid for the whole company.
Mr. O'Reilly seems to have the upper hand, however.
Newspaper Publishing's board already signaled that it's willing to work with him.
The board is expected to meet with Mr. O'Reilly this week to discuss placing two of his representatives on the board.
Newspaper Publishing reiterated yesterday that Mirror Group's offer of 261 pence a share is "not satisfactory."
In the Independent's newsroom, Mr. Reilly was hailed as a white knight.
The Mirror consortium -- whose partners include the Italian and Spanish newspapers La Repubblica and El Pais, as well as the Independent's editor in chief -- had indicated it would cut costs and staff.
As many as 250 Independent jobs were said to be on the line.
Mr. O'Reilly, who purchased his stake from institutional investors, declined to comment.
A Mirror Group spokesman said that the consortium's offer of 261.6 pence a share still stands.
"We believe 350 a share is a pretty ripe price.
The 261 a share we've valued is realistic," the Mirror Group spokesman said.
