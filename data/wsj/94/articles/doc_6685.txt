Continuing its move into bigger cars aimed at aging baby boomers, Toyota Motor Corp. unveiled a new large sedan, the Avalon, which is to be built exclusively in Georgetown, Ky.
The new car is wider, longer and has more interior space than Toyota's previous biggest car, the Camry, and is aimed at holding onto customers who have outgrown the Camry.
Toyota said the Avalon will come equipped with standard dual air bags, automatic transmission, power windows and a 192-horsepower V-6 engine.
Toyota didn't announce the new car's price, but it is expected to fall between the $26,500 that the top-of-the-line Camry costs and the $31,200 that the cheapest Lexus costs.
Toyota said it expects to sell 20,000 to 30,000 Avalons annually.
The car is to go on sale this fall.
