A federal court, ruling that a SciMed Life Systems Inc. coronary catheter infringes on a patent held by a Pfizer Inc. unit, ordered the company to pay damages up to about $66 million.
SciMed was also ordered to close out U.S. sales of its "Rally" model, introduced last spring.
The Rally, sold primarily in the U.S., accounts for about 10% of SciMed's world-wide sales.
SciMed had 1993 sales of $270 million.
The Minneapolis company will be allowed to continue U.S. distribution of the product for 12 months in order to ease the transition for physician customers.
However, it must pay Pfizer's Schneider (USA) Inc. unit a 15% royalty on such sales.
For SciMed, the outcome of the lengthy trial could have been much worse: Damages might have been trebled had the U.S. District Court in St. Paul ruled that the infringement was willful.
SciMed said yesterday that it hasn't yet determined whether it will appeal the verdict.
In New York, Pfizer praised the court's finding, saying it "clears the way for Schneider's continued growth in a competitive marketplace."
Schneider, a relatively small player in the U.S. market, has a more substantial international presence.
In Nasdaq trading yesterday, SciMed shares climbed $1.25 on heavy volume, to $37.50.
Pfizer shares rose 87.5 cents, to $56.875 in late New York Stock Exchange trading.
SciMed and an Eli Lilly & Co. unit are the nation's biggest providers of angioplasty catheters.
Doctors use angioplasty catheters to dilate clogged blood passages.
Because coverage from specific patents can be ambiguous, the business has experienced a raft of litigation.
SciMed has been one of the more aggressive interpreters of patent matters in the past, and it has paid a price.
In late 1991, SciMed agreed to pay Lilly's Advanced Cardiovascular Systems unit a total of $48 million to settle patent litigation filed by ACS.
As part of that settlement, SciMed paid ACS royalties on sales of its Express catheter line, but re-engineered the product and introduced the modified version as the Rally.
It halted sales of the Express late last year.
Schneider's suit contended that the Rally, as well as the now-defunct Express, infringed its patent; SciMed opted to take the Schneider litigation to trial.
SciMed yesterday issued a "very preliminary" estimate that total damages to date, including interest, would total from $60 million to $66 million.
