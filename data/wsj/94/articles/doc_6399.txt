Canadian and provincial governments are expected to cut tobacco taxes soon in an attempt to curb smuggling of cigarettes into Canada.
Details of the plan, which is also expected to include tougher enforcement of anti-smuggling laws, could be announced this week, government officials said.
A cut in tobacco taxes has been strongly urged by the government of Quebec, where tobacco retailers have been protesting their loss of business to smuggling.
Canadian and provincial cigarette taxes are about five times the average U.S. level.
Most smuggled cigarettes are made in Canada, exported duty-free to the U.S., and then rerouted illegally into Canada.
They cost about half the price of legally purchased cigarettes.
The tobacco industry estimates that 30% of all cigarettes smoked in Canada are smuggled.
The contraband market is estimated to be as high as 65% in Quebec.
Canadian health groups have opposed the planned tax cut.
They said lower cigarette prices would encourage smoking, especially among young people.
