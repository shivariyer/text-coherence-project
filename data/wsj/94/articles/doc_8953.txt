Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said it acquired a 19.9% stake in Virgin Interactive Entertainment in exchange for Blockbuster stock valued at roughly $30 million.
The alliance with Virgin, which develops and publishes video-game software compatible with Nintendo and Sega systems, will give Blockbuster another foothold in the rapidly growing world of video games.
Additionally, the move further cements an existing alliance between Blockbuster and Virgin, which together have been developing so-called music megastores overseas and in the U.S.
Analysts and industry executives said closely held Virgin Interactive, which is based in the United Kingdom and controlled by British financier Richard Branson, is preparing to make an initial public offering in the U.S. early this year.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Blockbuster closed at $28.125, down 62.5 cents.
