The Clinton administration is readying a bill that would require telecommunications companies to make sure that law-enforcement officials can continue to monitor conversations on their new systems as communications technology evolves.
The draft bill, which would affect the converging telephone, computer and cable-television industries, is being circulated among the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Commerce Department and the National Security Council.
A similar bill was proposed by the Bush administration but fell victim to opposition from telecommunications companies and civil-liberties groups.
A Clinton administration official said the new bill, described in Saturday's New York Times, would ease several concerns raised by these groups.
For example, the official said, the new bill would exempt several kinds of communications that were included in the earlier bill, including in-house telephone communications and most forms of electronic mail.
Law-enforcement authorities would be required to get court orders to monitor conversations on noncellular, cordless telephones, a protection that doesn't exist today, the official said.
