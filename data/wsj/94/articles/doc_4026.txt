UDC Homes Inc. secured an option to purchase more than 1,000 home sites in Rancho Vistoso, a 5,859 acre planned community in Tucson, Ariz.
Terms weren't disclosed.
In a news release, the Tempe, Ariz.-based builder said the community will contain an office park, commercial buildings, a resort, golf course, parks and more than 2,400 acres of open space.
UDC plans to open three new subdivisions in Rancho Vistoso in 1994, and plans to acquire three additional subdivisions in the Tucson market in 1995, featuring one-story and two-story houses priced from $100,000 to more than $200,000.
