Directors of MTC Electronic Technologies Co. said they will ask the company's chairman and another director, his brother, to resign, pending an inquiry into the chairman's financial dealings.
In a statement issued from the company's Hong Kong office, the audit committee of MTC's board said it called a special meeting to request that a committee inquire into financial dealings between MTC Chairman and President Miko Leung, the company, and "persons connected with the company."
The audit committee said that to ensure the independence of the inquiry, it will request the resignation of Mr. Leung and Sit Wa Leung, MTC's corporate secretary and a director of the company.
Both men named by the committee were in Hong Kong and could not be reached for comment last night.
MTC representatives contacted at the company's Vancouver head-office and at public relations firm Fleischman Hillard, New York, said they couldn't comment on the statement because it had taken them by surprise.
A Vancouver spokeswoman said a directors' meeting was called for today in Hong Kong.
