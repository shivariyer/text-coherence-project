Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc. said a unit signed an agreement to explore for oil and gas in Alaska.
The oil and natural gas company said its Union Texas Petroleum Alaska Corp. and Cook Inlet Region Inc., an Alaska native regional company, agreed to pursue a three-year exploration program on more than 340,000 acres on the Kenai peninsula in south central Alaska about 50 miles southwest of Anchorage.
The unit, which will have a 100% working interest, will conduct the exploration program.
It also will have the option of acquiring oil and gas leases on the acreage, and Cook Inlet Region will have the option of participating in drilling programs.
A spokesman said Union Texas Petroleum would collect and study data on the acreage in 1994 and 1995, and drilling might begin in 1995 or 1996.
