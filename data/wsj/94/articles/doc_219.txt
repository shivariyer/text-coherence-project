Nippondenso Co., a Japanese maker of electronic auto parts, said it will merge three of its wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S. to create a company capitalized at $226 million.
Nippondenso, 24%-owned by Toyota Motor Co., said the new company, Nippondenso America Inc., will have annual sales of roughly $1.3 billion, based on the 1993 sales of the three merging companies.
By setting up the new company, Nippondenso aims to strengthen operations in the U.S., where diversification of new models and increased procurement of local parts by Japanese auto makers are requiring higher-quality services from auto-parts suppliers, the company said.
The three merging companies are: Nippondenso America Inc., which currently oversees the operations of various U.S.based subsidiaries; Nippondenso Sales Inc.; and Nippondenso Technical Center U.S.A. Inc., a research and development concern for auto parts.
The new company, with its 290 workers, will be based in Southfield, Mich.
