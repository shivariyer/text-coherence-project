Kathi Burke, the most senior member of Security Pacific Corp. management team to survive that bank's acquisition by BankAmerica, was named BankAmerica's first female vice chairman, making her the highest-ranking woman in the bank's history.
Ms. Burke, 42 years old, retains her titles as director of corporate human resources and a member of the bank's managing committee.
She had been an executive vice president at Security Pacific, BankAmerica said.
