The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against a shareholder and a broker in connection with trading in Pantheon Industries Inc. stock.
Neither Pantheon Industries nor any of its officers or directors are a party to the suit.
In the complaint, the SEC charged Michael W. Rehtorik, a Miami investor who held shares of Pantheon, and Mitchell S. Rosenthal, a registered securities broker with Main Street Capital Corp., Dallas, with "free-riding" -- or placing orders for securities and not paying for them.
Mr. Rehtorik had previously been enjoined from "association with any broker, dealer" or investment company, the agency said.
Main Street Capital went out of business Jan. 21 as a result of a loss in the account of Mr. Rehtorik, held in the name of Deutsch Trading Co., which had placed orders for Pantheon stock, the SEC said.
Attorneys for Messrs. Rosenthal and Rehtorik didn't return phone calls.
