TakeCare Inc. denied allegations by a shareholder group that it improperly induced management to support a proposed sale of the company to FHP International Corp.
TakeCare said in a filing with the Delaware Chancery Court last week that bonuses offered to R. Judd Jessup, TakeCare president and board member, and others weren't connected with FHP's offer.
The company said a representative of the shareholder group on its board approved the bonuses.
The shareholders, led by investor Henry L. Hillman, collectively own 22% of TakeCare's stock.
Last month the group filed suit in the Delaware court seeking to block an $829 million acquisition offer by FHP of Fountain Valley, Calif.
Both TakeCare and FHP are health-maintenance organizations.
TakeCare's filing also denied the Hillman group's allegation that TakeCare's chairman, Jack R. Anderson, failed to maximize shareholder value in his handling of FHP's bid.
The company said Mr. Anderson boosted the value of the FHP offer by $70 million.
