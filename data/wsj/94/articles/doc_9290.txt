Dollar Time Group Inc. said it ended its agreement to acquire A Real New York Bargain, a privately held retailer based in New York, in a transaction originally valued at $43.6 million.
Dollar Time, a Hollywood, Fla., operator of 55 variety stores, said the two companies disagreed on the direction of Dollar Time's operations.
Moreover, Dollar Time, in a statement, said it had become "concerned" about the profitability of A Real New York Bargain since the two sides agreed to join forces in November.
As part of the original agreement, Joseph Sasson, chief executive officer of A Real New York Bargain, and Jeffrey Klansky, president of the retailer, became chief executive and president, respectively, of Dollar Time, as well as directors.
Yesterday, the two men resigned their positions at Dollar Time.
Dollar Time said Gary de Luca, 40 years old, the company's chief operating officer, was named president.
