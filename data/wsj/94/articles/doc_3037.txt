General Motors Corp. named five new corporate vice presidents, positioning a group of younger executives ranging in age from 39 to 53 to take broader responsibility as more of the company's old guard retires this year.
The appointments appear to quicken the movement by GM President John F. Smith Jr. and the company's independent directors to put younger managers into key positions, largely bypassing executives in their mid- to late 50s.
In November 1992, when GM's directors installed Mr. Smith as chief executive, they also installed three executive vice presidents whose average age was just 44.
The executives GM promoted yesterday are: Heidi Kunz, 39 years old, GM's treasurer; Mark T. Hogan, 42, president of GM do Brasil; Thomas G. Stephens, 45, general manager GM Powertrain engineering; Homi K. Patel, 52, general manager of GM Powertrain manufacturing operations; and Paul J. Tosch, 53, general manager of the Harrison division.
The latest appointments come as GM is awash in rumors that several senior executives who are holdovers from the administration of ousted GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel may retire or leave the company this year.
GM officials haven't confirmed any high-level departures, but they also have done little to discourage the notion that another round of senior management changes is in the offing, now that North American operations have regained profitability and begun generating healthy cash flow again.
Yesterday, GM said George G. Johnston, 62, vice president and general manager of the Delco Chassis division, and Robert D. Wight, age 59, general manager of the Delco Remy division, will retire this summer.
