Lehman Brothers Inc., Capel-Cure Myers Ltd. and Invesco PLC are close to settling, for about #30 million ($45 million), a lawsuit concerning their alleged role in the fall of the late British publisher Robert Maxwell's empire.
The proposed settlement, which two people said may be announced today, would wind up a #200 million claim against the financial companies by trustees of the employee pension fund of Mirror Group PLC, a former Maxwell company.
After Mr. Maxwell's 1992 death, British prosecutors charged that he had plundered about #300 million from his companies' pension funds in an unsuccessful attempt to keep his indebted empire afloat.
The pension-fund lawsuit accused the three companies of participating in improper securities transactions ordered by Mr. Maxwell and of failing to blow the whistle on his illegal activities.
All three have denied the charges.
One person, who declined to be named, said the #30 million payment would be split nearly evenly among the three defendants.
Sunday night, a spokeswoman for Lehman Brothers, a unit of American Express Co., declined to comment, but confirmed that settlement "discussions are going on," in anticipation of today's scheduled start of the trial in London.
Spokesmen for Capel-Cure Myers and Invesco also declined to comment.
