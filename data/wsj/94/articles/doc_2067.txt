Raymond W. LeBoeuf, a prime contender for PPG Industries Inc.'s top post, was named group vice president of the company's key coatings and resins business, in a move that gives him vital experience.
Mr. LeBoeuf, 47, formerly chief financial officer, succeeds Richard M. Rompala.
Once considered a contender for the company's top post, Mr. Rompala left the glass, chemical and coatings producer to choose from what he said were a few offers by other companies.
Mr. Rompala said "it just came time to try to explore" his other options.
Both men were considered candidates for the post of chairman and chief executive officer to succeed Vincent A. Sarni, who retired last summer.
But at the time, the board considered the candidates inexperienced and tapped outsider Jerry E. Dempsey, the chairman of Chemical Waste Management Inc.
The board said then that Mr. Dempsey's appointment was a transition move, giving unnamed internal candidates time to gain experience.
Mr. Dempsey, 61, is expected to retire when he reaches 65.
Analysts said the move strengthens Mr. LeBoeuf's chances for the company's top post.
While respected as a financial executive, he lacked experience running one of PPG's three main businesses -- coatings and resins, glass and chemicals.
He joined the company as treasurer in 1980, was elected controller in 1984, and became vice president of purchasing in 1986.
PPG said it is searching both inside and outside the company for a new chief financial officer.
The other main internal candidates are Robert D. Duncan, 54, group vice president of glass, and Peter R. Heinze, 51, group vice president of chemicals.
