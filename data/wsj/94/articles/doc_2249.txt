Bird Corp. reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $28.8 million, or $7.07 share, on sales of $50.7 million, citing one-time charges and a loss in its environmental-remediation business.
In the year-earlier period, Bird reported a net loss of $541,000, or 23 cents a share, on sales of $47.1 million.
The building-materials and environmental-services company also said it expects to report a loss for this year's first quarter and doesn't expect to resume dividend payments, which were suspended during the fourth quarter, "until it is financially prudent to do so."
For the year, the company reported a loss of $28.3 million, or $7.29 a share, on sales of $212.4 million.
For 1992, the company reported a profit of $3.1 million, or 38 cents a share, on sales of $195.5 million.
The company said the 1993 loss includes a $26.8 million loss from operations relating to its on-site environmental-remediation business, which the company has said it will discontinue in the first half.
The loss for the year includes $16.9 million in nonrecurring charges relating to this decision as well as write-offs of certain other assets and investments.
Of the charges, $14.9 million were in the fourth period.
Bird also said it completed a $65 million refinancing with its banks.
The agreement includes a $40 million revolving credit line for working capital and letters of credit and a $25 million term loan, which the company said it believes will provide sufficient cash to meet its needs this year.
Joseph D. Vecchiolla, Bird's recently appointed president and chief executive officer, said the company "will consider strategic alliances outside of Bird to maximize our shareholders' values."
He said substantial improvement in operating performance should become evident in the second half and beyond.
