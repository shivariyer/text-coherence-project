Aldus Corp. said it signed a letter of intent to acquire Compumation Inc., a small company in State College, Pa., that sells print and image management systems to the graphic-arts industry.
Terms will be disclosed when the transaction is completed, Aldus said.
Compumation, a closely held company, had 1993 revenue of $2.9 million.
