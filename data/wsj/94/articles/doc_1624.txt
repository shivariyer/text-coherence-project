Aber Resources Ltd. and Commonwealth Gold Corp. said that after they complete a proposed merger, they will offer to acquire all the shares of Dentonia Resources Ltd.
The three Vancouver mining companies all hold stakes in a northern Canadian diamond prospect that is the second in Canada to undergo bulk testing to determine the potential for a mine.
Bulk testing is a relatively costly, secondary testing stage that follows small-scale initial tests.
Aber and Commonwealth said the acquisition of Dentonia would consolidate a 26.7% interest that the companies hold in the Tli Kwi Cho diamond discovery in Canada's Northwest Territories.
The discovery is being evaluated by RTZ Corp.'s Kennecott Canada Inc. unit.
The combined companies would also hold interests in 2.23 million acres of diamond claims near the discovery.
Aber and Commonwealth said Dentonia shareholders will be offered two shares of the amalgamated company for each Dentonia common share, and that the offer will be subject to regulatory approvals and to at least 51% of Dentonia's outstanding shares, on a fully diluted basis, being tendered.
They said details of the offer will be mailed to Dentonia's shareholders as soon as possible after completion of the amalgamation, which they expect to take place on or about April 11.
Despite the diamond interests it shares with its would-be acquisitors, Dentonia reacted coolly to the takeover proposal.
The company said that although it hasn't seen a formal proposal, the terms of the proposed offer "appear somewhat inadequate."
Aber and Commonwealth previously said they will seek shareholder approval for a merger at meetings to be held March 31.
They said the new company would use the Aber name and would be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Aber closed at $3.53, up 21.9 cents, or 6.6%.
