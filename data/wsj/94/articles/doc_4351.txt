The flight attendants union of United Airlines said negotiations broke down over the labor group's participation in a proposed employee-buyout of the airline.
Representing United's 18,000 cabin attendants, the Association of Flight Attendants is the only major union that isn't part of the planned $5 billion buyout.
Last month, the United's pilots and machinists unions approved the plan, under which they and noncontract employees are exchanging wage and work-rule concessions for a stake of at least 53% in UAL Corp., the airline's parent company, based in Elk Grove Township, Ill.
The whole transaction still requires shareholder consent.
The measure is expected to be voted this spring.
The deal has already been structured to exclude the flight attendants union, which initially dropped out of the buyout discussions last summer.
It did so to protest United's opening of a cabin attendant base in Taipei, Taiwan, a move the union views as a threat to the jobs of U.S. attendants.
If the flight attendants eventually agree to paycuts and join the buyout, the machinists and pilots will simply shorten the term of their wage concessions.
