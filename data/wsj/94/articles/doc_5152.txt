Swedish pharmaceutical group Astra AB said it won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Rhinocort, an inhalation steroid used in the treatment of hay fever and other disorders.
Rhinocort will be launched in the U.S. in mid-1994 by Astra subsidiary Astra USA Inc., the company said.
