Honeywell Inc. said it reacquired the subsidiary it sold in 1986 when it divested itself of its South African operations in opposition of apartheid.
The Minneapolis controls concern said it purchased the Martech business of Murray & Roberts, a Johannesberg engineering and construction firm, creating Honeywell Southern Africa (Pty) Ltd.
Martech distributes Honeywell systems and products in South Africa and other sub-Saharan countries.
Terms weren't disclosed, but in August Honeywell entered into an option pact to buy back the unit in expectation of an invitation from the African National Congress for U.S. companies to reinvest in South Africa.
Under that pact, which was to expire Nov. 1, 1996, Honeywell had to exercise the option if the ANC called for the lifting of sanctions against South Africa, and if Honeywell was satisfied the purchase wouldn't effect its business relationships with U.S. municipalities that restrict suppliers' involvement in South Africa.
