Hospital Staffing Services Inc. said it is considering measures to increase the value of its shares, including the possible sale of all or part of the home health-care concern.
The move comes amid a proxy battle, launched last month, in which a shareholder group, led by NuMed Home Health Care Inc., is trying to replace the majority of HSS's board -- and ultimately remove some senior managers as well.
A spokesman for HSS said the company's plan is unrelated to the proxy battle and was motivated by the consolidation trend in the medical industry.
HSS, a provider of medical personnel for healthcare facilities, began discussions with investment bankers last fall, he added.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, HSS closed at $3.625 a share, up 25 cents, or 7.4%.
HSS said it expects any possible transaction to be submitted to shareholders for approval at this year's annual meeting.
The date of that meeting hasn't been set, and HSS said there's no assurance that a deal can be struck soon.
Jugal K. Taneja, chairman and chief executive officer of NuMed, said he welcomes HSS's plan for a possible sale or merger.
But he also said he'll continue the proxy fight.
NuMed, a closely held provider of home-health services based in Independence, Ohio, is part of a shareholder group owning 6.3% of HSS, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
The proxy battle is the latest in a string of difficulties at HSS.
In December 1992, the company acknowledged it is being investigated by the FBI as part of a larger probe into possible Medicare fraud.
