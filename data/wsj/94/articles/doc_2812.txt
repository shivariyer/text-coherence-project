Daewoo Corp. of South Korea will lead a $32 million joint venture to manufacture Vietnam's first cars and trucks, the company's senior executive in Vietnam said.
Vidamco, a 30-year joint-venture between Daewoo and Vietnam's GAET company, plans to start production in 1995, said J.S. Kim, Daewoo's general director for Vietnamese operations.
Two other companies now assemble cars from kits imported into Vietnam, but Vidamco will be the first to make vehicles there, Mr. Kim said.
The factory, which was approved for construction last week, will also make automobile parts for export, he said.
Daewoo will hold a 65% share in the project, while the Vietnamese own the remaining 35%.
The plant is to be built in Hanoi, with a first-phase capitalization of $32 million, Mr. Kim said.
