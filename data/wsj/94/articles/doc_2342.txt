DBL Liquidating Trust, which administers the remaining assets of former investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said it would distribute $486.4 million to holders of three classes of certificates of beneficial interest.
The trust said that of the total, $266.9 million will be payable to holders of Class A certificates, $206.4 million to holders of Class B certificates; and $13.1 million to holders of Class C certificates.
The holders of the A and the C certificates are largely made up of Drexel's various unsecured creditors, a trust spokesman said.
The holders of the B certificates are made up largely of individuals and various groups that brought civil litigation against Drexel, he said.
The distribution will be paid March 30, to certificate holders of record March 23.
The interim distribution includes proceeds from the sale of New Street Capital Corp., after payment of taxes and other liabilities, and establishment of required reserves, as well as $6 million in other cash available for distribution.
In December, the DBL trust agreed to sell merchant-banking firm New Street Capital for more than $600 million.
