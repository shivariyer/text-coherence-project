Brazil's government struggled to keep an economic stabilization plan on track after Congress spurned a vote on a key measure.
The legislature, racked by divisions and infighting ahead of general elections in October, failed Wednesday night to schedule and approve a constitutional amendment central to government proposals to combat high inflation.
An infuriated economy minister, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, bitterly attacked the legislature in response, saying the Brazilian people were paying the price for its lack of action.
"We go from impasse to impasse. . . .
How much more can the people take?"
Mr. Cardoso said.
Government leaders in Congress redoubled efforts to line up a quick vote on the constitutional amendment creating a special welfare fund sought by the government.
But final approval, if it comes, might only occur next week or even later.
The government is operating without an approved budget for 1994.
It was the second time in a week that Congress had balked at government proposals aimed at balancing the budget and reining in inflation, currently running at 40% a month.
Last week, the legislature snubbed the government by approving only part of a package of tax increases.
