Morgan Stanley Group Inc. hopes to grab a larger slice of the underwriting business in China, so far ceded to rivals Merrill Lynch & Co., Britain's Barings Securities, France's Credit Lyonnais and local competitors.
The investment bank opened a Shanghai office Friday, its first in China, and has applied to open a second in Beijing, president John Mack said.
He said the firm aims to be among the first full foreign members of the Shanghai Stock Exchange when it opens to outside institutions.
Morgan Stanley will compete to underwrite as many as three of the 22 Chinese companies selected this year for stock-market listings abroad, Mr. Mack said.
Among them, it has focused on the high-profile China Eastern Airlines, which is vying for a primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994.
Morgan officials said the firm is on China Eastern's "short list," also thought to include Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch.
Morgan is also competing with several investment banks for the position of lead underwriter for China's massive Three Gorges Dam hydroelectric project.
The dam, if completed as designed, would be the largest in the world and would require at least $22 billion in financing.
The project has attracted heavy opposition from environmentalists in China and world-wide, who fear it will destroy the scenic Three Gorges along the Yangtze River and threaten several endangered species.
But Morgan, Japan's Nomura Securities, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers, a unit of Salomon Inc., have all expressed interest in representing the government on the dam.
Speaking of the project's cost, Mr. Mack said, "A substantial portion of that will be raised outside China.
I expect Morgan Stanley would have a role in that."
Merrill Lynch opened an office in Shanghai last year.
J.P. Morgan has announced plans to do so this spring.
