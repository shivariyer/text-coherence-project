Inbrand Corp., aided by increases in sales amid stable pricing of its raw materials, will probably exceed analysts' fiscal third-quarter estimates of 25 cents a share and report earnings of closer to 33 cents a share, Garnett Smith, chief executive officer, said.
Last year Inbrand reported fiscal third-quarter earnings of 19 cents a share, pro forma.
The Marietta, Ga., company went public Sept. 2 at $14 a share, and is now trading at about $22 a share.
The company, which provides disposable adult-incontinence products, expects to report that earnings for the fiscal third quarter, ending April 2, increased nearly 80% to approximately $1.8 million from $1 million a year earlier, Mr. Smith said.
Inbrand will report sales for the quarter of about $18.5 million, up more than 20% from last year's $15.2 million, Mr. Smith said.
"Obviously we've had good sales momentum," Mr. Smith said.
"And we've continued to have virtually stable raw material pricing."
