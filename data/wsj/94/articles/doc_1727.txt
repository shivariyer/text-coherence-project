Learning Co. said an unexpected increase in bad debts will cause third-quarter operating results to fall below analysts' expectations.
The educational software maker, based in Freemont, Calif., said it raised its reserve for bad debts by $1.2 million, because of an increase in past-due receivables from unidentified distributors and retailers of its products.
"We see signs of financial weakness out there," said Les Schmidt, the chief financial officer.
As a result, Mr. Schmidt said the company would break even or post a small loss in the quarter ending March 31.
Analysts had expected a profit of between eight cents and 10 cents a share, he said.
In the year-earlier period, Learning Co. reported earnings of $430,000, or six cents a share, on sales of $8.1 million.
