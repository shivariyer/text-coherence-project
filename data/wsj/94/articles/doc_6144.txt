State Farm Mutual Life Insurance Co., which insures more Los Angeles homes than any other carrier, said it expected to pay out at least $600 million in claims related to the earthquake.
The Bloomington, Ill., company, which has already received 80,000 claims from home, car and small-business owners, said the numbers could rise if additional damage is uncovered.
Most of its losses stem from homeowners' insurance.
State Farm, a unit of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., has about 24% of that market in Los Angeles.
Because the company doesn't have reinsurance, which allows insurers to transfer the risk among themselves, the claims payouts will represent a net financial loss.
Yet because the property and casualty arm had a $19 billion surplus at year-end 1992, the disaster isn't expected to hurt the company.
