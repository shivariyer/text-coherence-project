Robert W. Trainer, 44 years old and senior vice president of this insurance company, was named to the added posts of chief financial officer and treasurer, effective Jan. 28.
He succeeded Keith S. Hynes, 41, who left the company on that date.
Mr. Hynes said the company's new president, Gordon Kreh, "is building a new management team and he did not see me on his management team."
He wouldn't comment further.
Mr. Kreh was named president in September.
