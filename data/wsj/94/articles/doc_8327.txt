The Hong Kong government said that its main inflation gauge expanded to 8.6% in December, but that the rate came in at its target rate of 8.5% for the full year.
The 1993 average for the consumer price index "A" measure was "significantly lower" than 9.4% in 1992 and 12% in 1991, the government said.
In December, the rate edged higher on the back of faster rises in food prices, particularly salt-water fish and fresh fruits.
Much of Hong Kong's food is imported from mainland China.
