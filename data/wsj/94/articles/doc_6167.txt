The United Auto Workers union warned General Motors Corp. it could strike a key Flint, Mich., complex of seven parts-making factories as soon as 10 a.m.
Tuesday .
The seven factories in the complex make spark plugs, fuel pumps, instrument clusters and other parts for GM's AC Rochester and Delco Electronic parts divisions.
A strike would idle numerous assembly plants within days.
Thus, the financial effect to the company would be much greater than a work stoppage at a single assembly plant, like the four-day strike that idled GM's Shreveport, La., truck plant last month.
The 6,800 UAW-represented workers in the Flint complex have yet to reach a local agreement with GM.
Neither the company nor the union is saying what issues are unresolved.
Stephen P. Yokich, the UAW's top GM negotiator, said last month the union was pushing GM to reach local agreements at its truck plants and, after that, the union planned to turn up the pressure on GM parts plants, many of which also don't have local labor contracts.
GM settled its latest local agreement at a truck plant this week.
