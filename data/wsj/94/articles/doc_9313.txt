In what could be the initial step toward creating a Canadian junk-bond market, Rogers Cablesystems Ltd. sold what it said was the first issue of high-yield notes denominated in Canadian dollars.
The 300 million Canadian dollars (US$226.8 million) of 20-year, 9.65% notes were snapped up quickly, but mostly by U.S. rather than Canadian buyers.
Rogers Cablesystems, based in Toronto, is Canada's largest cable-television company.
It is wholly owned by Rogers Communications Inc.
Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.
"We hope that this financing will mark the first step in developing a Canadian-dollar high-yield market," said Graham Savage, chief financial officer of Rogers Communications.
But he said it will take time to win over Canadian institutional investors.
Junk bonds are a tough sell with Canadian pension funds and life insurers, most of which have internal guidelines that preclude them from holding debt rated lower than triple-B.
Rogers's new securities were rated double-B-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp. and Ba-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
Underwriters intend to push for more Canadian dollar junk-bond issues.
Robert Gemmell, a managing director of the Canadian subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., said there are at least 20 Canadian issuers that could be tempted by the success of the Rogers issue, which Merrill Lynch managed.
For Canadian companies, issuing high-yield debt in Canadian dollars eliminates the problems and expense that come with swapping U.S. dollar-denominated debt back to Canadian currency, said Mr. Savage.
Rogers has been a big borrower in U.S.-denominated issues in the past.
