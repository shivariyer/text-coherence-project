American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it reached agreement with other telecommunications providers to participate in construction of the first undersea fiberoptic cable system linking Vietnam, Thailand and Hong Kong.
The 3,400-kilometer (2,108-mile) system will link stations in Sri Racha, Thailand; Vung Tau, Vietnam; and Hong Kong's Deepwater Bay.
The pact was signed by representatives of the Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications of Vietnam, the Communications Authority of Thailand, a unit of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., a unit of Australia's Telstra Corp., AT&T and 14 other telecommunications companies.
AT&T said it will own a 2% stake in the system.
The project's cost wasn't disclosed.
