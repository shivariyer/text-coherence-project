Lasmo PLC said its loss narrowed in 1993 to #131 million ($195 million) from #392 million in 1992.
Sales for the U.K. energy group gained 9.2% to #678 million from 621 million.
Profit before exceptional items totaled #110 million, down slightly from #112 million in 1992.
Lasmo called 1993 a "year of solid achievement" in terms of operating performance in both exploration and development, restructuring, controlling and reducing costs, and strengthening the financial position by raising new capital and disposing of assets.
But it said results for 1993 were adversely affected by higher net interest charges, the decline in dollar oil prices, and the need to make provisions against certain assets.
