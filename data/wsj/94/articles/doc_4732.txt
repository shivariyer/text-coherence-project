Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman of Cie. des Machines Bull, would like to open the French state-owned computer maker's capital to employees and new industrial partners later this year.
Mr. Descarpentries said he'd like to allocate 15% to 20% of the group's shares for employees, while two or three outside partners could purchase stakes of 10% or 15% each.
NEC Corp., the Japanese company that already owns about 5% of Bull, was cited as a possible candidate.
"Each of our divisions could cooperate with an outside industrial partner," Mr. Descarpentries said.
He said a successful cooperative effort could lead to "mergers and introductions on the Bourse," with the cash generated used for reinvestment.
The French government currently owns 72% of Bull, while state-owned France Telecom has 16%, and International Business Machines Corp. holds less than 2%.
Mr. Descarpentries said he'd like the state to retain a small stake in Bull, and he also wants France Telecom to stay in.
The goal of his plan is to convince authorities of the European Union that Bull merits the 9.5 billion franc ($1.6 billion) recapitalization proposed by French Industry Minister Gerard Longuet.
The EU has been blocking the flow of state capital injections pending details on how Bull intends to restructure, which have been slow in coming.
Mr. Descarpentries said he's convinced he can put Bull back on its feet in two years, and he added that NEC supports his plan, focusing on dividing the group into separate profit centers.
Bull expects further losses this year, though not as wide as in 1993.
Bull announced a preliminary loss before restructuring charges of 3.42 billion francs.
Mr. Descarpentries also pledged to stick to the plans of his predecessor, Bernard Pache, to cut 6,500 jobs worldwide in the two years to the end of 1994.
The new chairman will decide after June whether additional layoffs are necessary.
