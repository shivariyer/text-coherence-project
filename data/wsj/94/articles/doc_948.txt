A drop in aircraft sales led to a 2.5% drop in orders for big-ticket factory items in February, the Commerce Department said, but other durable-goods manufacturers looked solid.
The decline, to $145.01 billion from a revised $148.78 billion in January, was the first since July.
But excluding volatile transportation and defense spending, factory orders for durable goods -- those intended to last three years or longer -- actually rose 5.3% in February.
The sector represents about three-quarters of all capital spending.
The jump in nondefense, nontransportation orders was especially welcome, as it followed a dip of 6.9% in January for that sector.
"That number gave me a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach," said Paul McCulley, chief economist for UBS Securities.
"I wanted to see that number back up.
This was a major source of strength for 1993."
Those orders are up 20.2% from a year ago.
January's overall orders for durable goods were revised upward, to a 4.4% rise from a previously estimated 3.7% increase.
Unfilled orders, a barometer of future factory output, fell 0.3% in February, the 11th decline in 12 months.
That could mean that factories are having little trouble meeting demand with their current work force.
But excluding defense and aircraft, unfilled orders rose for the past nine months.
Orders for industrial machinery and equipment posted the sharpest gain at 4.7%.
Orders for primary metals showed a slight gain of 0.4%.
Orders for electronic equipment were off, falling 5.6%.
Economists didn't expect much market reaction to the generally upbeat report.
The Federal Reserve acted Tuesday to raise the short-term rates that banks charge each other, in an effort to head off inflation sparked by strong economic growth.
Interest-sensitive sectors such as home construction and the manufacturing of household appliances and capital equipment have propelled the current recovery.
