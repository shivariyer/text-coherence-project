For the year-earlier fourth quarter, the REIT had a net loss of $3.5 million, or 67 cents a share.
Rymac said its earnings were "severely impacted by the unprecedented high level and extended duration of prepayments on residential mortgages."
The prepayments were due to the availabilty of lower interest rates.
