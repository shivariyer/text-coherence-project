The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped back after Friday's chilling sell-off.
The index of 30 blue-chip stocks rallied 34.90 points to 3906.32, recovering more than a third of the losses it suffered after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates Friday.
Other stock market barometers staged partial recoveries, helped in part by a stabilizing bond market.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index climbed 1.95 points to 471.76, and the Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 1.92 to 779.20, recouping just a fraction of the loss incurred Friday.
But the number of advancing stocks continued to trail declining issues, 1,044 to 1,178, causing some nervousness among technical analysts.
Trading was heavy with volume on the Big Board easing to 346,779,000 common shares from Friday's hectic 377,773,000 shares.
Though some stock strategists were predicting further declines yesterday, stock prices stabilized once it became apparent that individual investors weren't stampeding out of mutual funds.
"The big question coming into yesterday was whether the individual investor would buy on weakness," said William Dodge, chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter Reynolds.
"But judging by the volume and the price action that shouldn't have been a worry."
Indeed, Fidelity Investments, the U.S.'s largest mutual fund company, reported that about $90 million flowed into the firm's domestic stock funds yesterday.
Though, for a brief moment, it didn't look like yesterday was shaping up to be a pleasant day.
"For the first two hours of the day, it was a little scary," said Neal Litvack, executive vice president at Boston-based Fidelity.
"We saw more money go out of the funds than into the funds."
But Mr. Litvack said the situation started to turn around at about 10:30 a.m. EST.
All of a sudden, investors who had put in early orders to redeem shares from Fidelity began calling up to cancel their requests.
Others began phoning in orders to buy more shares.
Despite yesterday's strength, Mr. Dodge of Dean Witter isn't ready to give the stock market a clean bill of health.
He thinks stock prices could fall an additional 2% to 3% in the coming weeks as bond prices erode under the weight of the Treasury's refunding and a set of inflation numbers that many economists say will likely be unfavorable.
Economically sensitive stocks were behind the industrial average's comeback.
Aluminum Co. of America jumped 2 to 78 1/8, General Motors 1 3/8 to 63, Caterpillar 2 3/4 to 105 1/4, and General Electric 1 3/4 to 108 1/4.
Mr. Dodge said it was only logical that cyclical stocks performed well yesterday because the Fed's move to ratchet up interest rates came largely in response to the strengthening economy.
Meanwhile, rate-sensitive stocks continued to lag behind.
Banking stocks ended mixed after early signs of weakness.
The Dow Jones Utility Average eased 0.86 point to 219.35 and a number of insurance stocks took it on the chin.
Equitable lost 1/4 to 26 1/2, Aetna Life & Casualty 1/4 to 60 7/8, and St. Paul 2 3/8 to 83 1/4.
International Business Machines added 2 1/4 to 54 1/4, after tumbling 3 1/2 in Friday's market sell-off.
Barron's magazine said Big Blue was named one of the favorites of investment managers responding to its quarterly "Big Money Poll."
Among others, Home Depot climbed 1 5/8 to 39, and Intel added 1/4 to 62 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Meanwhile, many other technology issues were strong.
Motorola advanced 1 to 96 1/4, Compaq Computer rallied 2 5/8 to 87 7/8, and Texas Instruments gained 1 3/4 to 72.
On Nasdaq, Apple Computer added 3 1/8 to 36 1/2 and 3Com rose 1 3/4 to 58 1/8.
Asarco jumped 1 1/2 to 25, Phelps Dodge gained 1 3/8 to 56 1/4, and Magma Copper increased 5/8 to 15 7/8 after Merrill Lynch raised ratings on shares of the copper producers.
Asarco's intermediate-term rating was lifted to "above average" from "neutral."
The other two were raised to "buy" from "above average."
However, precious metals producers were weak as gold for April delivery tumbled in New York.
American Barrick was off 1 to 25 3/4, Homestake Mining dropped 1 1/8 to 21, Newmount Mining dropped 2 5/8 to 52 and, on the Amex, Echo Bay Mines declined 3/8 to 12 3/4.
SciMed Life Systems skidded 1 3/4 to 40 on Nasdaq.
Hambrecht & Quist analyst Kurt Kruger attributed the weakness to concern about a possible delay in the Maple Grove, Minn., medical device maker's patent dispute with Pfizer.
Mr. Kruger said a federal court decision on the matter may not come as soon as expected.
The company said it wasn't aware of any reason for the weakness.
Callaway Golf rallied 4 1/4 to 68 3/4, a move that a spokewoman for the Carlsbad, Calif., company was at a loss to explain.
One positive for the company, though, was that Johnny Miller, a company spokesman, won a tournament Sunday using Callaway clubs.
