Quantum Corp., Milpitas, Calif., said fiscal third-quarter net income fell 78% as pricing competition continues to ravage the computer disk-drive industry.
Quantum earned $6.1 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with $28 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier.
In the period ended Jan. 2, sales were $523 million, up 14% from $459.3 million.
The company pointed out that new products and other factors helped boost its gross margins, rising to 11% from 2% in the second quarter.
Its biggest customer is Apple Computer Co., which represents 17% of the company's sales and has slashed prices to boost demand for its personal computers.
