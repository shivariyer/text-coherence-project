Secom Co., Japan's leading maker of electronic security systems, is considering expanding its operations in Asia, a senior company executive said.
Secom already operates joint ventures in Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.
Koji Kato, head of Secom's management control office, said the company is "now studying inroads into other remaining Asian countries as well."
Mr. Kato said the Asian region has high growth potential.
"The situation in Asian countries is very much like the one in the early 1960s in Japan," he said.
He declined to specify which Asian countries are being considered for more Secom investment but said the company's deliberations will be concluded soon.
In May, Secom will establish its first joint venture in China, in the city of Dalian.
Mr. Kato said the company is also considering more ventures in "several other locations" in China.
Meanwhile, Secom's earnings for the fiscal year ending March 31 are likely to meet forecasts, as a result of smooth growth in contracts for Secom's mechanical security services, Mr. Kato said.
Secom forecasts pretax profit for the current fiscal year of 33.3 billion yen ($316 million), up from 29.15 billion yen a year earlier, on sales of 178.9 billion yen, up from 165.86 billion yen a year earlier.
