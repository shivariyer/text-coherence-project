Prof. Jeffrey Sachs begins his Dec. 30 editorial-page piece "In Defense of Russia's Reformers" with a curious, inaccurate and gratuitous remark.
It is directed toward those who advocate currency boards as a means to stabilize and make convertible the ruble.
He asserts that right-of-center pundits have attacked reformers for rejecting currency boards.
Currency boards are hardly the exclusive domain of the right.
Indeed, currency boards enjoy the support of those from all parts of the ideological spectrum, including ideologically neutral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.
If that weren't enough, the only currency board to ever operate in Russia (1918-1920) was fathered by none other than John Maynard Keynes -- hardly a right-winger.
As for the reformers' rejection of currency boards, what makes Prof. Sachs's remark even more curious is the fact that, in some of his other writings, he has waxed lyrical about employing currency boards in the former Soviet Union (FSU).
For example, an article he co-authored with Ardo Hansson ("Crowning the Estonian Kroon," Transition, October 1992) concluded that:
"The Estonian monetary reform clearly points the way for the new states of the FSU.
Most, or all, will have their own national currencies.
Estonia's experience demonstrates that it is possible to move to a stable and convertible currency right from the start, if the policies are supported by a sound institutional bulwark (such as a currency board arrangement) and by sound fiscal policy."
Prof. Sachs's defense of Russia's omniscient reformers would be a good deal more credible if he would get the facts straight and stop changing his own tune.
