Syndicator King World Productions Inc. reached an agreement with Oprah Winfrey to continue distributing her top-rated talk show through the 1999-2000 television season, making her a major shareholder in return.
Ms. Winfrey's contract expires after the 1994-1995 season, and there was speculation she would end the eight-year-old show.
The new contract includes an option that lets Ms. Winfrey leave after the 1995-1996 season.
The program, which is produced by Ms. Winfrey's Harpo Inc., generated about $185 million in revenue last year for King World, or about 39% of the company's total revenues.
Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Jessica Reif called the new deal "extremely positive."
King World will continue to distribute the show for a percentage of profits for the first two years of the new deal.
In the final three years, the company will instead get a distribution fee based on a percentage of gross revenues derived from the series, which will be less lucrative than the current arrangement, but still leave the show King World's most profitable.
Under the contract, Ms. Winfrey, who already controls one million of King World's 38 million shares outstanding, will receive options to buy an additional 1.5 million King World shares.
