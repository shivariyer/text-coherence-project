National Westminster Bancorp Inc. said fourth-quarter net income nearly doubled to $96.1 million from $50 million a year earlier.
The Jersey City, N.J.-based U.S. unit of National Westminster Bank PLC of the United Kingdom said the strong improvements reflect smaller provision for loan losses and gains in interest income.
Net interest income for the fourth quarter was $207.5 million, compared with $197.2 million a year earlier.
Provisions for loan losses were $19 million, down from $30.5 million a year ago.
For the year ended Dec. 31, net was $298.1 million, up 92% from the previous period's $155.2 million.
Nonaccrual loans fell to 3.2% of total loans as of Dec. 31, down from 7.1% a year earlier.
Total assets were $23.66 billion, up from $22.73 billion.
