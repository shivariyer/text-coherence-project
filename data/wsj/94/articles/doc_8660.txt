Michigan National Corp. reported net income for the fourth quarter of $32.6 million, or $2.13 a share, and announced a cost-cutting drive that includes shutting bank branches and eliminating jobs.
The bank holding concern's profit included a $7.8 million gain from the sale of mortgage servicing rights.
A year earlier, it earned $11.9 million, or 78 cents a share.
"We've got a cost base here we can't afford, and we've got to change it," said Douglas E. Ebert, Michigan National's president and chief operating officer.
The concern, based in Farmington Hills, Mich., plans to reduce its operating expenses by $20 million this year.
It will eliminate 80 jobs and close about 12 bank branches in Michigan.
It will also decide whether to shed operations in California and Texas, said Robert J. Mylod, chairman and chief executive officer.
For the full year, net fell to $23.8 million, or $1.56 a share, from $59.8 million, or $3.96 a share, a year earlier.
