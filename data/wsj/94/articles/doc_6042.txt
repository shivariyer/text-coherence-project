E.W. SCRIPPS Co. (Cincinnati) -- Ken Lowe, 43 years old, a vice president of this company's broadcasting unit, Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co., was named to the additional post of president of the company's new Home and Garden Television Network unit.
An E.W. Scripps spokesman said later this year the new unit expects to launch a 24-hour cable channel originating from Knoxville, Tenn., that will feature programs on home repair, remodeling, gardening, home electronics and decorating.
E.W. Scripps is a media communications concern.
