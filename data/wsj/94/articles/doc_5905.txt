The annual rate of inflation in Brazil's major cities rose 2.1 percentage points to 41.3% between Dec. 30 and Jan. 28, according to a government report released yesterday.
The rate was up from the 39.2% in the 11 largest cities from Dec. 14 to Jan. 14, the government's National Institute of Geography and Statistics said.
By contrast, the rate was 28% a year earlier, according to economic data released at the time.
Brazil has no single inflation index.
The government uses several official and private indexes to calculate the cost of living.
