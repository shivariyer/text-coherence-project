Exar Corp. expects sales for its current quarter to be about 10% below sales in its fiscal third quarter, in which the company said it earned $4 million on sales of $38.4 million.
The maker of integrated circuits said in San Jose, Calif., that its orders have been strong, but that certain of its products are in short supply.
The company, which said it was still too early to make "any specific prediction" for its March results, also blamed "continued weakness" in Japanese demand.
In its fourth quarter ended March 31, 1993, Exar earned $3.7 million on sales of $37.5 million.
Separately, Exar repurchased 1.5 million of its own shares from Rohm USA Inc. for $23.6 million.
The sale reduces Rohm's holdings in Exar to slightly less than 5% from 20.9%.
Exar also said its board had authorized the open-market repurchase of as many as 300,000 shares of its common stock during 1994.
