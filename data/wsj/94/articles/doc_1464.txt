Like many Americans, Tim W. Ferguson confuses standard of living with quality of life.
The "progress" he describes in his column "Days of Whine and Poses" (Business World, March 1) seems to reflect an increased standard of living and not a better quality of life.
One of the best indicators of quality living is the amount of time we are able to spend with our families and friends, especially the time we spend nurturing our children in their formative years.
Although the "business class" couple he describes might have a better standard of living than their parents, one wonders if their quality of living is improved.
Does a higher standard of living result in a richer life?
Alas, true progress will not be made in many aspects of our lives until the distinction between standard of living and quality of living is fully recognized.
