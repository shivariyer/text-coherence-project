A Chicago investment-advisory firm agreed to pay a $25,000 penalty to settle allegations that the firm violated antifraud statutes in the handling of $8 million in customer assets.
The firm, Gofen & Glossberg Inc., neither admitted nor denied the violations alleged by the Securities and Exchange Commission in an administrative action.
The firm, founded in 1932, has about $2 billion under management.
"This case is significant because more and more people may be using investment advisers," said Joy Boddie, special counsel for the SEC in Chicago.
The SEC charges relate to the customer assets that Gofen & Glossberg held under its control as trustee between 1983 and 1991.
The agency alleged that the firm failed to disclose the custody of the customer assets in its filings with the SEC; failed to file an audited balance sheet for the customer assets; and failed to hire an independent accountant to conduct a surprise annual examination of the accounts.
The firm agreed to be censured by the SEC and said it will hire a consultant to monitor its compliance with SEC rules for five years.
The firm's lawyer, Paul Uhlenhop of Chicago, declined to comment on the SEC action, and a spokesman for the firm couldn't be reached immediately for comment.
