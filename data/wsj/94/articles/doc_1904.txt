Sherwin-Williams Co. was assessed $1 million in penalties as part of a settlement of lawsuits alleging that the company violated California's tough antitoxics law.
The big paint maker also agreed to explore whether it can either remove toluene, a toxic hydrocarbon, from its spray paints and adhesives, or devise nontoxic alternative products.
Under certain circumstances, costs of that effort could be used to offset part of the $1 million fine.
In the meantime, Sherwin-Williams agreed to put labels on spray paints and adhesives sold in California, warning that those products contain potentially dangerous chemicals.
The settlement is part of a broad agreement ending various suits against Sherwin-Williams and about 37 other spray paint and adhesive manufacturers and retailers.
The suits were brought by As You Sow, an environmental group, and the state attorney general's office.
The suits alleged that the companies violated California's Prop. 65, a law that limits certain toxins in products sold in California and requires that products containing certain toxins carry warning labels.
The $1 million penalty is the largest ever assessed under the law.
Other companies involved in the settlement agreed to pay a total of $200,000.
The settlement could have national impact.
If Sherwin-Williams can reformulate the products for the huge California market, it likely would reformulate them for sale in other markets, environmentalists said.
Sherwin-Williams, based in Solon, Ohio, said it agreed to the settlement without admitting any guilt.
It characterized the dispute as stemming from "different interpretations" of various regulations.
