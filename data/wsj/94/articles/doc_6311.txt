The former chairman fired from Germany's Metallgesellschaft AG is seeking a settlement of nearly 10 million marks ($5.68 million), the magazine Der Spiegel reported.
But a spokesman for the engineering, metals and trading company said such a request hasn't been received.
The company's stock fell 13 marks, or 5.6%, to 221 marks in Frankfurt.
Heinz Schimmelbusch, who was chairman of the management board, was fired in December, a month after his employment contract was renewed for five years.
The company cited a lack of control over company operations and failure to keep the supervisory board properly informed.
According to Der Spiegel, some of Mr. Schimmelbusch's allies within the company want the settlement paid out as soon as possible.
Other officials want to await the outcome of a special audit that in part will examine whether the former official disobeyed German corporate law.
If that is the case, he wouldn't receive a settlement.
