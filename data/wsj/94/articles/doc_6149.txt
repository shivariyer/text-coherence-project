Douglas & Lomason Co. said it took a one-time charge of $9.6 million, or $2.28 a share, against fourth-quarter earnings related to the closings of four manufacturing facilities.
As a result, the Farmington Hills, Mich., auto-parts supplier posted a fourth-quarter loss of $7.9 million, or $1.86 a share.
That compares with a profit of $3 million, or 72 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales for the quarter climbed 1.9% to $112.6 million from a year-earlier $110.5 million.
Douglas & Lomason said its factories in Troy, Mo.; Cleveland, Miss.; Phenix City, Ala.; and Havre de Grace, Md., will be closed this year, lowering costs by $5 million annually beginning next year.
For the full year, Douglas & Lomason reported a loss of $7.2 million, or $1.70 a share, after the charge.
That compares with year-earlier profit of $8.8 million, or $2.25 a share.
