Three outside directors of Gitano Group Inc. resigned from the troubled apparel maker, and the New York Stock Exchange said it has suspended trading in the company's shares and would seek to delist them.
The actions follow Gitano's announcement Monday that it was putting itself up for sale.
The directors who resigned are Michael Goldstein, vice chairman of Toys "R" Us Inc., Kevin Kennedy, a partner at Goldman Sachs & Co., and Norman Matthews, a consultant.
"With the process to sell Gitano under way, these directors believe that their contribution to Gitano is complete and they can now focus on their other business interests," Robert E. Gregory Jr., Gitano's chairman, said.
The Big Board said it will apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist Gitano because Gitano said it was "unlikely" that a sale of the company would realize an amount in excess of the $130 million that Gitano owes its secured lenders.
The exchange also said Gitano no longer meets certain listing criteria.
