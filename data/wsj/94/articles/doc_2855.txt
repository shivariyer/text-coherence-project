The Justice Department is requesting information about the market clout of General Instrument Corp., a leading supplier of high-tech equipment to the cable industry.
A person close to General Instrument confirmed that the company has been contacted by the Justice Department as part of a broad inquiry into cable-equipment manufacturers and called it "nothing substantive."
The company declined to comment.
Justice Department officials couldn't be reached for comment.
The inquiry was first reported by Satellite Business News, a trade publication.
General Instrument is the leading maker of television set-top cable decoder boxes.
Several companies are competing to supply the cable industry with the next generation of set-top boxes.
Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 1 cable operator, late last year said it would buy set-top boxes from General Instrument, Hewlett-Packard Co. and ScientificAtlanta Inc. for use in TCI's conversion to digital systems over the next two years.
General Instrument remains TCI's biggest supplier of the devices.
