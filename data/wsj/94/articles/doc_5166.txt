Eric Schmidt, previously head of this computing concern's Sun Technology Enterprises, was named to the newly created position of chief technology officer for the entire company.
Mr. Schmidt, 38 years old, will be succeeded by Ed Zander, 47, who retains his post as head of SunSoft, the company's software unit.
In a related move, Chet Silvestri, 45, previously vice president of sales and marketing for Sun's Sparc chip business, was named head of that business.
He succeeds Bob Graham, 43, who resigned last December to form his own business.
