The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was a stalwart opponent of big government in the 1980s, but since Bill Clinton's election it has become, well, more flexible.
Chamber officials crow that this approach gives them "access" to Clinton advisers, but the result has mostly been a greater willingness on their part to side with the White House.
Yesterday, as the Business Roundtable voted 60 to 20 to reject the Clinton health plan, we received a copy of the health care testimony the Chamber had submitted to House Ways and Means for delivery today.
For those who remember the old Chamber, it was an eye-opener.
Robert Patricelli, who heads a managed-care health company and chairs the Chamber's health care committee, noted that the Chamber was "in full agreement" with the Clinton goal of universal coverage.
The Chamber's testimony went on to "accept the proposition that employers should provide and help pay for insurance on a phased-in basis."
That sounded like an endorsement of an employer mandate for health care, so we called the Chamber to clarify its position.
Just before press time, the Chamber faxed us a new statement from Mr. Patricelli.
In it he said the testimony we'd seen "was inadvertently sent to the committee by Chamber staff and does not accurately reflect the position of the Chamber on health care reform. . . .
We cannot support any of the mandate proposals."
Mr. Petrocelli then says the Clinton plan would impose "such a burden" of regulation and bureaucracy that "we believe it cannot even be used as a starting point for committee markup."
Sounds as if, after some confusion, the Roundtable and the Chamber have the same position.
