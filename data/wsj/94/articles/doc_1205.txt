The Federal Trade Commission said it will seek a federal court order blocking the planned acquisition by Healthtrust Inc. of three Holy Cross Health System Corp. hospitals in Utah.
"The FTC will allege that the acquisition would significantly decrease competition for inpatient, acute-care hospital services" in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, an agency statement said.
Both Healthtrust, Nashville, Tenn., and Holy Cross, a nonprofit organization sponsored by the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in Notre Dame, Ind., operate hospitals in the Salt Lake City area.
Healthtrust, which operates 81 hospitals in 21 states in the South and West, was "disappointed" with the agency's decision, said Kent Wallace, regional vice president.
"We have maintained all along that the sale would benefit over 85% of the state's residents by providing them with the option of a cost-effective, integrated health-care delivery network."
Mr. Wallace said Healthtrust still has a "number of options" it might pursue.
"We will weigh each option," he said, "and determine where we go from here."
