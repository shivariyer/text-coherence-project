Houston private investigator Edmund J. Pankau -- who has claimed a role in numerous high-profile investigations -- has been kicked out of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, a professional organization, for allegedly violating its code of ethics.
Mr. Pankau, the subject of a Jan. 12 Texas Journal article, couldn't be reached for comment.
But his attorney, Ken Norman, says the organization's decision was unfair, because Mr. Pankau "did not have an opportunity to sit down and confront his accusers."
In a printed statement, the Austin-based professional organization accuses the 48-year-old Mr. Pankau of breaching its code of professional ethics by making "numerous conflicting public statements about his alleged role, if any, in several different investigations."
The group didn't specify which investigations.
Mr. Pankau has gained a larger-than-life reputation based on reports of his exploits.
He claims, for example, that his firm videotaped U.S. Sen. Gary Hart with model Donna Rice, and says his investigators tipped off the Miami Herald to the relationship -- which the newspaper denies.
Moreover, according to published accounts, Mr. Pankau has helped nab a notorious gang of jewel thieves and rushed into a burning building to snatch a computer printout of the financial holdings of deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
Meanwhile, the Texas Board of Private Investigators, which licensed Mr. Pankau's firm, Intertect Inc., in 1974, is "checking into the veracity of documents submitted to the board for his original license," says spokesman Ken Nicolas, adding that "action that could be taken against him range from reprimand to revocation" of the license.
