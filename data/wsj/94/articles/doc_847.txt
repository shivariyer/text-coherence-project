The 10 domestic auto makers said they plan to build 263,721 cars and trucks this week, up 21% from the 218,622 vehicles built in the same week last year.
General Motors Corp. said strikes at two Ohio brake plants caused parts shortages at several GM assembly plants.
Several plants were forced to close as a result.
However, all of affected assembly plants have resumed normal operations.
Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and GM said they planned overtime this week at U.S. assembly plants.
The Big Three auto makers have steadily run assembly plants on overtime this year to keep up with demand for vehicles.
Toyota said it scheduled overtime tomorrow to compensate for production lost earlier this year due to severe weather.
