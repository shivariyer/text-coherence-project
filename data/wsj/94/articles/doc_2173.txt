Taco Bell Corp. said smoking will be banned in all 3,300 company-owned restaurants, effective March 28.
The fast-food chain, a unit of PepsiCo Inc. in Purchase, N.Y., said it expects its 1,000 franchise stores to follow.
Taco Bell joins a growing number of restaurant companies to adopt a nosmoking policy.
In February, McDonald's Corp. said it would ban smoking, in its 1,400 company-owned restaurants in the U.S.
The chain, based in Oak Brook, Ill., added that it planned to encourage franchisees, who operate a majority of the 9,100 domestic McDonald's, to follow suit.
Overall, one-third of the members of the National Council of Chain Restaurants, whose members operate nearly 90,000 establishments, have already banned smoking.
Taco Bell said its decision was based, in part, on a year-long customer survey.
In that study, according to the company, 70% of smokers and 84% of nonsmokers said they found smoking in fast-food restaurants to be offensive.
