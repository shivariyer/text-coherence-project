MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. said it will explore the possible sale of its Harmac market-pulp business.
MacMillan Bloedel will reorganize the Harmac mill in Nanaimo, British Columbia, and its related marketing network as a separate unit.
The mill employs 760 people and has annual capacity of 350,000 metric tons.
MacMillan Bloedel, a forest-products concern, said it has decided to focus on its building materials, groundwood printing-paper and packaging businesses.
