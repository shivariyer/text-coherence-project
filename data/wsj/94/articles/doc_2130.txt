Eight Utah hospitals and two health organizations agreed to settle a federal lawsuit charging them with conspiring to keep nurses' wages down.
The Justice Department said the hospitals, the Utah Society for Healthcare Human Resources Administration, and the Utah Hospital Association agreed in a proposed consent agreement not to fix nurses' wages or share wage information except in limited circumstances.
The society is a professional association of hospital human resource directors; the hospital association is a trade group.
The hospitals, all in Salt Lake City, are: St. Benedict's Hospital, IHC Hospital Inc., Holy Cross Hospital, Pioneer Valley Hospital Inc., Lakeview Hospital Inc., Mountain View Hospital Inc., Brigham City Community Hospital Inc. and HCA Health Services of Utah Inc., which does business as St. Mark's Hospital.
