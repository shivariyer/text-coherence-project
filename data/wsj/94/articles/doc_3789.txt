Northwest Airlines' chief executive officer, responding to union pressure, said he will return a special $750,000 bonus paid by the company for restructuring its finances.
John H. Dasburg agreed to give back the one-time bonus just as members of the Machinists union at Northwest were planning a rally yesterday to protest the payment.
The rally was canceled on news of Mr. Dasburg's decision.
Union officials applauded Mr. Dasburg's gesture as "significant," but called on him and other members of Northwest's management to give up their annual bonuses as well.
Northwest, which gave management $2.3 million in incentive-based bonuses last year, defended this policy.
"We need to keep good people here," said a company spokesman.
"With the goals we have, you need to pay sensible compensation."
According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Dasburg's 1993 salary of $463,906 was topped by an incentive-based bonus of $450,705 and the special bonus of $750,000.
The chief executive said he is returning the special bonus to preserve trust between the airline's management and workers.
"It's more important to this airline to accomplish its goals than it is for me to have another $750,000," said Mr. Dasburg.
"Leadership has a price, and sometimes it includes my pocketbook."
Last summer, Northwest's employees agreed to $886 million in wage cuts to help prevent a threatened bankruptcy filing by the nation's fourth-largest airline.
In exchange, top officers took salary reductions of nearly 20%, and employees, including managers, received a 34.2% stake in the company.
Mr. Dasburg's giveback "was the right thing to do," says a spokesman for the Machinists union.
"Those junior executives should do the same thing, but I'm not holding my breath."
