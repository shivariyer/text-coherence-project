Allegheny Power System Inc., New York, said compliance with the Clean Air Act of 1990 will cost it $669 million, down from a 1991 estimate of $806 million.
The utility holding company said estimated cost for scrubbers on three of its power-plant units has fallen to $555 million from $726 million in 1991.
Allegheny said regulators in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia allowed the company to include certain construction costs in its rates during construction.
Other savings came from favorable construction contracts and planning, the company said.
Allegheny's principal operating units are Monongahela Power Co., Potomac Edison Co. and West Penn Power Co.
