Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., the U.S. pharmaceutical subsidiary of French chemicals and drug group Rhone-Poulenc SA, said its 1993 net income fell 4.6% to $408.7 million, as sales declined 2% to $4.02 billion.
The unit also said per-share earnings will likely be "moderate" in 1994, that is around 10% above 1993's per-share earnings of $2.96.
And per-share earnings growth in 1995 and beyond should be at least 10% per year, depending on the success of new products, company officials said at a news conference in Paris.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer officials also said that they are looking for a "strategic partner" to develop operations world-wide in over-the-counter drugs.
Chief Operating Officer Michel de Rosen said that the group wants to increase its weight in the OTC business in the U.S. and improve its results in Europe.
