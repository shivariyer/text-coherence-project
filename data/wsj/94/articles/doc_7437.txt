FMC Corp. and Harsco Corp. completed the formation of a joint venture which combines their defense operations.
The venture, known as United Defense L.P., expects to record 1994 sales of about $1 billion.
FMC, which received a 60% stake in exchange for its Defense Systems Group, will manage the operation.
Harsco, based in Harrisburg, Pa., contributed its BMY Combat Systems Division for a 40% holding.
United Defense, with about 6,000 employees, is based in Arlington, Va.
The companies initially agreed to the combination, the latest in a series of consolidation moves in the defense indus try, in December 1992.
Combining FMC's technical and sys tems capabilities with the Harsco unit's low-cost and flexible manufacturing ability, FMC said, "will allow both companies to maintain profitable operations in the shrinking defense market."
United Defense will manufacture such equipment as the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzer, an armored combat earthmover, and other armored vehicles; other products include naval guns and launching systems.
FMC also has interests in chemicals, precious metals and machinery.
Harsco retained its much-larger division that makes trucks for the U.S. Army, along with other diversified manufacturing operations.
