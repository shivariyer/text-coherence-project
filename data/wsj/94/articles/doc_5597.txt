Tommy Moe of the U.S., in the narrowest victory ever in Olympic Alpine skiing, won the downhill race by four-hundredths of a second over World Cup leader Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway.

"I just figured, hey, I'll ski the best I can."
Mr. Moe, who turns 24 in four days, raced down the course in 1 minute, 45.75 seconds.
Mr. Aamodt finished in 1:45.79.
Canada's Ed Podivinsky, with a time of 1:45.87, took the bronze.

"Today was the big day.
I knew I could get in the top six, and anything better would be wonderful.
I'm really excited now," said Mr. Moe, who hadn't won a downhill in major international meet since the 1989 World Junior Championships.

I got the intermediate times during the race and I knew I was going fast."
