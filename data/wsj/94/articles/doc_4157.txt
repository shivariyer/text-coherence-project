UNISYS Corp., Blue Bell, Pa., said directors approved full payment of dividend arrearage on its Series A cumulative convertible preferred stock, or a total of $80 million.
Unisys declared a dividend on the stock of $3.75 a share, including the arrearage of $2.8125 a share and the quarterly dividend of 93.75 cents a share, payable April 15 to stock of record March 23.
Unisys had suspended preferred stock dividends in February 1991 and resumed partial payment of the dividend arrearage in October 1992.
Unisys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James A. Unruh said the information systems company's strong financial performance and significant operational progress permit it to accelerate the plan to make up the arrearage.
