SportsTown Inc., battered by competition, said it expects to report a loss of about $3 million for its fiscal fourth quarter.
The sports retailer said it hired Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. to develop "alternatives to maximize shareholder value."
One option, an executive said yesterday, may be to sell the company.
SportsTown has posted a series of quarterly losses and has seen its share price fall 80% in the past 18 months.
In trading yesterday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the stock closed at $3.625, down 12.5 cents.
Late Friday, SportsTown said it expects to report a loss of about $5 million for its year ended Jan. 30.
Sales for the year, the company said, jumped about 35% to about $165 million.
Same-store sales, however, fell 2.1% during the year.
In the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, 1993, net income was $1.6 million, or 33 cents a share, on sales of $41.6 million.
For the full year, earnings totaled $2.4 million, or 52 cents a share, on sales of $121.9 million.
"We'd been missing our sales plans, but we didn't think it was going to be long-term like this," said Clyde S. Fossum, chief financial officer.
As a result, he said the company was choked last quarter by excess inventory that it had to mark down and clear with expensive promotions.
The company reported a loss of $1.7 million, or 35 cents a share, for the quarter ended last Oct. 31, and $500,000, or 10 cents a share, for the quarter ended last July 31.
As of last November, the company projected a profit in the fourth quarter.
