Fokker NV said it will cut around 1,900 jobs in 1994 as part of a restructuring plan announced this month.
The Amsterdam aerospace company also said it will reduce production to about 40 aircraft a year from its current annual production of around 60.
Even with the deep job cuts, some stock analysts say they don't expect Fokker to swing back into the black before 1997.
And after that, they see little prospect for strong profit gains.
The company said that the remaining work force after the cut of 1,900 jobs will total slightly more than 10,000 people.
Fokker is 51%-controlled by the Deutsche Aerospace AG arm of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG.
