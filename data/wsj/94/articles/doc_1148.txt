Ipsco Inc. said it once again settled on Muscatine County, Iowa, as the site for its proposed $360 million steel minimill.
The steelmaker, based in Regina, had previously chosen Iowa to build the minimill.
But the company reversed the decision last month, saying it would consider two other states where legislation wasn't required to purchase the land where the minimill would be built.
The states weren't identified.
Ipsco said a final decision to build the minimill in Iowa still depends on the state government designating the site a "quality jobs enterprise zone" and other conditions.
