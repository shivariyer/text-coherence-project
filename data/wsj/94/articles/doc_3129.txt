W.R. Grace & Co. said it agreed definitively to acquire Home Nutritional Services Inc., a Marietta, Ga., provider of home infusion therapy services, for $7.85 a share, or $90.3 million.
A spokesman for Grace said the acquisition will cost the company about $110 million, including fees.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday, Home Nutritional shares closed at $7.75, up $1.
Home Nutritional, which had 1993 sales of $132 million, will become part of Grace's NMC Homecare unit, the third-largest national provider of home infusion services.
Grace, a specialty chemical maker, said it will begin a tender offer by Thursday for all of Home Nutritional's 11.5 million shares outstanding.
The offer is subject to a number of conditions, including the tender of a majority of the Home Nutritional's outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis.
Shares not tendered will be acquired for the same $7.85 price.
In connection with the pact, Healthdyne Inc., which owns a 68% stake in Home Nutritional, has agreed to tender its shares to Grace.
As a result of the transaction, Healthdyne won't proceed with its plans for a partial exchange offer for 2,150,000 shares of Home Nutritional stock.
Home Nutritional's board has approved the offer and recommended that stockholders tender their shares.
