Philip Morris Cos. increased its quarterly dividend by 6.2% to 69 cents a share from 65 cents.
The company also said it planned to resume its share-repurchase plan, which had been suspended since the first quarter of last year.
The higher dividend is payable April 11 to stock of record March 15.
Philip Morris shares rose 62.5 cents to close at $58.875 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange in a down market on the news that the company would once again start buying its shares.
Philip Morris stopped buying back its shares last year because of the costly domestic tobacco industry price war.
As a result, the company has $1.2 billion remaining in its original stock-repurchase authority.
The company extended through the end of 1994 its existing authority to repurchase stock, which had been set to expire in May.
Wall Street analysts said Philip Morris is likely to announce a new share-repurchase program later in the year.
Since 1992, the company has purchased 52 million shares for a total of $2.9 billion.
With the stabilization of prices in the domestic tobacco industry, Philip Morris's dividend increase was expected.
The dividend increase gives Philip Morris stock a yield of 4.7%.
Last year, because of the tobacco turmoil, Philip Morris failed to raise its dividend for the first time since 1967.
