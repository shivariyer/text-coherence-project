The Federal Communications Commission is extending the freeze on cable-TV revenue to May 15 while it conducts a review of prices charged for service.
A revenue freeze imposed last year, during implementation of new rules, was due to expire Tuesday .
But an outcry last fall over changes in how cable companies bill customers -- which resulted in allegations that many people received higher bills -- led the agency to reconsider its rate rules.
The agency is expected to review its rules this month, and officials said extending the freeze would make it easier to implement any new regulations.
Meanwhile, communities are in the process of certifying local cable companies as monopolies, a process that permits them to regulate basic cable service.
FCC officials said the freeze also extends the time for communities to act.
