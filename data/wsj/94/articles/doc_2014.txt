Vicorp Restaurants Inc. said net income for its first quarter ended Feb. 20 dropped 33% to $3.6 million, or 36 cents a share, from $5.4 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier.
Despite opening 11 new restaurants, the Denver-based company said revenue rose to $130.7 million from $130.4 million a year ago.
The company said sales were hurt by severe weather in the Midwest and the effects of the earthquake and winter rains in California.
Industry analysts said that while weather was a problem, the company's Bakers Square division has been pounded by more aggressive competitors in the family-dining segment.
Charles R. Frederickson, chairman, said that operating margins fell almost three percentage points, or about $3.6 million, in comparison with last year's first-quarter results.
