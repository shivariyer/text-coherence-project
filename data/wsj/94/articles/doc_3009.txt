Second Harvest, a Chicago-based network of 185 food banks that provide food through some 42,000 charitable agencies, said nearly 26 million Americans, or 10.4% of the population, used the network at some point last year.
The report, funded by Kraft General Foods Inc., a unit of Philip Morris Cos., and compiled by VanAmburg Group Inc. consultants in Erie, Pa., said more than 45% of recipients hadn't expected to need assistance three months before seeking aid.
Second Harvest added that many clients are recently unemployed, live in single-parent families, or are homeless.
The study was conducted in two parts.
A mail survey was sent to the 9,300 agencies who work with 34 Second Harvest food banks.
More than 3,180 agencies responded.
The study also conducted 8,596 interviews with clients.
Second Harvest said the two studies were cross-referenced in an effort to eliminate double counting.
The sampling was then projected across the group's network.
Skeptics point out that some recipients may simply be trying to stretch their budgets and aren't chronically needy.
And Second Harvest said it didn't intend to try to measure all hunger in the U.S. but to evaluate its own network.
Nonetheless, the figures are likely to become factors in the continuing political debates on health and welfare issues.
