This savings bank declared a semiannual dividend of four cents a share, payable March 8 to holders of record Feb. 28.
Although the dividend is equivalent to the four-cent-a-share dividend paid in September, it represents a 50% increase after giving effect to a 50% stock dividend paid on Dec. 17.
Washington Savings said earnings for its fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 31 nearly doubled, to $1.2 million, or 26 cents a share, from $628,000, or 14 cents a share.
The increase was mainly attributable to a pretax gain of about $1.6 million from the sale of about $24 million of mortgage-backed securities that previously had been accounted for differently.
The company said that while it believes repositioning its balance sheet will be positive for the long term, earnings for the next one or more quarters "may not compare favorably" with year-earlier periods until the funds can be more favorably redeployed.
