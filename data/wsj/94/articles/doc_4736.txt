National Media Corp. spurned a second unsolicited tender offer from ValueVision International Inc. as financially inadequate, and recommended that its stockholders not tender their shares.
ValueVision, the third-largest U.S. home-shopping network, had made a tender offer of $10.50 a share in cash for 5.83 million shares of National Media, a producer of infomercials.
These shares combined with the 1.2 million shares ValueVision said it already owns would represent 50% of National Media.
ValueVision would then offer $10.50 in ValueVision stock for each of the remaining National Media shares.
National Media rejected a $10 a share offer in December.
National Media said the second offer, valued at roughly $134 million, was "frontend loaded" and "highly coercive."
National Media also said that ValueVision couldn't afford to pay for the shares it seeks to buy and "has presented no evidence that the offer is either financed or financeable."
A spokesman for ValueVision countered that "financing won't be an issue."
National Media plans to continue exploring options relating to a potential merger, acquisition or alliance with all parties, including ValueVision.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, National Media closed at $10.875, up 12.5 cents.
ValueVision closed at $9.25, up 12.5 cents, in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
