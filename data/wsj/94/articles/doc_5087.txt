Imutec Corp. said it has received clearance from Canadian regulators to begin a Phase III clinical trial of Virulizin in treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.
The Toronto pharmaceutical concern said the placebo-controlled double-blind trial will study whether the treatment can prolong the survival time of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
The trial will be conducted in cancer clinics across Canada and will involve about 300 patients.
Imutec said tests of the treatment to date show a median survival time of eight months, longer than the normal survival time of 3 1/2 months, and patients appear to have a better quality of life.
The Phase III trial is the final phase before the treatment can be approved by regulators and prescribed as a cancer therapy.
