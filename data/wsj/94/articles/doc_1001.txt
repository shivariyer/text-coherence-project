Glaxo Holdings PLC said it has signed an agreement that will allow Wellcome PLC an option to develop and market the experimental compound 3TC for the treatment of the AIDS virus.
The compound, generically called lamivudine, is currently under clinical development with Glaxo for the treatment of hepatitis B.
The compound was licensed to Glaxo in 1990 by BioChem Pharma Inc. of Laval, Quebec.
Wellcome has made an initial payment to Glaxo, and a further sum is due if Wellcome decides, following further tests, to develop and market 3TC.
