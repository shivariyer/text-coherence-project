Regarding your Jan. 24 editorial "North Korea's Nuclear Cloud," particularly the statement that "A Pyongyang Times editorial last week noted with a sense of urgency: `It's our nation's supreme task to reunify the country in the '90s and hand down a reunified country to generations to come.'"
To wit, on the 1949 Independence Day, the same newspaper reported a speech by Kim Il-sung in which he stated that the 1950 Independence Day would be celebrated in Seoul.
Interesting, is it not?
