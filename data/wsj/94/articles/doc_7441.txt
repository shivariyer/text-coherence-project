Trans Financial Bancorp, Bowling Green, Ky., said it entered a definitive agreement to acquire FGC Holding Co. in a stock transaction valued at $17 million.
FGC holders will receive 419.83 Trans Financial shares for each FGC share held.
The $17 million transaction value is based upon Thursday's closing price of $16.25 and the issuance of about 1,050,000 new Trans Financial shares.
Trans Financial said it expects the transaction to constitute a tax-free reorganization and to qualify for the pooling-of-interest method of accounting.
Trans Financial is a $1 billion bank company and operates 37 branches in Kentucky and Tennessee.
FGC, based in Martin, Ky., is a $126 million bank holding company for First Guaranty National Bank.
Trans Financial said it expects to merge First Guaranty into its commercial bank subsidiary, Trans Financial Bank upon closing of the transaction.
