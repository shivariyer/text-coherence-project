Consolidated Stores Corp. said it signed a purchase agreement with Milwaukee-based Value Merchants Inc. to acquire the assets of Value's Wisconsin Toy Wholesale Division and Toy Liquidator Retail Stores in a cash transaction valued at $20 million to $25 million.
Consolidated said no debt or financing would be issued for the acquisition and that it would be paid through internal funds and existing credit facilities.
Value Merchants and its subsidiary Everything's A Dollar Inc. are reorganizing under the protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, and the impending acquisition is subject to court approval, Consolidated said.
Consolidated, a close-out merchandise retailer and wholesaler based in Columbus, Ohio, said the purchase would add between 80 and 86 stores to its 618 stores.
