South Carolina Electric & Gas Co., the principal subsidiary of Scana Corp., said it reached a settlement with Westinghouse Electric Corp. resolving a dispute involving steam generators provided by Westinghouse to SCE&G's V.C. Summer Nuclear Station.
Terms of the settlement weren't disclosed.
SCE&G had filed an action in May 1990 against Westinghouse in federal court in South Carolina seeking compensation for damages to the Summer station.
