Honshu Paper Co. and Takasaki Paper Mfg. Co. agreed to form a broad range of business ties in production and distribution, company spokesmen said.
Honshu and Takasaki will each invest about 1 billion yen ($9 million) in the other's shares.
Honshu will become the fourth-largest shareholder of Takasaki, a Takasaki spokesman said.
Honshu is Japan's third-largest paper and pulp maker and holds the largest share of the domestic market for paperboard.
Takasaki is a paperboard maker with the 11th-largest share in Japan.
Mergers in Japan's paper industry seem to have become the order of the day, as companies struggle against weak prices.
After the merger of Jujo Paper Co. and Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp Co. to form Nippon Paper Industries Co. last April, two other companies -- Kanzaki Paper and Oji Paper Co. -- merged on Oct. 1.
