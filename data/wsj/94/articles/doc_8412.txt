Telefonos de Mexico SA will expand its line network by 12%, or about 900,000 lines, in 1994 to 8.3 million lines, according to the company's program published by the Mexican Communications and Transportation Ministry.
The expansion is set by the terms of the Mexican telecommunications company's December 1990 privatization.
Telmex previously reported that it would spend 7.5 billion new pesos ($2.42 billion) on capital improvements in 1994.
Telmex will add 31,000 public telephones this year to reach a density of two public phones for each 1,000 residents.
The company also will add more than 2,100 miles of fiber-optic lines.
That will complete work on Telmex's 8,400-mile fiberoptic trunk network connecting the nation's 54 principal cities.
Telmex also plans to incorporate an additional 3,000 rural communities with more than 500 inhabitants each into its network this year, reaching a total of 19,000 such communities.
