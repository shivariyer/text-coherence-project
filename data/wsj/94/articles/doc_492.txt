Indresco Inc. said it will buy back its common stock from holders of fewer than 100 shares.
A spokesman for the Dallas company, a supplier of equipment for the mining and construction industries, said from 1% to 2% of the company's 24.4 million shares outstanding are involved, and it would cost the company about $5 million to buy back all of those shares.
Participation in the buyback is optional for holders.
Indresco said it will pay a price per share equal to the average of the highest trading prices for Indresco common stock reported for the days from April 1, 1994, through May 3, 1994, less a processing fee of 50 cents a share.
Indresco said Shareholder Communications Corp. will manage the program, which applies to holders of record March 28, 1994, and expires May 3, 1994, unless extended by Indresco.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Indresco shares closed at $15, up 37.5 cents.
