Housing starts rose 6.2% last month, the Commerce Department said, pushing homebuilding for 1993 to its highest level in four years.
December starts punctuated a brisk fourth-quarter, surging to an annual rate of 1,540,000 from a revised 1,450,000 in November, the department said.
For all of 1993, housing starts totaled 1,285,100 units, up 7.1% from 1,199,700 in 1992 and the highest since 1989, when work was begun on 1,376,100 units.
Economists attributed the strong growth to a generally better economy, low mortgage rates and stable housing prices, factors that make homes not only more affordable but also a better investment.
Consumers are willing to "put their money in an asset that is not depreciating," explained Joseph Liro, chief economist for S.G. Warburg.
Dr. Liro believes that last year's growth wasn't a one-shot deal and that housing starts will run at an annual rate of nearly 1.5 million by the end of 1994.
Still, analysts warn that this month's figures might not be so good, with the cold wave impairing construction in much of the country.
However, this effect "will reverse when the weather gets better," said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.
The Los Angeles earthquake might hold down starts in January, though rebuilding might boost them later on.
Mr. Steinberg suggested that the earthquake's effect would be too localized to have a significant impact on national housing-start figures.
Building permits for future construction rose 7.3% in December, the Commerce Department said, a further indication that the upswing in homebuilding isn't temporary.
Homebuilding often is a measure of how well the overall economy is doing, and the latest figures bode well for the current recovery.
"When starts go up and permits go up, we know this is not a momentary recovery," declared Bob Davis, chief economist of Savings & Community Bankers of America.
In December, starts of single-family homes climbed a solid 3.5% to an annual rate of 1,330,000.
Starts of apartment buildings of five or more units, which vary widely from month to month, zoomed 34% in December to an annual rate of 177,000 units.
Smaller multifamily units held steady at a rate of 33,000.
December figures were up in every region except the Northeast, where homebuilding contracted by 3.5% from November.
The West, where starts have been climbing after being depressed by the long California economic slump, posted the sharpest increase, 14.7% from November.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits rose 23,000 last week to 380,000 from a revised 357,000 the week before.
The four-week average of weekly claims -- considered a better signal of labor-market conditions -- rose 12,500 to 346,750.
Figures in both reports have been adjusted for seasonal variations.
Separately, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank said he doesn't expect economic growth this quarter to match the torrid pace of the 1993 fourth-quarter.
In remarks prepared for delivery in Reno, Nev., Robert Parry noted that while most estimates put economic growth at a 5% annual rate in the fourth-quarter, "it's unlikely that this rate of growth will continue."
He estimated that about two percentage points of the fourth-quarter surge can be attributed to an increase in auto production that was designed to replenish depleted inventories, a factor that isn't likely to recur.
Mr. Parry, who is among the five regional Fed bank presidents with a vote on monetary policy this year, anticipates 2 1/2% growth, "small reductions" in the unemployment rate and a "further moderate reduction in inflation in 1994."
With "a good deal of the slack in the economy" eliminated, continued "rapid growth" could lead to higher inflation in the future, Mr. Parry said.
"A period of moderate growth would be an excellent outcome."
