Marianne M. Jennings's Jan. 3 editorial-page article "A Mother Talks to Mrs. Clinton," resonated strongly with me.
I had a mercifully more brief and less intense exposure to government bureaucracy while caring for my late husband, a college professor who died of a brain tumor in 1985 when he was 51.
It has made me a fervent advocate for less government (intrusion) always.
And a Republican.
A seriously ill person increasingly loses control over his life, his surroundings, himself.
To consistently deprive him of even more control is to torture the patient and the family.
To this day I feel outrage at the upstate county visiting nurses who wanted to "manage" us and at the Albany hospice that wanted to do the same thing.
In the end, we thankfully left the hospice, fired the bureaucracy-entrenched nurses, wrote and advertised a job description of exactly the nursing care we needed, and survived at home until his death.
Much of what I hear and read of the Clinton administration's health care proposals may be summed up in a struggle over who controls what.
My own scarifying learning experience puts me on the side of personal freedom.
I can only hope that many agree.
