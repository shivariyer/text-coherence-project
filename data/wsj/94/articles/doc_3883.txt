Canonie Environmental Services Corp., Dallas, said it agreed to merge with BCM Engineers Inc., a closely held environmental consulting concern with 1993 revenue exceeding $60 million.
Canonie didn't disclose terms of the transaction, except to say they include the payment of cash and preferred stock.
BCM is based in Plymouth Meeting, Pa.
Canonie, which provides engineering services to help clean up hazardous-waste sites, also said it expects to post a loss of about $2.4 million, or 42 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended yesterday.
A year earlier, the company had a loss of $9.1 million, or $1.59 a share, after $10.6 million in pretax special charges.
