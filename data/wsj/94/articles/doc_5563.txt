The CDC apparently is not above "cooking the numbers" to further its antiself-defense agenda ("Firearms Gain on Car Crashes as Top Killer," Jan. 28).
Comparing all gunshot deaths from homicide, suicide and accidents to deaths only from automobile accidents is scientifically dishonest.
As cited in the article, only 4% of gun deaths were "unintentional."
An objective study would have compared only these accidental gun deaths (1,533) with similarly unintended auto accidents (43,536), producing a dramatically different result than that achieved by biased data.
Further, it is deceptive to emphasize the seven jurisdictions (14%) where gun deaths exceed car deaths -- including, I might note, New York and the District of Columbia, the two with the strictest gun control measures in the nation -- instead of the 44 states (86%) where the reverse is true, including states with few or no gun-control laws.
