Reuters Holdings PLC agreed to restructure the Globex after-hours futures-trading system in an effort to boost its disappointing trading volume.
Reuters and two of its partners in Globex, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Paris-based Marche a Terme International de France, announced the agreement at a news conference from which the Chicago Board of Trade, the other partner in Globex, was conspicuously absent.
The new agreement will give foreign-futures exchanges, such as the Paris exchange, which is known as Matif, a greater role in governing the system.
(Matif accounts for about 85% of the Globex futures-trading volume.)
Reuters executives and John F. Sandner, chairman of both Globex and the Chicago Merc, hope the agreement will entice such exchanges as the London International Financial Futures Exchange to list their futures contracts on the system.
Reuters and the CBOT have clashed repeatedly over Board of Trade activities that some Reuters executives feel compete with Globex.
Still Mr. Sandner and Rosalyn Wilton, Reuters's managing director for transaction products, say they will be negotiating with CBOT executives to include it in the restructured system.
