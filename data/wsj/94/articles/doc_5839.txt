Fleming Cos., taking a heavy hit for restructuring and consolidation costs, posted a slightly worse than projected loss for its fourth quarter ended Dec. 25.
The Oklahoma City food distribution concern reported a net loss for the quarter of $49.3 million, or $1.34 a share, compared with net income of $25 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier.
The more recent quarter included a $101.3 million pretax charge for consolidation and restructuring, and a $2.3 million charge for early retirement of debt.
Sales for the quarter rose 1.6% to $3.15 billion from $3.10 billion a year ago.
For the year, Fleming reported a 69% drop in net income to $35.2 million, or 96 cents a share, from $113 million, or $3.16 a share in 1992.
Sales for the year grew 1.5% to $13.09 billion from $12.89 billion the previous year.
Robert E. Stauth, president and chief executive, blamed the small sales gains on intense competition and lack of food-price inflation.
He said the company plans to continue consolidating into larger distribution centers "and to eliminate functions and operations that do not add value."
