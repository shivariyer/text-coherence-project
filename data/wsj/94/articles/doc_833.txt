A state-court jury in Newark, N.J., added $3.5 million in punitive damages to its award to a former Mobil Oil executive who had filed a wrongful-discharge suit, bringing the total award to nearly $7 million.
Plaintiff Myron A. Mehlman alleged he was fired after disclosing health problems associated with Mobil products.
The Mobil Corp. unit says Mr. Mehlman was dismissed for legitimate reasons.
"We are confident the verdicts will be vacated, either by the trial judge or on appeal," J. E. Fowler, general counsel of the parent company, said in a statement issued from company headquarters in Fairfax, Va.
A hearing on whether the verdict should be vacated is scheduled for April 15.
A lawyer for the plaintiff has said he expects his client to win the case on appeal, if necessary.
