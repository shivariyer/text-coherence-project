Lion Group signed a long-awaited privatization agreement with the government of the Malaysian state of Sabah to acquire its financially ailing Sabah Forest Industries Sdn. Bhd. in a cash transaction valued at 500 million Malaysian dollars (US$181.8 million).
The signing of the deal closed one chapter in the divestment of one of the state's largest assets and one of the biggest drains on the state's coffers.
Market attention will focus on measures to be adopted by the Kuala Lumpur-based Lion Group to revive the deeply indebted SFI, whose operations include logging and pulp-and-paper manufacturing.
Malaysian investment analysts are wary of Lion's ability to turn around SFI because the Sabah company's operations don't mesh with Lion's, which involve steel manufacturing, motorcycle assembly, property development and retailing.
