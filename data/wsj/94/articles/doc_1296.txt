Stock and bond prices sank amid concerns about an impending interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
The dollar fell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 30.80 points to 3864.85.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.52 to 468.54, and the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 6.63 to 797.30.
The industrial average fell 30 points in the first 90 minutes, giving back virtually all of Friday's gains.
Investors' chief focus was today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve.
John Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest Inc. in Hartford, Conn., said investors were worried that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan may boost rates by more than expected just to assert the Fed's independence following Mr. Greenspan's summons to the White House Friday.
"Because questions were raised about whether he is in the president's pocket, he may have to be more draconian to maintain his credibility as an inflation fighter," said Mr. Shaughnessy.
He said if the federal-funds rate is lifted more than a half point, stocks and bonds could suffer.
But a smaller increase may spark rallies as the uncertainty about the rate move would be lifted.
The federal-funds rate is the interest rate on overnight loans between banks to meet Fed requirements.
Bond traders were jittery about a possible rate boost partly because it would imply that the economy is strong and inflation a possibility, analysts said.
Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist at NationsBank, said the Fed needs to raise rates soon in recognition of the economy's strength.
"Delaying it gives only the wrong signal and puts off the inevitable," he said.
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index lost 0.65 to 115.20.
Stock prices fell.
Volume totaled 247.4 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,580 issues fell and 627 rose.
Bond prices slumped.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue lost nearly 5/8 point, or almost $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.95%.
The dollar weakened.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.6885 marks and 106.00 yen compared with 1.6965 marks and 106.10 yen Friday.
