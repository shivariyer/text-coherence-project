Continental Micronesia, the Pacific division of Continental Airlines, said it requested U.S. Department of Transportation approval to begin daily service between the U.S. and Vietnam.
The service would operate from Guam, where Continental Micronesia has its hub, and continue to Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City four days a week and Hanoi three days a week.
Continental said it could feed traffic from 65 cities through Houston; Los Angeles; Newark, N.J.; Honolulu; and San Francisco to Guam and then to Vietnam.
