Ziff Communications Co. and Washington Post Co.'s Digital Ink unit agreed to put the national newspaper on Ziff's new on-line service.
The offering, scheduled to begin in the fall with the start of Ziff's Interchange on-line service, will offer news from the Washington Post and include local sports, calendars of cultural events, and other neighborhood news for Washington residents.
The service also will provide readers with electronic discussion groups, including interactive "chat" with editors and reporters, and will allow users to access the Internet, the global computer network.
Donald K. Brazeal, editor and publisher of Digital Ink Co., said the new Post subsidiary is pursuing other national and international on-line offerings aimed at business users.
News stories in the print version of the Post will include referrals to the new on-line service for additional information.
Pricing for the service will be similar to the $9.20 monthly subscription rate for the newspaper, based on a maximum number of hours to be determined.
For an extra fee, subscribers will be able to access Ziff's Interchange service.
Ziff is giving the Post and other publishers control of the "look and feel" of their on-line newspapers.
