A Colombian coffee exporter was charged with defrauding several banks of some $97 million by submitting allegedly false documents seeking payment for the export of large amounts of nonexistent coffee.
Ruben Dario Echeverri, 43 years old, whose family controlled a Colombian company called Gonchecol Ltda. was arrested in Miami and charged with one count of bank fraud.
Federal prosecutors allege Mr. Echeverri, between December 1985 and August 1986, submitted fictitious bills of lading indicating the coffee had been loaded onto trucks to collect on a series of letters of credit, according to a complaint filed in a federal court in New York.
Mr. Echeverri hasn't retained an attorney yet.
Among the financial institutions allegedly defrauded are Chemical Banking Corp.'s Chemical Bank ($35 million), Banque Paribas ($25 million), National Westminster Bank PLC's National Westminster Bank USA ($18 million) and American Express Co.'s American Express Bank Ltd. ($13 million).
If convicted Mr. Echeverri faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine of as much as double the amount of the fraud, according to prosecutors.
