Stock prices were mixed as fears of trade war between the U.S. and Japan rattled financial markets.
The U.S. dollar plunged almost five yen against the Japanese currency, while the Treasury's 30-year bond lost more than 1/2 point, lifting its yield to 6.45%, all in reaction to Friday's collapse of U.S.-Japan trade talks.
Stocks fared better but still posted a lackluster performance.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 9.28, or 0.24%, to 3,904.06, while broad-based barometers of action on the New York Stock Exchange barely moved.
Nearly half of the Dow's gain came from one stock, United Technologies, which rallied 2 to 67 3/8.
Advancing Big Board issues narrowly led decliners, 1,134 to 1,029.
Volume on the exchange was moderately active at about 263.1 million shares.
Just 211.8 million traded Friday, but that session closed early because of severe winter weather conditions in the Northeast.
Yesterday's was the first full session since Jan. 24 that volume didn't top the active 300 million mark.
Stocks started the day higher, pushing the Dow industrials to a gain of more than 25 points around midday.
But the optimism evaporated as the dollar's decline intensified, and bonds turned decidedly lower.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index inched up 0.05, or 0.01%, to 470.23, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped 0.05, or 0.2%, to 261.26.
The Nasdaq Composite Index, however, jumped 4.06, or 0.52%, to 785.45.
Technology stocks played a large role, with Lotus Development up 2 1/2 to 58 1/4, Microsoft up 3/8 to 79 1/8 and Oracle Systems up 1 to 32 3/4.
Insurance stocks also were strong.

Paramount Communications lost 3/4 to 76 1/8.
QVC Network ruled out changing its $10 billion offer for the giant New York media company, increasing the odds that Paramount shareholders will choose a rival offer from Viacom.
The deadline for both offers was 12:01 a.m. today.
QVC shares jumped 1 5/8 to 48 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while Viacom Class B skidded 1 3/4 to 29 on the Amex.

The sale will generate 484 million Canadian dollars (US$360.3 million) in proceeds for the company.
It expects to complete the sale next month.
Precious-metals stocks jumped along with the price of gold.

SciMed Life Systems skidded 2 5/8 to 39 5/8.
The medical-device maker in Maple Grove, Minn., said its results for the fourth quarter that ends Feb. 28 have been depressed by lower-than-expected sales in Japan.
It blamed the shortfall on high-inventory levels at hospitals in Japan and predicted improved sales there later in its 1995 fiscal year.

In addition, the company said it will repurchase up to 12 million presplit shares.
James Solloway, director of research at Argus Research, said the dollar's big sell-off is troubling for two major reasons.
First, weakness in the currency could increase inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy.
Second, it could cause Japanese investors to liquidate positions in U.S. stocks and bonds.
Rising rates and a weakening dollar were two of the ingredients that set off the 1987 stock-market crash.
Analysts don't think the market situation now is that precarious, but the severe weakness in the dollar is "certainly serious if it continues," said Argus's Mr. Solloway.
"A very weak dollar is in nobody's interest."
Meanwhile, Paul Rabbitt, quantitative analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said he doesn't expect interest rates to rise to a level that would entice people to buy interest-bearing investments instead of stocks.
