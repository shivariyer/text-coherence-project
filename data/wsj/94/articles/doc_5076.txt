In your Feb. 2 Money & Investing article "Kitchen-Sink Bonds Prompt SEC Review," you accurately addressed the hidden risks in kitchen-sink, or cashflow, bonds, but failed to mention that Standard & Poor's refuses to rate these issues precisely because of the concerns described.
As the article noted, regulators are concerned because investors may misunderstand what investment-grade ratings represent as they relate to these securities.
But it left the impression that all rating agencies provided triple-A or top ratings to these risky investment.
That is not the case.
Although S&P has been regularly approached to rate cashflow bonds, we have declined to do so.
While the instruments have, to date, been limited to large institutional investors, it is important to S&P that its ratings be understood by the broad range of investors so they are not left with a false sense of security.
