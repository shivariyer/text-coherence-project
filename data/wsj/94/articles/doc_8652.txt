Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing for a possible downgrade its ratings on $3.7 billion of debt issued by Con Edison.
Moody's said the review reflects concerns about the company's ability to make its interest payments on debt, in view of competitive pressures and uncertainty about future rate increases.
Moody's also said it is concerned about Con Edison's future obligations to pay independent power producers under long-term contracts that don't appear on its balance sheet.
A Con Edison spokesman said the company plans to demonstrate that it has "considerable financial strength, a very sound balance sheet and very good financial flexibility."
Among the ratings under review are the double-A-one rating of Con Edison's first- and refunding mortgage bonds.
MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE Inc. placed the credit ratings of Consolidated Edison Co. of New York under review for possible downgrades in part over concerns about "the company's ability to improve debt-protection measures."
In Friday's Credit Ratings column, it was incorrectly stated that Moody's was concerned about the company's ability to make its interest payments on debt.
