Some analysts continue to think small stocks can surpass old closing highs this week.
Christine Callies, a market analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, said that within the next three weeks, she sees the Nasdaq Composite rising to 810 to 815, above its record of 800.47.
The Russell could move up to 270 to 272, breaking through its previous high of 267.62.
Ms. Callies bases her bullish stance on a belief that most of the bond market's losses are factored into equity prices at this point.
Moreover, the analyst said, "bonds are capable of a technical bounce due to an oversold condition."
She added that the money flow into other sectors apart from technology, the pied piper of small-cap stocks, is showing that "the market is supported by more than just one group."
