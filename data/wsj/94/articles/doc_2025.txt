Stocks were mixed despite a rally in bonds.
Even though the first of this week's key inflation readings reassured the bond market, stock investors remained hesitant to make major commitments.
Profit-taking in some big economically sensitive stocks helped send the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 13.39 to 3849.59.
The average was down more than 20 points at its session low.
Broad-based indexes that track mostly New York Stock Exchange issues were somewhat stronger, however.
Advancing issues, meanwhile, outpaced decliners on the Big Board by 1,138 to 1,000.
Volume on the exchange was active at 303.3 million shares, compared with a moderate 260.1 million shares Monday.
The Treasury's 30-year bond jumped more than 7/8 of a point, aided by a Labor Department report showing a smaller-than-expected rise in core inflation.
Excluding food and energy prices, the producer price index was up 0.1%, compared with an expected 0.2% rise.
A reading on consumer-level inflation is due from the Labor Department today.
Although a jump in bond prices, and the resulting drop in market interest rates, often will trigger buying in stocks, that didn't happen yesterday.
Partially depressing stocks, traders said, was heavy selling in stock-index futures contracts.
Several observers said that selling, in tandem with buying in bond futures, seemed to indicate that some investors were reshaping their portfolios to hold more bonds and fewer stocks.
The Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 0.38 to 467.01; the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped 0.02 to 258.99 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index eased 0.11 to 442.71.
The Nasdaq Composite Index, though, managed a gain of 0.72 to 793.52, partly aided by a second day of strength in technology stocks.
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index added 0.07 to 468.13.

GE shares eased 3/8 to 104 7/8.
Shares of mutual-fund companies rallied on the Kemper bid.
Analysts said that GE Capital's motivation in pursuing Kemper might be tied in part to efforts to bolster GE Capital's mutual-fund and annuities business.

Elsewhere, Compania de Telefonos de Chile slumped 15 3/4 to 100 1/2 before trading was halted.
The telephone service company said a move by Chilean regulators to establish tariffs would hurt its business.
The stock didn't resume trading yesterday following the midday halt.

Other biotechnology issues were mixed.
Amgen fell 3/4 to 39 1/4, while Genzyme was unchanged at 28 1/4, both on Nasdaq.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a small stock, tumbled 4 3/8 to 8 3/4 on Nasdaq after disappointing news about a drug it is developing to treat Lou Gehrig's disease.
In yesterday's trading, from a technical standpoint, bonds might have been more attractive than stocks.
Peter Canelo, a market strategist at NatWest Securities, noted that although the bond market started yesterday near its recent lows, the Dow Jones average was about 100 points above the intraday low it set March 2.
"Stocks are clearly ahead of bonds.
They are due for a little rest," he said.
"I think what you may have had today is part of a rush back into the bond market," said Philip Smyth, an analyst at Birinyi Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., market research firm.
"The focus possibly was to buy bonds even at the expense of liquidating stocks a little bit," he said.
