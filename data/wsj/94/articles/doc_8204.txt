Domestic production and sales by Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., Japan's two largest car makers, continued to slide in December.
Both Toyota and Nissan also reported a sharp decline in their domestic production and sales for the calendar year 1993.
While overseas production by both companies soared from the 1992 levels, their auto exports from Japan showed sharp decreases, affected by sluggish economies world-wide and the appreciation of the yen.
A rise in the yen's value against other currencies makes exports more expensive for Japanese manufacturers.
In December, Toyota held a 29% share of the Japanese market, down 2.3 percentage points from a year earlier.
Nissan said it had a 21.1% share in the domestic market in December, down 0.4 percentage point from a year earlier.
Toyota's December overall production -- a combination of passenger cars and commercial vehicles -- within Japan totaled 246,634 units, down 20% from a year earlier, while domestic sales plummeted 15% to 135,636.
In December, Nissan's total domestic output fell 24% to 117,494 units, with domestic sales falling 13% to 72,865.
For all of 1993, Toyota said total sales fell 7.4% to 2,065,000 units.
Production fell 9.4%, to 3,562,000 cars.
The company ended the year with a 31.9% share in the Japanese market, down 0.2 percentage point from the previous year.
Nissan's domestic sales declined 8.4% to 1,098,000 units in 1993 from the previous year, with its market share staying steady at 22.5%
Total vehicle sales in Japan during 1993 were roughly 6,470,000 units, down around 490,000 units from the 1992 level, Toyota noted.
Outside of the Japanese market, Toyota said a decrease in exports to North America, Europe and the Middle East more than offset an increase in its Asia and Oceania sales, pushing down the total export figure to 1,132,000, down 11% from a year earlier.
Overseas output, however, jumped 16% from the previous year to 888,559 cars, because of increased truck production at its British operations and the start of normal production at a plant in California.
Nissan's auto exports were depressed by 27% on the year to 684,088 units amid sluggish economies in major consuming countries.
However, its overseas production continued to increase steadily, reaching 1,006,000 units, up 17% from the previous year.
