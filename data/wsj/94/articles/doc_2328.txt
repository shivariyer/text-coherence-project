TransCanada PipeLines Ltd., Calgary, Alberta, asked Canada's National Energy Board for permission to add 120.1 million Canadian dollars (US$88.3 million) of new pipeline and natural-gas-compression facilities to its existing gas-pipeline system in Ontario and Quebec.
The pipeline company said it wants to build 17.4 miles of pipeline and 42.3 megawatts of new compression to transport 69.4 million cubic feet of gas a day and provide 20 million cubic feet a day of gas-storage transportation service.
It said that if its application is approved, construction would start next year, and the new facilities could come into service by Nov. 1, 1995.
