Timberland Co.'s stock fell 19% after the company reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter results attributed to price cuts in its outdoor-shoe line.
The company also confirmed that it forecast a profitless first six months of 1994 in a conference call with securities analysts.
The prediction heightened Wall Street's fears about the damage that Timberland will incur from low-priced outdoor shoes introduced by competitors, including Nike Inc. and Reebok International Ltd.
Analysts said that in its fight for market share, the company's price cuts on certain product lines have hurt profit margins.
Shares of Timberland, which is based in Hampton, N.H., tumbled $9.875, to $43.50 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.
For the fourth quarter, Timberland's net income rose 46% to $7 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with net of $4.8 million, or 44 cents a share.
Analysts were expecting the latest quarterly results to be 65 cents a share.
Sales rose 40% to $123.2 million compared with $88.6 million in the year-ago quarter.
Analysts said the company maintained in its Friday conference call that it is still comfortable with expectations of 1994 net income of $3 a share.
They also said the company forecast that price cuts would shave $10 million off gross profits, or profits before taxes and interest, in 1994.
The company declined to discuss these and other details of the call.
Analysts remained cautious.
"I'm skeptical.
I've lowered my 1994 estimate from $3.35 to $2.75," said Steven Frankel, an analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill Inc.
Timberland's niche of outdoor shoes and boots recently has attracted more competition as fashion trends have shifted from the 1980s sneaker boom.
With the addition of Nike, Reebok and others, the market has grown crowded, prompting price cuts.
Timberland's top-of-the-line footwear has retailed at $169 in the past, but the company now offers some shoes as low as $75.
But Mr. Frankel said the Timberland boot is still a product that consumers want.
"The company suffers from an inability to meet demand," he said.
"Management still has problems accurately forecasting the business and delivering the products on time."
For 1993, Timberland reported a 74% increase in net to $22.5 million, or $2.01 a share, on a 44% sales increase to $418.9 million.
For 1992, the concern had net of $12.9 million, or $1.18 a share, on sales of $291.4 million.
