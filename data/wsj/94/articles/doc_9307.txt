Morgan Grenfell Group PLC's Asian subsidiary said it lured a senior stock analyst from Barings PLC's Baring Securities unit to head its regional securities operations, signaling that the heated game of musical chairs in Asia's securities industry continues.
Morgan Grenfell, a unit of Deutsche Bank AG, said Stuart Cook, 39 years old, will join the Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities arm of Morgan Grenfell Asia Holdings on Jan. 24 as chief executive officer.
The British merchant bank's Asian operations in Singapore include investment banking, fund management and securities research and trading.
Morgan Grenfell's Asian securities operation is active in six markets: Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.
The securities operation has sales teams in Asia and New York, and is setting up an Asian sales team in London.
Colin Berry, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Asia Holdings, said Mr. Cook "will be responsible for all securities operations" at Morgan Grenfell Asia.
Mr. Cook said he was attracted to Morgan Grenfell by the opportunity to take on broader responsibilities and the chance to help build Morgan Grenfell's Asian securities business.
"I didn't think there was any place to go at Barings," Mr. Cook said, noting that Barings was already ranked No. 1 in the region.
Mr. Cook was Asian regional research director at Baring Securities in Hong Kong.
Baring Securities ranked No. 1 overall in 1993 for the third consecutive year among Asian stock brokerage firms in Asiamoney magazine's annual poll of institutional investors.
Mr. Cook declined to comment in detail on his salary at Morgan Grenfell.
"I think it's a very reasonable package," he said.
Morgan Grenfell is well-established in Singapore and has been expanding in Hong Kong, but it isn't as big a player across the region as some other firms, including Baring Securities.
