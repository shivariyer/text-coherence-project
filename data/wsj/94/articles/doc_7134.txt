Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc. said it will spend $160 million this year on capital projects, down from $192 million last year.
The oil and gas company said the 17% decline primarily reflects lower development spending in the United Kingdom North Sea following the completion of the Piper and Saltire projects last year.
