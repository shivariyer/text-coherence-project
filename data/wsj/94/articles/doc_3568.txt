The pact would mark the first time that two regional Bell telephone companies have linked up to enter what the industry hopes will become a booming market for new pocket-phone and data services.
It would let Nynex and PacTel's new cellular operation, known as AirTouch Communications Inc., pool capital and technical expertise to bid for the new PCS licences, which may fetch up to $10 billion for the federal government.
Nynex and PacTel declined to comment.
Although the two companies had scheduled a news conference for today, they abruptly canceled it last night and didn't say when an announcement might be made.
PCS was touted as the big new rival to cellular phone service, eventually offering seamless wireless communications targeted at the consumer market and capable of operating where cellular can't, such as inside buildings and tunnels.
But the Federal Communications Commission, which had been expected to begin auctioning off up to seven licenses in each market across the country starting in May, now may face delays.
The delay could provide an opportunity for another rival for PCS-like services, dubbed SMR for specialized mobile radio.
The SMR approach got a boost this week when MCI Communications Corp. said it would pay $1.3 billion for a 17% stake in wireless upstart Nextel Communications Inc.
The Baby Bells are virtually barred from competing for the biggest chunk of PCS licenses in their home territories if they already have a major presence in the cellular market.
They will be allowed to bid for a smaller part of the spectrum in such cases.
More important, however, Nynex and the PacTel unit would be able to bid aggressively for licenses in regions in which they don't offer cellular service.
