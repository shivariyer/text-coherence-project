In the article "Secrets of the Heart," Feb. 14, is the following statement: "The electrocardiogram, of course, is a record of the electrical impulses the nervous system sends through the heart muscle to trigger each beat."
The heartbeat originates within the heart and is not triggered by the nervous system.
The neural input to the heart serves to regulate the rate of beating, but does not "trigger each beat."
