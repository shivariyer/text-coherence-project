EATON Corp., Cleveland, said it sold 2.1 million common shares in a private sale, raising $99.9 million in net proceeds.
Eaton, a maker of vehicle-powertrain components and controls for industries including transportation, said it is using the money to redeem $89.3 million outstanding of 8 1/2% debentures due Jan. 15, 2017, cutting its interest cost.
The stock sale also is part of the company's financing for its pending $1.1 billion acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s distribution and controls unit.
Eaton plans to sell an additional $200 million of common stock to help finance the acquisition, which the company hopes to close by mid-February.
At Dec. 31, Eaton had 71.3 million common shares outstanding.
