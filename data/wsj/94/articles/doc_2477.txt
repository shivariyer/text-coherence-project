Fleet Financial Group Inc., as expected, announced a cost-cutting initiative in which it plans to shed 4,250 jobs, or about 15% of its work force, within the next year.
The bank-holding company said it will lay off 3,000 employees and eliminate 1,250 workers through attrition.
Additionally, 1,250 positions left vacant during a hiring freeze will not be filled.
The cuts in Fleet's work force of 27,500, plus restructuring of operations, are aimed at reducing operating expenses by $300 million annually.
Fleet also says it is taking steps, including tighter rules for fee waivers, that it expects will generate more than $50 million in additional income.
The job cuts will affect only Fleet's banking businesses and 20,600 bank employees in five New England states and New York.
The restructuring will yield an additional $25 million charge in the 1994 first quarter.
In the 1993 third quarter, Fleet took a $125 million restructuring charge to cover severance payments and office-closings linked to the initiative.
Fleet wants to improve profitability and reduce its current efficiency ratio -- or cost per dollar of revenue -- to about 55% by mid-1995 from the current 67%.
Fleet, with $48 billion in assets, reported net income for 1993 of $488 million, or $3.01 a share.
