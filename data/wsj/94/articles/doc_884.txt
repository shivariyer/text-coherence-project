Reliance Electric Co.'s Reliance Comm/Tec Corp. subsidiary said in Cleveland that it entered into a cooperative agreement with Oracle Corp. to develop and market interactive multimedia systems to computer network providers.
Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., supplies information management systems for the delivery of interactive services.
The venture will combine Reliance's Matrix system and Oracle's Media Net and Media Server products to telephone, cable television and wireless operators for upgrading networks to transport new multimedia voice, video and data services.
The Matrix system will provide transmission of voice, video data and wireless communications over all distribution media including copper wire, fiber-optic cable, coaxial cable and fiber-coax networks, the company said.
Media Net is an open, high-level protocol that will be used to connect users requesting on-demand services through television sets to the Media Server, a digital multimedia library that delivers the requested services to the user.
