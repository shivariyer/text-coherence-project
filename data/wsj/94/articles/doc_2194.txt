The Hughes Aircraft Co. unit of General Motors Corp. said an international arbitration panel awarded it more than $23 million to settle damage claims filed against General Electric Co. of Britain and several subsidiaries.
Hughes said that the London Court of International Arbitration upheld allegations "of a breach of contract and inappropriate business practices" by British GE.
British GE isn't related to General Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn.
Hughes, based in Los Angeles, initially filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., at the end of 1990, seeking at least $600 million from British GE and four related companies.
The suit accused the defendants of sabotaging a bid to provide radars for the European Fighter Aircraft program.
In the late 1980s, Hughes and British GE were part of a team competing to supply the radars.
But after British GE acquired a division of Ferranti International PLC, British GE terminated its relationship with Hughes.
The team led by Ferranti International eventually won the radar contract.
Hughes alleged that British GE violated confidentiality and other agreements.
