Nissan Motor Corp.'s U.S. unit agreed to settle federal false-advertising charges stemming from its "Nissan Challenge" promotional campaign.
In the campaign, the company said it would pay $100 to anybody who buys either a Toyota Camry or a Honda Accord after test-driving a Nissan Stanza.
The ads said "there's no catch" to the offer.
But the Federal Trade Commission said that consumers had to meet significant conditions to qualify for the $100 payment.
They had to purchase the Accord or Camry, take delivery of it and submit proof of the purchase to Nissan, all within seven days of the test drive, the FTC charged.
In addition, it said, the other conditions couldn't be met on the same day the consumer took the test-drive.
To settle the charges, the Japanese auto-maker's unit, agreed to disclose restrictions clearly in its ads.
"Nissan believes the promotion, as run, was fair, accurate, and complied with all legal requirements," Nissan said in a prepared statement.
