Three Ohio banks have purchased for $12 million the Ohio assets of Citizens Federal Bank, a unit of CSF Holdings Inc. of Miami.
The transaction involves 13 banking offices with about $464 million in deposits, operating under the name of Equitable Savings.
Fifth Third Bancorp of Cincinnati purchased eight offices with deposits of $305 million, Charter One Bank FS of Cleveland bought four offices with $112 million in deposits, and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Wooster acquired one with $47 million in deposits.
Citizens Federal, with about $4.4 billion in assets in Florida, California, Ohio and Virginia, entered Ohio in 1986 when it acquired Equitable Savings.
It expects to record a profit of about $8 million from the sale.
