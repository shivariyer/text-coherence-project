British Petroleum Co. reported a sharp drop in fourth-quarter net income, when it took hefty charges for restructuring its unprofitable petrochemical operations and for closing facilities.
For the entire year, however, net totaled #1.13 billion ($1.65 billion) on a replacement-cost basis, more than double the #536 million recorded for 1992.
BP said fourth-quarter profit dropped to #54 million -- on a replacement cost basis and after exceptional items -- from #193 million in the final quarter of 1992.
Even so, David Simon, BP's chief executive, said in an interview that the fourth-quarter results were "satisfactory, given the level of oil prices."
Oil prices plunged in the fourth quarter, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided it wouldn't try to prop up the market by cutting output further.
Replacement-cost accounting excludes the impact on changes in inventory valuations.
But they are reflected in historic cost accounting, a basis on which BP recorded a loss of #97 million in the fourth quarter, contrasting with net income of #136 million in the final period of 1992.
Of the #284 million of exceptional charges in the fourth quarter, #200 million were for restructuring European petrochemical operations, including the closure of a facility in Baglan Bay, Wales.
Another #60 million were charged to close a refinery in Hamburg, Germany.
Analysts noted that BP's current share price has more than doubled since 1992, when the company slashed its dividend and embarked on both a program of asset disposals to reduce its debt and a cost-cutting program to improve its performance.
Nonetheless, many analysts, weighing the share rise and the low oil prices, say the stock is losing its allure.
In trading yesterday, BP fell back after initial gains.
Shares ended at 386 pence, down 4.5 pence, after climbing to 406.5 pence earlier.

Group sales totaled #8.2 billion in the fourth quarter, down from #9.8 billion a year earlier.
Sales totaled #34.95 billion for all 1993, up from #33.25 billion in 1992.
