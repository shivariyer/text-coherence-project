Vowing to become the beverage leader of Eastern Europe by the turn of the century, Pepsi-Cola International announced plans to invest more than $115 million in Czech Republic and Slovakia over the next five years.
The move comes in the wake of similar expansions that the unit's parent company, PepsiCo Inc., has launched over recent years in Poland, Hungary and parts of Russia, putting the company's total commitment to the region at well over $1 billion.
About half of the $85 million PepsiCo has earmarked for expansion in Czech Republic will be spent to overhaul a manufacturing and bottling plant here.
Work on the building began early this month and is expected to be completed by year end.
The rest of the money will go toward building a new sales and distribution network and will include the hiring and training of 500 new employees.
In Slovakia, PepsiCo said it plans to spend about $30 million over five years, most of it on 200 new jobs and on a network of six regional distribution centers and warehouses.
