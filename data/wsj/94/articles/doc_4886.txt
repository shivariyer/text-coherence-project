Concerning your Jan. 13 Enterprise article, the "spying" allegations made in {franchisee Richard} Cohn's case against Taco Bell are absolutely and unequivocally false.
We do not condone the use of such tactics, nor do we use them in any of our restaurants or operations.
Taco Bell Corp., which has flourished to a $4.2 billion world-wide system of more than 10,000 points of access, is built on a foundation of highest integrity and sound business practices.
You correctly reported the federal court's dismissal of the encroachment allegations made by Mr. Cohn against Taco Bell.
That was Mr. Cohn's original complaint against us, and the court ruled in our favor.
The so-called "spying" charges were added almost a year later, when Mr. Cohn and his attorneys realized they had no case against us on encroachment.
