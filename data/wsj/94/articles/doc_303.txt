The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading in the common stock of Commodore International Ltd., the personal computer maker that said last week it may face liquidation.
The Big Board said trading would be suspended while it determines whether Commodore, based in West Chester, Pa., remains eligible for listing on the exchange.
The exchange didn't elaborate, and Commodore didn't make a spokesman available for comment.
