The government's January employment report, which will be released Friday, will reflect an adjustment for the 1990 census undercount of the U.S. population, Bureau of Labor Statistics officials said.
The change is likely to bump the unemployment rate up 0.1 percentage point for the whole year.
The one-time adjustment is separate from previously announced changes that will take effect with the January report.
Those changes, which result from a new questionnaire and the use of computers to record survey respondents, are expected to knock the unemployment rate up 0.5 percentage point over time.
(The unemployment rate in December was 6.4%.)
Adjusting for the census undercount will boost the estimated size of the labor force by roughly 1.1 million people.
It will increase the number of employed by about 934,000, and swell the ranks of unemployed by about 200,000, said Thomas Plewes, associate BLS commissioner.
The 1990 census failed to count many inner-city dwellers, particularly Hispanics and blacks.
Mr. Plewes said the undercount of Hispanics is the main reason the unemployment rate will rise by 0.1 percentage point.
Hispanics are a fast-growing segment of the population and unemployment is high among that group.
In December, it stood at 10.5%.
To facilitate historical comparisons, the bureau will provide unemployment figures for December and January using both the old and new methods.
The BLS also said that when the new version of its Current Population Survey is released this week, it no longer will contain separate employment data on Vietnam veterans.
The bureau said it will continue to keep track of the data, and people will be able to call in for the information.
