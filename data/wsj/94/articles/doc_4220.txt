Mirage Resorts Inc. said it is a 49% partner in a proposal to develop a hotel, casino, convention center and cruise-ship terminal complex on a waterfront property in Vancouver, British Columbia.
The Las Vegas casino operator and its Canadian partner, closely held development company VLC Properties Ltd., have been given the go-ahead by Vancouver Port Corp. to negotiate a financial arrangement and lease for the 750 million Canadian dollar (US$555.6 million) development proposed for 48 acres of prime waterfront land in downtown Vancouver.
However, the project depends on the outcome of a promised overhaul of British Columbia's gaming laws, which currently don't allow operation of resort-type casinos, such as the one proposed by the VLC-Mirage group.
Mirage Vice-President of Public Relations Allan Feldman said that in its proposal to Vancouver Port, the group forecast annual casino revenue of about C$350 million a year.
