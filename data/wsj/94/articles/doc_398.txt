The European Union Commission said it has cleared investment subsidies of #11.2 million ($16.8 million) to Jaguar Cars, a wholly owned unit of Ford Motor Co., for its new luxury sports car line.
The new line of luxury cars, known as X100, will replace the XJS line, which was introduced in 1975.
It will include an improved engine with lower emissions.
The commission said the subsidies will be paid in four installments between 1994 and 1997, against progress on the project.
There are provisions for withholding or clawing back the grants "if there is underachievement."
The subsidies will support investment in plants at Birmingham, Coventry and Liverpool in Britain.
The commission said the project will increase competition in the sector, but doesn't cause competition concerns because the investment won't be used to increase capacity.
