House members voted 390-1 to extend until Dec. 31, 1995, the statute of limitations for the Resolution Trust Corp. to pursue civil actions against thrifts it concludes were managed fraudulently.
Without the extension, the RTC's authority to pursue civil actions against Madison would expire Feb. 28.
Recently appointed special counsel Robert Fiske is looking into ties between Madison and Whitewater Development Corp., in which Mr. Clinton and his wife were investors.
When Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York pressed for an extension in the case of Madison, Democratic senators struck a compromise covering all failed thrifts.
On Wednesday, the Senate unanimously approved the compromise as an amendment to an emergency-spending bill to aid Los Angeles earthquake victims.
The House yesterday instructed its negotiators to accept the amendment in a conference committee with the Senate.
Both chambers are expected to give final approval to the measure today, and send it to President Clinton for his signature.
