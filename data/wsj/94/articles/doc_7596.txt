Greater New York Savings Bank reported fourth-quarter net income more than doubled, predominantly due to a recognition of $1.3 million in tax benefits.
The company reported net income of $1.2 million, or five cents a share, up sharply from the year-earlier profit of $490,000.
Without the tax benefits the company probably would have reported a loss.
For the full year Greater New York recorded a $14.7 million net loss, or $1.25 a share, compared with net income of $13.7 million, or 92 cents a share, largely because of a $15 million loan loss provision incurred in the third quarter.
The company took a big provision to accelerate the sale of problem assets.
However, nonperforming assets fell 15% in the fourth quarter to $186 million.
"We expect continued progress in the planned reduction of nonperforming assets in the coming year," said Gerard Keegan, chairman and president.
