GTE Corp. said its GTE Airfone unit received a contract from Trans World Airlines to provide advanced airplane-telephone service.
The GenStar digital system will allow passengers to receive calls placed from the ground in addition to making outbound calls.
The new system replaces an analog service available on some TWA aircraft.
The contract covers about 200 current and future aircraft in the TWA fleet.
