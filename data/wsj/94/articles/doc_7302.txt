Machine-tool orders jumped 37% to $319.1 million in December from November's $232.3 million as the industry's recovery broadened beyond orders from automotive makers.
December's healthy order increase capped a strong year for the industry.
Orders climbed 32% last year to $3.28 billion from $2.48 billion in 1992, according to the Association for Manufacturing Technology, an industry trade group.
Domestic orders led the way, soaring nearly 40% to $2.99 billion from $2.14 billion.
In December, domestic orders climbed 30% to $282.5 million from $218.1 million in November and 64% from $171.9 million in December 1992.
The surge in orders for the year was largely fueled by auto makers, which were buying machine tools in their bids to boost productivity and turn out new products faster.
But as 1993 progressed orders climbed from other sectors, ranging from appliance makers to small job shops.
"We saw a good step-up in demand, and we don't think it's over yet," said Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
Mr. Lustgarten projects an 8% to 12% increase in orders this year.
Manufacturers will continue to buy new machine tools, which cut and form metal parts for other machines, as part of an "emphasis on productivity, improving the process," said Mr. Lustgarten.
He also sees a potential pickup in orders for export, which he said stabilized late last year.
In December, orders for export shot up 157% to $36.6 million from $14.3 million and rose 7% from $34.3 million in December 1992.
But for the year they fell 15% to $290.9 million from 1992's $341.7 million.
An economic recovery overseas could also spur higher domestic machine-tool orders as U.S. manufacturers gear up to meet demand for exports, said William G. Copeland, of Copeland Economics in Stamford, Conn.
Still, domestic auto-related orders should continue as a main propellant for machine-tool order growth in 1994, said Mr. Copeland, who last year predicted the 32% rise in orders and now projects a 12% to 15% increase this year.
"As much money as Detroit has spent in the last 12 months, I think there's going to be considerably more," he said.
General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG, which is building a plant in Alabama, should lead the way in ordering machine tools.
"GM is still playing cost and product-design catch-up," he said.
Machine-tool orders are considered economic harbingers because the products are shipped nine to 18 months after they are ordered.
