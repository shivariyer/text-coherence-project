Edward F. Covell, who had been president, was given new duties in a reorganization designed to increase competitiveness.
Mr. Covell, 50 years old, will now head the company's intravenous drug-device division.
MedChem said the position of president will remain open and that Jonathan Donaldson, chief executive officer, will continue to run the company.
MedChem said the reorganization will allow the maker of specialty medical products to focus on increasing its business in a competitive environment.
As part of the changes, Bradford R. Gay, 40, was named president of MedChem's surgical division, which makes devices used to coagulate blood.
Mr. Gay had been senior vice president for sales and marketing.
