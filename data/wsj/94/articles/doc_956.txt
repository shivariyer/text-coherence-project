A boost in the prime rate by several large banks helped drive bond prices lower.
Stock prices and the dollar were mixed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.91 points to 3869.46.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index edged down 0.26 to 468.54, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.17 to 797.51.
Bond prices traded in a narrow range until the afternoon, when they slumped after several banks raised the prime rate to 6.25% from 6%.
The prime rate is the rate commercial banks charge on loans to their biggest borrowers.
Tuesday, the Federal Reserve decided to raise short-term interest rates.
"This means interest rates -- from the federal funds rate to the prime rate -- are trending upward," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
"Though the rise in the prime rate was expected, the bond market was somewhat discouraged."
He added that the bond market's decline was also due to profit-taking after Tuesday's surge.
Stock prices were boosted by economically sensitive stocks as investors bet that the recovery remains on track despite rising interest rates.
But investors are still worried about further Fed rate increases, said Ralph Bloch, market strategist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
"There's a third shoe out there still to drop," he said.
Overseas, some Asia/Pacific markets soared.
The Hong Kong stock market jumped 5%; Singapore, 3.2%; Thailand, 4%; and Malaysia, 3.4%.
Markets in Australia, Taiwan and the Philippines also rallied.
William Murray, a director at Baring Securities Ltd. in London, said Asian investors were relieved by the Fed's modest move on rates.
Also, the flow of funds to the Japanese market from smaller Southeast Asian markets has slowed from its vigorous pace earlier in the year.
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index lost 0.09 to 114.95.
Stock prices were mixed.
Volume totaled 281.4 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,159 issues rose and 945 fell.
Bond prices fell.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue lost more than 1/2 point, or more than $5 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.89%.
The dollar was mixed.
In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.6802 marks and 106.25 yen, compared with 1.6885 marks and 106.00 yen Tuesday.
