Heilig-Meyers Co. expects earnings growth for its fiscal fourth quarter and year to be on track with the strong 43% increase of the first nine months, Troy A. Peery Jr., president, said.
In an interview, Mr. Peery, who is also chief operating officer of the specialty furniture retailer, said analysts are estimating per-share earnings of $1.05 to $1.10, or $51.2 million to $53.7 million, for the fiscal year ended Feb. 28.
"We're going to be in that range or at the upper end of it, is my guess," Mr. Peery said.
He said sales also will be up for the quarter and the year, but not as much as profit.
In the previous full year, Heilig-Meyers had net income of 83 cents a share, or $38 million, restated for a 3-for-2 stock split last June.
Revenue for the previous year totaled $657.5 million.
Analysts are looking for fourth-quarter per-share earnings of 25 cents to 27 cents, or a total of about $12.6 million to $13.6 million.
Mr. Peery says he is comfortable with those estimates.
In the year-earlier quarter, Heilig-Meyers had restated net income of 21 cents a share, or $9.6 million, on sales of $182.4 million.
Heilig-Meyers will report earnings March 23.
Sales have been running at a brisk pace.
For the month of February, sales rose 41% to $66.5 million from $47.3 million in February 1993.
Same-store sales were up 12.5%.
For the 12 months, sales rose 32% to $723.3 million, compared with $549.7 million a year earlier.
Same-store sales were up 12.1%.
Heilig-Meyers operates 570 stores in 22 states, primarily in the Southeast, Midwest and West.
Mr. Peery believes there is room for expansion and is planning to open 60 stores in the current fiscal year.
