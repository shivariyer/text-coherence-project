Glaxo Holdings PLC named Robert A. Ingram chief executive officer of its U.S. unit, Glaxo Inc., effective March 1, succeeding Charles A. Sanders.
The drug company said Dr. Sanders, 62 years old, will relinquish his role as chief executive of Glaxo Inc. in order to spearhead Glaxo's relationship with U.S. health-care policy makers.
He will, however, continue as the unit's chairman.
Glaxo Inc. had revenue of $3.2 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993.
Mr. Ingram, 51, currently president and chief operating officer, will retain the title of president, but "there are no plans" to fill the position of chief operating officer, a spokesman said.
Glaxo said Mr. Ingram will be responsible for day-to-day running of Glaxo, as well as formulating its strategic business plans.
The spokesman noted that Mr. Ingram will continue Glaxo's effort to market "innovative products that can demonstrate cost effectiveness."
