Recorded music revenue showed double-digit gains in 1993 led by surging sales of compact disks, but the increases weren't as sharp as in 1992.
The Recording Industry Association of America, a Washington trade group, said music sales rose more than 11% in 1993, to $10 billion compared with $9 billion a year earlier.
Unit sales, including cassette tapes, compact disks, music videos and records, reached 955.6 million, an increase of 6.7%.
Those figures would have been higher except that the trade group eliminated a category for "liquidated or dumped" merchandise, mostly bargain-priced closeouts.
Tim Sites, an association spokesman, said year-end figures would have reflected an additional 1% in units, and about half-a-percent in dollar value if liquidated goods were included.
By means of comparison, music revenue increased 15% in 1992 compared with 1991 levels, while unit sales in 1992 were up almost 12%.
In both those years, liquidated-merchandise figures were included.
"The industry had a very strong year in 1993 when you look at the actual dollar increase in spending," said Michael Shalett, chief operating officer of SoundScan Inc. of Hartsdale, N.Y., which compiles the sales numbers for the Billboard magazine charts.
"If you look at the top 20 records at Christmas, there were rappers, saloon crooners, rock operas, and saxophonists -- something to draw everyone into the record store."
Mr. Shalett noted that the year's biggest sellers included records by the alternative rock group Pearl Jam, whose "Vs." and "Ten" sold six million units on a combined basis; "The Bodyguard" soundtrack, which sold close to 5.5 million copies; singer Janet Jackson's self-titled record, which sold 4.3 million, and saxophonist Kenny G's "Breathless" album which sold 3.8 million.
According to SoundScan data, music unit sales through Feb. 20, l994, were flat compared with the same period in 1993.
Harsh winter weather has plagued retailers nationwide since the Christmas selling season.
Wall Street analysts suggested that the slowdown in revenue and unit growth in 1993 may indicate that music buffs may have finished converting their libraries from records and cassettes to compact disks.
"There is always a period when new formats drive sales, as we've seen with compact disks," said Lisbeth Barron, an entertainment industry analyst with S.G. Warburg.
"But after people have taken advantage of that new format, sales growth begins to slow."
Ms. Barron predicted that music revenue will increase 8% to 10% in 1994.
One encouraging sign was that music buyers over the age of 35 increased their spending by 4.1% compared with 1992 levels, the trade association noted.
Adults aged 20 and over accounted for 76% of all music purchases, compared with 74% a year earlier.
As expected, compact disks were the largest and fastest-growing format.
Unit sales totaled 495.4 million, a 22% increase from 1992, while dollar spending was up 22% to $6.5 billion.
By comparison, shoppers spent $2.9 billion on music cassettes, down 6.4% compared with 1992, while cassette unit sales fell 7.3% to 339.5 million.
Music videos generated $213.3 million, up 36% from the year earlier, while unit sales jumped 45% to 11 million.
"What you're seeing is a fast-growing industry which is becoming increasingly competitive," said Paul Cardinal, general counsel to Trans World Music Corp., a music retailer based in Albany, N.Y. which operates 700 stores under such names as Record Town, Tape World, Coconuts and Saturday Matinee.
"Every retail music chain is growing.
At the same time, promotion-minded electronic retailers like Circuit City have gotten into the business."
As a result, Mr. Cardinal said, record store profit margins will be under greater pressure as merchants become increasingly price-minded.
Rock music generated the most interest among shoppers, accounting for nearly 33% of the $10 billion market, while country music contributed about 18%.
Rap music produced 7.8% of all sales, down from 7.9% in 1992, according to the trade group.
