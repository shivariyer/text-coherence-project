General Motors Corp. said it reached a tentative labor contract at its assembly plant in Oklahoma City, averting a possible strike.
Both GM and the United Auto Workers union declined to release specifics on the tentative pact, which still must be ratified by rank-and-file union members.
Before the settlement, the union said its biggest complaint was repetitive stress injuries caused by a faster work pace in the factory.
Mike Hermes, vice president for UAW Local 1999, said the new agreement will resolve that issue but wouldn't say how.
The Oklahoma City plant, which employs 4,450 hourly workers, builds the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and Buick Century midsize cars.
