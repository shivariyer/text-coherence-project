A group of seven toll-road agencies in the Northeast recommended Mark IV Industries Inc.'s technology over Amtech Corp.'s for a regional automated toll-collection system, sending Amtech's stock plummeting 34.2%.
The system would allow motorists to pay tolls without having to stop or fumble for change or tokens.
Instead, the system would use a tag that can be read electronically as the vehicle passes through the toll area.
The toll amount is then charged to the motorist's account.
Analysts estimate that a contract with the group, which collectively serves four million vehicles a day in three states, could total $80 million to $100 million over several years.
Installation is scheduled to begin in 1995 and to be completed by 1999.
The interagency group is to give its recommendation to the boards of the seven agencies, which operate roads, bridges and tunnels.
Amtech's stock closed at $21.375 a share, down $11.125, on very heavy volume in Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Mark IV stock closed at $20 a share, up 62.5 cents, or 3.2%.
Electronic toll-collection represents about a third of Amtech's sales, which rose 49% in 1993 to $59.4 million.
The company sells similar technology to railroads and shipping companies.
G. Russell Mortenson, Amtech's president and chief executive officer, said the decision would have "minimal impact" on the Dallas-based company's 1994 results.
But he added, "We did clearly want to win this for revenue in 1995."
In 1993, Amtech earned $16.4 million, or $1.10 a share.
Analysts project the company will earn 75 cents to 85 cents a share in 1994.
For Mark IV, an Amherst, N.Y., maker of electronic industrial equipment that is much bigger than Amtech, the contract would have a smaller impact.
Mark IV's mass-transit business accounts for 18% of its sales, which totaled $1.09 billion in the fiscal year ended Feb. 28, 1993.
Amtech's stock, which quadrupled in the years since its 1989 initial public offering, has in the past two years sustained wild swings on speculation about potential contracts.
Last Thursday and Friday, before the recommendation was announced, Amtech's trading volume jumped to nearly three times its usual level.
On Friday, Amtech shares traded at a record high of $33.75 before closing at $32.50.
Amtech's Mr. Mortenson said the company is considering whether to appeal the interagency group's recommendation, though he acknowledged Amtech would face "an uphill battle."
