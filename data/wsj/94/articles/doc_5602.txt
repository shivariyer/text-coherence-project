Hurt by high costs of sales and administration and slow tomato sales, Calgene Inc. reported a fiscal second-quarter loss.
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the biotechnology concern in Davis, Calif., posted a net loss of $10.8 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $6.3 million, or 28 cents a share.
Revenue rose to $6.3 million from $4.4 million.
For the six months, Calgene posted a loss of $21.2 million, or 86 cents a share, on revenue of $12.5 million, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $11.1 million, or 51 cents a share, on revenue of $9.7 million.
Calgene has said it expects to report a fiscal 1994 loss greater than its 1993 loss of $25.6 million, or $1.13 a share, because of delays in getting Food and Drug Administration approval for its genetically engineered Flavr Savr tomato.
