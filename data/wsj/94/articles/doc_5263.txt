Your Jan. 24 article "Getting Credit Where Credit Is Due" touches a problem.
We recently set up a merchant account.
Our findings suggest that hundreds of new businesses stall because of the unmet fundamental need to accept credit-card payment by phone.
In spite of our willingness to provide a collateral account -- removing all risk to the bank -- we were required to find a different service.
It bothers us that one of the two alternative services in our area was recently purchased by a subsidiary of a bank.
They are no longer accepting new accounts.
Obtaining a merchant-services account through a bank was a simple matter 10 years ago.
No amount of rationalization can explain why this should not be the case today.
