Cambridge Biotech Corp. said it hired a special counsel to investigate "certain transactions" that it said caused its outside auditors to suspend their audit.
The biotech company in Worcester, Mass., which develops vaccines and diagnostics for humans and animals said its independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche, suspended work on their audit of its financial statements for fiscal 1993 because of "concerns about certain transactions," and their possible impact on the company's financial results.
James C. Bass, chief financial officer, said that "We cannont determine whether or not a fraud has been committed."
The company said in a news release that on the basis of the concerns reported by the auditors, it has engaged special counsel to assist a special committee of independent directors in investigating the matter.
Officials declined further comment on the matter or on whether any executives have been suspended or fired in connection with the auditor's concerns.
