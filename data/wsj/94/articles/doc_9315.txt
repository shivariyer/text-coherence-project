Haggar Corp., riding one of the hottest trends in apparel, said it will manufacture a new line of boys' pants in its wrinkle-resistant cotton material.
The new line, which Haggar expects to have in stores for the back-to-school market this summer, marks the company's return to boys' wear after a three-decade absence.
The men's apparel maker also said it is launching a line of wrinkle-resistant cotton sports shirts to supplement its pants.
Haggar shares closed yesterday at $26.50, unchanged, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Analysts said Haggar is a leader in this apparel niche and that many rivals, such as Levi Strauss & Co., are scrambling to catch up.
"It's going to move into every category," said Brenda Gall, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co., "but Haggar is ahead of the game. . . ."
Frank Bracken, executive vice president of the apparel maker, said, "We know how long it took us to get the technology straight and the production up, and we think we have an 18-month-to-two-year lead."
Haggar, and to a lesser extent its smaller competitor Farah Inc., have enjoyed success marketing men's cotton pants that are treated to resist wrinkling.
Mr. Bracken said that since October 1992, Haggar's share of the men's pants market increased to 15% from 2%, based entirely on its wrinkle-resistant line.
Mr. Bracken said Haggar spent $23 million advertising the pants in its 1993 fiscal year, which ended Oct. 1, trebling the company's ad spending from the previous year.
While Farah had a product on the market first, it didn't have the financial ability to market it as aggressively as Haggar, said Edward F. Johnson, director of Johnson Redbook Service.
