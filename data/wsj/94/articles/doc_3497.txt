Union Pacific Railroad Co. said a federal judge forced striking railroad work crews to return to work less than five hours after a strike was called on Tuesday.
A U.S. District Court judge here issued a temporary restraining order at the company's request.
The order is valid until this morning, when a hearing related to the dispute is scheduled.
About 7,100 brakemen, conductors and yardmen, representing one-quarter of the railroad work force, walked off the job in a dispute about transportation of crews to and from terminals in company-owned vehicles.
The United Transportation Union said it had called the strike because Union Pacific Railroad was "requiring" the crews to drive the vehicles between their locker rooms and trains, though it wasn't part of the worker's duties.
"This walkout was totally unnecessary," said Richard K. Davidson, chairman of Union Pacific Corp., parent of the railroad, which operates in 19 Western states.
"It really blindsided us."
He said the strike had disrupted transportation of equipment and materials to thousands of railroad customers, including the nation's auto makers.
