NL Industries Inc. said it reached a settlement in litigation against Lockheed Corp. and Lockheed's directors, in which Lockheed paid the chemical producer $27 million.
The litigation grew out of a battle by Dallas investor Harold Simmons, who controls NL Industries, to acquire the Calabasas, Calif.-based defense contractor.
At issue was a $500 million Lockheed employee stock-ownership plan, which became instrumental in a proxy fight with NL Industries.
NL Industries contended the stock plan, which at the time controlled 17% of the company, unfairly allowed employees to vote shares well before the shares were alloted to their accounts or paid for.
In December 1992, a federal jury in Los Angeles found that certain of Lockheed's public disclosures during the proxy battle violated federal securities laws and ordered Lockheed to pay NL Industries $30 million.
Prior to that, a federal judge threw out portions of Mr. Simmons's claims alleging Lockheed directors breached fiduciary duties.
As a result, both parties filed appeals with the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
The settlement effectively ends those appeals, an NL Industries spokesman said.
In a statement, Mr. Simmons said he is satisfied with the resolution.
A Lockheed spokesman said the company believes the verdict finding the company liable was in error, but he added that it was in Lockheed's best interest to settle the dispute for the smaller amount.
He said the payment wouldn't materially affect Lockheed's financial status.
