Fairchild Corp., hurting from the recession in aircraft manufacturing, managed to post a fiscal second-quarter profit of $70.1 million, because of a one-time gain from the sale of assets.
For the three months ended Jan. 2, the company earned $4.35 a share, compared with a loss of $7.9 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier.
The Chantilly, Va., company said it had a pretax gain of $129.1 million from the sale of the company's 43.9% stake in Rexnord Corp., a Milwaukee maker of mechanical-transmission parts.
The aerospace, industrial products and communications services company said sales declined 9.6% to $105.4 million from $116.5 million.
Fairchild said its performance was "severely" affected by a drop in sales of aerospace fasteners, reflecting an ongoing decline in the aircraft industry.
Fairchild shares fell 12.5 cents to $4 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
