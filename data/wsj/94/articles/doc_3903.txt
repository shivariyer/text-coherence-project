Ohio Gov. George Voinovich complains on your Jan. 31 editorial page that the Environmental Protection Agency forces drinking water systems all over America to test for a pesticide that is used only in Hawaii to grow pineapples.
And on your Feb. 24 editorial page, Rep. John Mica (R., Fla.) used the example of the pineapple pesticide test to protest compliance costs resulting from EPA regulations.
Everyone agrees that the Safe Drinking Water Act should regulate only those contaminants that pose real health risks.
Unfortunately, the infamous pineapple pesticide happens to be one of them.
True, in recent years, DBCP was used only in Hawaii.
(It has since been banned entirely.)
But until 1979 this chemical was used throughout the U.S.
Almost 33 million pounds a year were applied to crops such as soybeans, cotton and peanuts.
DBCP is extremely persistent and still shows up at harmful levels in drinking water across the country -- including in Ohio.
Nine out of 10 Americans who drink public tap water pay an average monthly charge of $2 or less for all Safe Drinking Water Act standards.
Most believe it's a good investment.
In fact, a recent water utility trade association poll shows that 82% of Americans are willing to pay more if that is what it takes to meet federal safety standards.
In September, the Clinton administration proposed to reform the act to minimize the cost to communities, especially those served by small systems.
The EPA is also increasing its work with the states to waive monitoring requirements where they do not make sense.
