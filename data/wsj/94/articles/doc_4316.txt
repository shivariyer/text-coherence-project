Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. said it completed initial negotiations and awarded contracts on the first $220 million of $1.7 billion in annual supply purchases.
The health-care services provider, formed out of the recent merger of Columbia Healthcare Corp. and HCA-Hospital Corp. of America, said it is reviewing its supply contracts as a result of the merger.
The new contracts, which go into effect between March and June, will save the company about $60 million annually over current ones.
Most of the company's contracts are for one- or two-year terms.
Columbia/HCA named Owens & Minor Inc., Richmond, Va., as its prime distributor for medical and surgical products, including sutures, endoscopic instruments and syringes.
An Owens & Minor spokesman said his company also will distribute such products as gowns from Johnson & Johnson, which was awarded a contract in the current round of negotiations.
He added that details, such as length of the contract and distribution fees, are still being worked out.
The award to Owens & Minor was a significant setback for Baxter International Inc., Owens & Minor's chief competitor and the world's leading hospital supplier.
Baxter, which previously held about half of the business that Columbia/HCA just awarded, had negotiated unsuccessfully to retain it, Baxter officials said.
Furthermore, Baxter's U.S. hospital business has already been hit with declining profit margins in recent months.
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Owens & Minor's stock rose 87.5 cents to $26.125.
Columbia/HCA rose 75 cents to $43.50; and Baxter's stock fell 75 cents to $23.25.
Contracts also were awarded to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., DuPont Co. and Medline Industries Inc.
