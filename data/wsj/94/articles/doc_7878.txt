In a move that will cheer institutional investors, the National Association of Securities Dealers said yesterday that its board of governors approved granting access for non-NASD members to SelectNet, which allows members to negotiate and execute transactions via computer for Nasdaq-listed stocks.
The SelectNet modifications, which will be presented to the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval next month, would allow members and nonmembers alike to view any broadcast of an order by a market-maker and its execution, NASD said.
"Non-members would need to execute transactions via SelectNet through member firms," NASD said.
"Only market-makers would be able to interact with orders from firms that are not market makers," it added.
Institutional investors had lobbied for the change because they saw ample opportunity for improved price discovery in the system.
Richard Ketchum, NASD's chief operating officer, said: "Anytime that you can increase the amount of price and volume information available to the public, investors and traders alike gain inevitable benefits."
Separately, NASD said it would implement modifications to Nasdaq's Small Order Execution System beginning next Monday.
The path for implementation was cleared earlier this week when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied motions for a stay from petitioners.
The court said the petitioners had not "demonstrated the requisite irreparible injury."
