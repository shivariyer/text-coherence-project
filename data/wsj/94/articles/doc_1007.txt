Al Teller, chairman of MCA Music Entertainment Group, will be named an executive vice president of parent MCA Inc., according to people familiar with the situation.
The promotion, which is expected to be announced today, caps a series of successes for Mr. Teller, 49 years old.
For the week ended March 26, MCA Music Entertainment Group had six albums ranked in the top 25 of the Billboard 200, a list of top-selling albums compiled by SoundScan Inc., which tracks music sales.
He will remain in his music post, which he has held since 1989, but will take on additional responsibilities at MCA, the unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp. that includes Universal Studios and theme parks.
Mr. Teller was unavailable for comment, and a company spokeswoman declined to comment.
Although MCA Music Entertainment Group is one of the smallest of the six major record companies, it commands an impressive 11.6% of the U.S. domestic music business year to date, according to SoundScan figures.
Mr. Teller joined MCA Records in 1988 after serving as president of CBS Records, now part of Sony Corp., for three years.
In 1990, MCA Music Entertainment acquired Geffen Records from entrepreneur David Geffen for stock then valued at nearly $500 million.
It also bought GRP Records, a jazz and adulted-oriented music label.
In December 1993, MCA said it would open new record companies in Belgium, France, Holland, Italy, Spain and Sweden to complement those already established in Germany and Japan.
