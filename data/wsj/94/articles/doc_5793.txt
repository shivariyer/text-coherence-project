Laidlaw Inc. said it bought four ambulance companies, accelerating the company's push into the U.S. health-care transportation business.
Terms of the transactions weren't disclosed.
Laidlaw said the four companies, with combined revenue of $45 million a year, have operations in and around Grand Rapids, Mich.; Dallas; Denver; and Glendale, Calif.
Laidlaw in Burlington, Ontario, facing a profit margin squeeze in its big-solid and hazardous-waste operations, first moved into the medical-transport field last June.
With the latest acquisitions, the company said it now generates $125 million of annual revenue from this industry.
It also has interests in school-bus transportation.
Laidlaw had total revenue of $1.99 billion in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31.
