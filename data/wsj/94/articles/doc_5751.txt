America West Airlines made the unusual move of asking the U.S. bankruptcy court in Phoenix to prohibit the sale or transfer of its securities.
The carrier, which has been operating in Chapter 11 for almost three years, said it filed the motion to preserve the company's tax benefits.
The move drew fire from America West's equity committee, which said the action would hurt the value of the Phoenix-based airline's common shares.
Bond analysts said the company's motion was designed to prevent an unfriendly investor taking control by buying its debt securities, as Federated Department Stores Inc. has sought with R.H. Macy & Co.
"It's an antitakeover defense," said Phil Brannon, a high-yield bond analyst at Mabon Securities Corp.
America West has been in discussions with several possible investors, including New York money manager Michael Steinhardt, but no clear leader has emerged.
America West said it filed the court motion, affecting the carrier's general unsecured claims, debentures and stock, to protect the airline's net operating loss and tax-credit carry-forwards.
These tax assets can be lost when an investor acquires and reorganizes a company in bankruptcy court.
America West estimated the assets at $400 million after reorganization.
Tax experts said America West's request was unusual but not unprecedented and that some bankruptcy judges have granted similar requests.
But Benjamin Waisbran, an attorney representing America West's equity holders, said the move, if approved, would prevent the stock from realizing its full value.
America West "did this without regard to its primary constituency: the shareholders," Mr. Waisbran said.
Before trading was halted yesterday, America West stock traded at $1.96875, down 40.625 cents, or 17.1% on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
