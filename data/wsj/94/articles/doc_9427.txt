National Westminster Bank PLC became the second U.K. retail bank this week to announce sweeping job cuts, with reductions expected to total about 4,200, or 4.6% of its work force, this year.
NatWest, based in London, has around 2,700 branches, more than any of its rivals.
The bank has cut 15,000 jobs since 1990, bringing its current work force to about 92,600 world-wide.
Some 3,000 positions were eliminated last year in Britain.
On Monday, Barclays Bank said it would reduce its staff by 3,000 over the next two years.
The cuts came on top of reductions of 18,000 positions over a five-year period that began in 1991.
