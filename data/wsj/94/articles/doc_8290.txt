BEI Electronics Inc. said slow sales probably led to a loss of $1 million for its fiscal first quarter, ended Dec. 31, to be followed by a "probable" loss in the current quarter because of last week's Southern California earthquake.
The expected first-quarter loss, equal to about 15 cents a share, compares with net income of $711,000, or 11 cents a share, a year ago.
The company indicated in San Francisco that sales were lower than anticipated owing to poor demand for its rocket systems and other military products.
Sales in the year-ago period were $32.3 million.
The second-quarter results will be hurt by earthquake damage at three company manufacturing plants in Southern California, BEI said.
