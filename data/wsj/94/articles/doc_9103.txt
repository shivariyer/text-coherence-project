India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board cleared the acquisition by the country of a 5% stake in Motorola Inc.'s Iridium project, which plans to circle the globe with satellites for a world-wide cellular-phone system.
One or two routine bureaucratic clearances remain before the Indian stake is fully approved.
As part of the transaction, a consortium of Indian public-sector financial institutions, led by Industrial Development Bank of India, which will put up the $40 million for the stake, will obtain a seat on the Iridium board.
Others in the Indian consortium include the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services and the Export-Import Bank.
Motorola established Iridium Inc., an international group that plans to build by 1998 a $3.4 billion satellite system providing phone, data, fax and location services world-wide via small hand-held receivers.
Motorola has been selling off equity interests in Iridium and now owns a minority stake.
It has said it intends to reduce its stake to about 15%.
