Japan's Sony Corp., embroiled in a patent-infringment suit brought by Eastman Kodak Co., said a recent action by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may prompt Sony to ask for a postponement of the suit.
Kodak sued Sony Corp. and its Sony Corp. of America unit last March for allegedly infringing on Kodak's 1981 U.S. patent covering magnetic recording technology used in items such as camcorders and videocassette recorders.
Sony has said that the Kodak patent is invalid "based on technology which was in the public domain" before Kodak filed its patent.
But last week, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a first action, rejecting Kodak's patent claims and casting a potentially harmful blow to Kodak's suit against Sony.
The action came after Sony introduced new evidence to the office and asked for a re-examination of the patent in June of last year.
Kodak said yesterday that it would respond to the action within the alloted 60-day period, but would not comment further on its plans, or on the impending lawsuit, scheduled for trial June 14.
The Rochester, N.Y.-based photography and health concern can either take exception to last week's action or amend the patent.
If Kodak takes exception and the action is still upheld, Kodak can then turn to the office's board of appeals.
Sony said it was "pleased," with the initial action and said it would consider using the decision to request a motion for postponement of the litigation.
Sony filed a similar motion late last year, but it was dismissed.
However, Sony could ask the court to revisit the motion, or it could file a new one, based on this most recent action by the patent and trademark office.
