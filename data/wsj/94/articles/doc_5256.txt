McGraw-Hill Inc. said it will reduce costs by consolidating its domestic book distribution operations.
The New York-based publishing and information company said the move, which will eliminate a total of 175 positions, will save the company an annual $10 million.
McGraw-Hill said the recent acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. created an opportunity to consolidate operations and cut costs.
Distribution operations in Hightstown, N.J., and Blue Ridge Summit, Pa., will be centralized in Columbus, Ohio, while financial and accounting operations in Columbus and credit operations in Blue Ridge Summit will be centralized in Hightstown.
