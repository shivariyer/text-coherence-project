California Federal Bank said it will sell $800 million of assets, including bad loans and foreclosed real estate, resulting in a $280 million loan-loss provision for the first quarter.
The provision will result in a first-quarter loss.
Results will be announced in late April.
In the year-ago quarter, the troubled thrift earned $10.5 million, or 40 cents a share.
CalFed is dumping the assets in an attempt to raise capital, so it can pursue its "hold and fix" strategy, instead of selling itself to bidder Golden West Financial Corp., Oakland, Calif.
Last month, CalFed's board rejected a $630 million bid from Golden West, saying CalFed is not for sale.
If the planned asset sales are successful, CalFed estimates that nonperforming assets would decline to less than 2% of total assets as of Dec. 31, 1993, from 5.26% currently.
At less than 2%, CalFed's nonperforming assets ratio would rival Golden West's 1.5% ratio, the best in the industry.
The bank will maintain its capital requirements by raising $300 million through a preferred stock and rights offering, which was announced yesterday.
Herb Sandler, Golden West's chief executive officer, declined to comment on how CalFed's write-down would affect his interest in the company.
