Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. plans to sell its 51% stake in a Japanese joint venture with Sequent Computer Systems Inc. back to the U.S. maker of minicomputers by the end of May, a spokesman for the Japanese consumer electronics concern said.
The spokesman declined to disclose the value of the transaction.
The venture at issue is Pana-Sequent Inc., which the two companies set up in 1989 to sell Sequent's computers in Japan.
The spokesman said the reason for Matsushita's pulling out of the venture is Sequent's desire to market its own products in Japan directly.
