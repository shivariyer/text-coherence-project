Dell Computer Corp., vowing to make advanced personal-computer networks easier to use, introduced 15 PC "servers," or computers designed to manage networks.
The machines, priced from $4,598, are made to serve from 25 to 500 PCs and include diagnostic software aimed at pinpointing problems before they affect the network.
The products come amid a boom in the server market as more companies replace mainframe computers with networks of PCs.
Dell's effort to simplify its systems includes installing certain software and networking hardware at the factory and including sensors that can warn users of, say, overheating parts or defective fans.
Dell, based in Austin, Texas, and a leading mail-order merchant of PCs, has struggled in its recent server efforts, in part because of a limited distribution network outside its mail-order stronghold.
Susan Frankle, manager of server research at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass., said the servers are an improvement over Dell's existing line, but criticized the company's continuing lack of corporate sales expertise as well as some technical shortcomings that might make the systems less attractive to the largest corporate networks.
In response, Tom Martin, Dell's vice president of world-wide marketing, noted that Dell has quietly expanded its network of computer dealers and resellers.
"We've changed our focus pretty dramatically in the last year," he said.
