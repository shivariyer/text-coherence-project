Japan, the world's top automobile producer since 1980, this year is likely to place second behind the U.S., the trade group said.
While Japan's production fell to 11,227,545 vehicles in 1993, U.S. output rose 12% from the previous year to 10,867,658.
Last year also marked the first time since World War II that Japan's auto production fell three consecutive years.
It slipped 1.8% in 1991 and 5.6% in 1992.
Japan's domestic vehicle sales fell 7.1% from a year earlier to 6,467,278 in 1993.
Exports fell about 11% to 5.02 million vehicles.
