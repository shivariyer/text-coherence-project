Fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg, 47 years old, was named to the newly created role of creative planning director for Q2, a lifestyles oriented home-shopping channel owned by this retail merchandising concern.
Ms. Von Furstenberg, a longtime friend of QVC Chairman Barry Diller, will "concentrate on special projects with a number of high-profile designers" for the channel, which is scheduled to begin operations this spring, QVC said.
