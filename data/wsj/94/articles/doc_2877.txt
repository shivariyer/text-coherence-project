U.K. pharmaceutical group Fisons PLC barely made a profit in 1993 as severe problems in its pharmaceutical division and a loss in its scientific-instruments division hurt results.
Pretax profit was #1 million ($1.49 million), down from #123.6 million a year earlier.
Sales increased 3.1% to #1.32 billion from #1.28 billion.
On a per-share basis, Fisons had a loss of 33.3 pence (4.917 cents), compared with profit of 13.9 pence a year earlier.
As it warned in December, Fisons cut its final dividend to one pence from 5.4 pence in 1992.
The dividend for the year was 4.3 pence, compared with 8.7 pence in 1992.
Fisons said the pretax profit followed a #2.1 million gain from asset disposal and a #32.9 million loss from discontinuation of businesses.
Fisons had write-offs and disposals at Fisons Instruments and took a #13.1 million write-off of goodwill from the expected disposal of its European horticulture business.
