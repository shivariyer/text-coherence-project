Xerox Corp. posted a fourth-quarter loss of $577 million after taking a big restructuring charge, but operating earnings rose mildly despite a slight decline in revenue.
Xerox had recently announced it would take an after-tax charge of $700 million to cut 10,000 jobs and close some sites.
Yesterday the company said the restructuring would result in pretax savings of $350 million this year and $700 million in 1995.
In the fourth quarter, Xerox's net loss of $577 million, or $5.63 a share, compared with a wider loss of $736 million, or $7.80 a share, a year earlier.
Year-ago results reflected a net loss of $752 million on insurance operations, including after-tax charges of $688 million to restructure and exit most of the insurance business.
Revenue in the most recent quarter fell 1.1% to $4.18 billion from $4.23 billion, while operating profit, before extraordinary items, rose almost 9.3% to $236 million from $216 million.
Xerox said fourth-quarter revenue rose 5%, excluding the effects of foreign currency translation.
Wall Street appeared to take kindly to Xerox's profit outlook, as Xerox shares rose almost 6% to close at $98.125, up $5.50, in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Trading volume was heavy at almost 1.3 million shares.
That favorable response is in part because of the company's aggressive plans to continue cutting the work force and expenses even as its operating results post respectable growth.
The company said it reduced the world-wide work force in its major business lines by 2,300 in 1993, including 500 in the fourth quarter.
Wall Street also apparently applauds Xerox's continuing moves to get out of the financial services business into which the company had staged a costly diversification through much of the previous decade.
For the year, Xerox posted a net loss of $126 million, or $1.84 a share, because of restructuring and other one-time charges, compared with a 1992 loss of $1.02 billion, or $11.29 a share, on charges and losses related to Xerox's financial-services businesses.
Revenue in 1993 dropped slightly to $14.6 billion from $14.68 billion, but full-year operating profit rose to $620 million from $562 million in 1992.
