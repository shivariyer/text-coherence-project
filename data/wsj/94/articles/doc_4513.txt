Iwerks Entertainment Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Omni Films International Inc., a Sarasota, Fla., simulation-theater company, for about $34 million in cash and stock.
The plan will combine two rivals in the burgeoning business of designing hightech entertainment rides for theme parks, shopping malls and other venues.
Under the agreement, Omni stockholders will receive $1.42 and 0.3744 shares of new Iwerks common stock for each Omni share held, or a total of about $4.5 million in cash and 1.2 million new Iwerks common shares.
Iwerks is based in Burbank, Calif.
After the completion of the sale, scheduled for May, Omni shareholders will hold an 11% stake in Iwerks.
Holders of about 37% of Omni's shares outstanding have granted Iwerks a proxy to vote their shares in favor of the transaction.
Iwerks stock closed unchanged at $24.25 a share in Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday.
