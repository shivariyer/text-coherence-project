Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said the government would resume foreclosing on farm loans with the start of a program to root out what his department termed shortcomings of the lending program.
"We want to analyze why loans are in trouble, eliminate procedural errors and implement a tracking system for new loans," said Michael Dunn, head of the Agriculture Department's Farmers Home Administration.
Secretary Espy suspended foreclosures of unpaid loans last March and began a review of loan practices.
The focus now, according to Mr. Dunn, is to "collect as much as we can" from outstanding loans.
He added the department expects to have "those delinquent loans not on appeal or under litigation" made current within two years.
The Farmers Home Administration has come under fire for failing to seek repayment from farmers and ranchers, especially wealthy ones, who have outstanding federal loans.
Recent legislation banned the agency from making loans of more than $500,000.
