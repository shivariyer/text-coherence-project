Vie de France Corp. said it will sell the assets of its restaurant division to Yamazaki Baking Co. of Tokyo for $20 million.
The division operates 31 restaurants in the U.S., employs 800 and reported sales of $28.6 million for its fiscal year ended in June 1993.
Yamazaki, a top baking company with about $4.9 billion in sales and 17,000 employees, purchased Vie de France's wholesale bakery division in 1991.
Stanislas Vilgrain, Vie de France's chief executive officer, said the sale would strengthen the company's financial position and help it develop its fast-growing culinary division, which provides products to the food-service industry.
The culinary division will be the company's principal remaining operation.
The sale is subject to certain conditions, including approval by the companies' boards and Vie de France shareholders, the execution of a definitive purchase and sale agreement and receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Vie de France closed at $5.25, up 6.25 cents.
