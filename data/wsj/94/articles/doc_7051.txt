Mylan Laboratories Inc., Pittsburgh, said it received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market Alprazolam tablets, a generic version of Upjohn Co.'s Xanax, used to treat anxiety.
Ronald Nordmann, analyst at PaineWebber Inc., noted that the FDA had already approved about 10 other generic versions of Xanax, and market prices for the drugs, which are minor tranquilizers, are "collapsing."
In October, Mylan became the first generic-drug company to win FDA approval to make and market cimetidine, the generic equivalent of SmithKline Beecham PLC's Tagamet ulcer drug.
But Mylan didn't have the advantage of being the first to market the generic version of Xanax, Mr. Nordmann said.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Mylan shares rose 50 cents to $24.25.
