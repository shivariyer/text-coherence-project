IRG Technologies Inc., which has posted disappointing earnings since it went public last May, disclosed that its auditors resigned and that the company had failed to win an extension of its bank line of credit.
In a news release, the Carrollton, Texas, computer-products distributor didn't say why Ernst & Young resigned as the company's auditor.
Neither IRG nor Ernst officials could be reached for comment.
IRG's stock, which sold for $7.50 a share in its initial public offering, sank 12.5% yesterday in composite trading on the Nasdaq stock market, closing at 87.5 cents, off 12.5 cents.
In the fourth quarter, the company had a loss of $554,000, or seven cents a share, on sales of $46.9 million.
The company said the line of credit expired March 1 without being renewed because of disagreement over terms of an extension.
But IRG said the lenders have continued to provide funding in the meantime, and have expressed a willingness to amend and extend the credit line through June 1.
