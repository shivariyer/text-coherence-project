The U.S. Justice Department said New Jersey will pay more than $7 million to settle a six-year-old suit alleging the state discriminated against blacks and women in its hiring practices for entry-level enforcement and corrections posts.
The settlement is the second largest obtained by the Justice Department in an employment-discrimination case against a state or local government, the department said.
The suit charged that New Jersey administered state-developed written tests that "disproportionately excluded minorities" and that "were not predictive of successful job performance."
The Justice Department also alleged that the state unfairly excluded women from some police jobs by giving a physical-agility test that was not related to success on the job.
The suit also alleged that the state created "male only" lists for some correction-officer positions.
Under the settlement, the state will distribute $6.5 million in back pay to black and female applicants affected by the alleged discriminatory practices and provide priority offers of employment to about 450 people.
New Jersey also agreed to use only tests and other selection devices that comply with federal law and are demonstrably relevant to job performance, the Justice Department said.
The state also changed its gender-restricted assignment policies for correction-officer jobs.
Money also will go toward retroactive pension benefits to certain affected individuals.
A spokesman for the governor couldn't be reached for comment.
