Aileen Inc., New York, said it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors.
Aileen said it decided to seek relief after failing to reach an agreement to extend a credit line with its existing lender.
The women's apparel manufacturer said efforts to secure financing from other lenders were scuttled in part by a downturn in fall and winter sales.
The company operates 144 manufacturers' outlet retail stores in 40 states.
The bankruptcy petition, which also includes a subsidiary, Aileen Stores Inc., was filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
Aileen said Sterling National Bank & Trust Co., New York, agreed to provide $4.5 million of debtor-in-possession financing.
For fiscal 1993, ended Oct. 30, assets totaled about $39 million and liabilities $15 million, Aileen said.
It reported a full-year net loss of $4,751,000, or 89 cents a share, against net income of $1,014,000, or 19 cents a share, the previous year.
