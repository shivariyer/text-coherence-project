USF&G Corp. said its USF&G Insurance unit estimated losses related to winter storms and the California earthquake at about $35 million on about 11,400 claims.
The insurance concern said first-quarter results would reflect the losses.
In the 1993 first quarter, the company said it had about $30 million in losses from winter storms; in that period, the company had net income of $61 million, or 58 cents a share, on revenue of $875 million.
