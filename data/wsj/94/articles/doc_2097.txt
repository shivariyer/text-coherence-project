The Securities and Exchange Commission said Consolidated Edison Co. of New York must allow shareholders to vote on a resolution questioning the utility's relationship with Hydro-Quebec, the large Canadian power company.
Con Edison had argued the resolution shouldn't be included in the proxy statement for vote by shareholders at this year's annual meeting because the Hydro-Quebec agreement is a "regular part of doing business."
The resolution, proposed by the Adrian Dominican Sisters of Adrian, Mich., says the religious group is concerned about Hydro-Quebec's involvement in large controversial projects, which have sparked protests by environmental groups and Indian tribes.
The resolution, if adopted at the May meeting, would require Con Edison to, among other things, prepare a report on its contract with Hydro-Quebec and why a contract would benefit Con Edison, its customers and its shareholders.
Con Edison said it hadn't reached a decision on whether it would support or oppose adoption of the resolution, which resolution comes at a crucial time for the power concerns.
Last month, the New York Power Authority canceled a proposed 20year agreement with Hydro-Quebec in which Con Edison would have been the primary customer.
Since then, Hydro-Quebec and Con Edison negotiated and reached an agreement in principle that would go into effect in 1999.
Under terms of that pact, Con Edison would purchase power in the summer from Hydro-Quebec's surplus supply and Hydro-Quebec would purchase power from Con Edison in the winter.
Hydro-Quebec said its hydroelectric projects are undergoing an exhaustive environmental review.
It also pointed out its power contracts aren't related to specific projects.
