Greek Industry Minister Costas Simitis said test drillings north of the Prinos deposit, which started two months ago, were successful and confirmed the discovery of a new oil deposit.
Individuals at the Industry Ministry said that the newly discovered deposit could supply up to 20% of Greece's oil needs.
But the government is trying to keep a low profile on the find, fearing tension with Turkey, which disputes exploration rights in the region.
Mr. Simitis said that the newly discovered oil is of lesser quality than that found in the Prinos field, which produces an average of 16,000 barrels a day, about 7% of Greece's annual requirement.
Prinos, at the south of Thasos island in the northeastern Aegean, so far is Greece's only exploited oil field; it was discovered in 1974.
The field is operated by the North Aegean Petroleum Co., a consortium made of four foreign companies and Greece's state-owned Public Oil Corp. -- Hydrocoarbon Research & Exploitation; the consortium is led by Denison Mines Ltd. of Canada.
Greece's oil exploration rights in the Aegean Sea are disputed by Turkey.
Athens says that it has the right to extend its territorial waters to 19 kilometers from the current 10 kilometers, something that Ankara strongly objects to.
Turkey also argues that Greek islands in the Aegean have no right to have their own continental shelf.
The two rivals came near war in March 1987, when Turkey threatened to search for oil around three Greek islands off its coast, following an announcement by Greece that it planned to drill east of Thasos island and beyond the 10-kilometer limit.
Prinos is within that limit.
