Pummeled by cigarette price wars and fluctuating foreign currencies, American Brands Inc. said that fourth-quarter net income fell 20%.
American Brands, based in Old Greenwich, Conn., reported fourth-quarter net income of $187.4 million, or 92 cents a share, including a $2.6 million, noncash accounting adjustment.
The company, which has core businesses in tobacco, distilled spirits, life insurance, hardware and other products, had fourth-quarter profit of $233.3 million, or $1.15 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue for the quarter edged up 1.2% to $3.82 billion from $3.77 billion a year earlier.
The company said fourth-quarter revenue would have risen about 5% without the impact of fluctuating currencies overseas.
For the year, American Brands reported that net income fell 47% to $469.8 million, or $2.32 a share, from $883.8 million, or $4.29 a share, a year earlier.
