Scott Paper Co., hurt by world-wide overcapacity in the paper industry, took a fourth-quarter charge of $381 million for a sweeping restructuring that will include cutting 8,300 jobs, or 25% of its work force, and closing some plants.
Analysts estimated that the company will save $300 million annually when the job cuts are completed in three years and as much as an additional $300 million annually from the plant closings and consolidations, which the company said will include idling some tissue-paper and coated-paper machines and making "efficiency improvements" at its paper and pulp plants.
The moves, which were more aggressive than analysts expected, represent the last major action to be taken by Philip E. Lippincott, chairman and chief executive officer, who has announced plans to retire in early April.
"We can no longer count on improving prices, increasing volume or inflation," Mr. Lippincott said.
"So we need to assume that none of that will help us and concentrate solely on becoming the lowest-cost producer possible."
The news sent the shares of Scott up $2.125, or 4.9%, to close at a 52-week high of $45.50 in extremely heavy composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
But some analysts suggested that the restructuring charge, the third that Scott has taken in the last four years and by far the largest, signals that the company may need to do more.
"They announced a much stronger, more aggressive plan than anyone thought they would," said Mark S. Rogers, an analyst with Prudential Securities Inc.
"And the market's reaction is a typical reaction to projected savings.
But I would advise some caution, because the size of the charge may reflect some underlying problems that won't be so easy to solve."
Largely as a result of the charge, which amounted to $5.15 a share, the company, which is based in Philadelphia, reported a net loss of $370.3 million, or $5.01 a share, for the fourth quarter.
The loss also included other nonrecurring charges of $14.1 million, or 19 cents a share, and a $9.6 million charge, or 13 cents a share, for early retirement of debt.
A year earlier, net income was $44.8 million, or 61 cents a share.
Revenue declined 5.8% to $1.20 billion from $1.28 billion.
The depth of the job cuts and plant closings reflect the world-wide paper-industry overcapacity problems, which have led to intense price competition and depressed earnings.
Scott said it plans to slash 8,300 jobs in the next three years, reducing its work force to 24,700.
The cuts include 3,800 in the U.S., 1,900 in Mexico and 2,600 overseas.
The U.S. cuts will include 300 at corporate offices.
The company wouldn't specify how many plants would be closed, saying only that "some" would be shut.
It also plans "efficiency improvements" at its paper and pulp plants, which likely will include partial reductions in plant capacities.
And at its S.D. Warren printing-papers unit, the company plans to idle two of four machines at its Westbrook, Maine, plant.
The company will also convert a Spanish mill from virgin to recycled pulp.
Mr. Lippincott said the announcement reflects an internal review process that began last May.
The company said it will put off further strategic decisions until a new chief executive is named.
"Scott said they will shut down as many plants as they need to in order to simplify their operations and cut costs," said Matthew Berler, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
"Market share and volume gains are no longer their focus, but instead it has become production costs and efficiency.
They are beginning to play the game differently than the rest of the paper industry."
Part of Scott's change in strategy stems from the extreme pricing pressure at its core personal-care and cleaning-products group.
For 1993, sales declined to $3.58 billion from $3.86 billion in 1992.
In the U.S., market-share battles continue to erode margins.
Scott continues to perform strongly with its Baby Fresh baby wipes, but other businesses such as facial tissue and toilet paper haven't been as strong.
Among its branded products, Scott sells Viva paper towels, Cotonelle toilet paper and Scotties facial tissue.
In paper products, "price warfare and intense competitive conditions dominate the market," said Bruce Kirk, an analyst with S.G. Warburg & Co.
At S.D. Warren, the company's printing-paper business, sales declined to $1.16 billion in 1993 from $1.24 billion in 1992 as overcapacity problems continued to push prices down.
Operating profit declined to $79.6 million in 1993 from $90.8 million in 1992.
For its 1993 reporting year, ended Dec. 25, Scott reported a net loss of $277 million, or $3.75 a share, compared with net income of $167.2 million, or $2.26 a share, in 1992.
Revenue declined 6.7% to $4.75 billion in fiscal 1993 from $5.09 billion in 1992.
The 1993 earnings include a $21.7 million, or 29 cents a share, gain from changes in accounting for income taxes.
