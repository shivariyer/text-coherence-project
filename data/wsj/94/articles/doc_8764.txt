The California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest pension plan for state employees, is gearing up for proxy fights with three big companies this spring.
In a report to be released today, Calpers said it filed shareholder proposals to appear on proxy statements at annual meetings at Boise Cascade Corp., U.S. Shoe Corp. and Zenith Electronics Corp.
The proposals aim to give outside directors more clout, make management more responsive to shareholders and improve the companies' operating results.
Meanwhile, the fund says it is postponing decisions about similar proposals at CPI Corp., a photographic holding company, and First Mississippi Corp., a chemical concern.
At paper company Boise Cascade, spokesman Robert Hayes says that Calpers's complaints about the company's financial performance are "way off the mark."
A spokesman for U.S. Shoe, which has interests in specialty retailing, said talks would continue with Calpers before the company's annual meeting in May, while a Zenith spokesman said company officials are still in discussions with Calpers and believe the fund will withdraw its proposal before the company's April annual meeting.
