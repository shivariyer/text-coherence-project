The Internal Revenue Service awarded a $1.3 billion document-processing system contract to the Federal Systems Co. unit of International Business Machines Corp.
Loral Corp. agreed in December to purchase Federal Systems from IBM for $1.6 billion in cash.
The sale is expected to close this quarter.
The unit had about $2 billion in revenue in 1994.
The IRS said the contract will cover technology that will turn taxpayer-filed tax forms into electronic images, starting in 1996.
The contract is for 15 years and covers hardware, software, testing, training, implementation and maintenance.
