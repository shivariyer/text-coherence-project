Unisys Corp. said the U.S. Postal Service will begin field-testing of Unisys's self-service postage and mailing center tomorrow at a post office in Merrifield, Va.
The company said the mailing center provides 24-hour service without involving a retail clerk.
The company said the system weighs mail, accepts cash payments and issues stamps at varying rates.
The company said the postal service will bring the mailing centers to five more northern Virginia locations on Monday.
