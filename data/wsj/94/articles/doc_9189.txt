Retail sales continued to rise in December, and sales for all of 1993 showed the strongest annual increase in four years, the Commerce Department said.
Spurred by a jump in demand for building materials and appliances, sales last month climbed 0.8%, after rising 0.3% the month before.
Sales for all 1993 rose 6.2%.
Sales of durable goods rose 1.7% last month as consumers took advantage of low interest rates to improve or furnish their homes.
Sales of building materials rose 2.7%, and furniture sales increased 1.8%.
Auto sales were up 1.2% from November.
"The consumer's wallet is still open," said Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, adding that, "despite concerns about a slowing in December, we didn't get it."
He predicted continued strong sales of building supplies and appliances as the economy feels the effects of the housingstarts increase of several months ago.
But he said retail sales could suffer in this year's first quarter because of bad weather or other reasons.
"People this Christmas were more interested in the hard goods," said Ron Piencykoski, chief of the Commerce Department's retail-sales and inventories branch.
Consumers' spending on big-ticket items came at the expense of spending on other goods.
Retail sales of nondurable goods increased only 0.3% from November's figure, reflecting sharp declines in retail sales of clothing, which fell 0.9%, and general merchandise, which was down 0.3%.
"You don't buy apparel in the same month you buy a new car," said Mr. Dederick.
"There's a limit on what people can spend, so you see a crowding out of soft goods."
Separately, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 1,000 in the week ended Saturday, to 354,000 from a revised 355,000 the previous week.
The four-week moving average of new claims -- considered a better gauge of the labor market than the weekly figures -- rose 6,500 last week, to 333,000.
All figures are adjusted for seasonal variation.
Before seasonal adjustment, retail sales totaled $218.26 billion last month, up from $181.13 billion in November.
Sales for all of 1993 totaled $2.084 trillion, up from $1.955 trillion in 1992, when sales rose 4.8%.
