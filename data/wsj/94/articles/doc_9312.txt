Driven by tremendous growth in its underwriting business, Bear Stearns Cos.' fiscal second-quarter earnings more than doubled.
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the parent of brokerage firm Bear, Stearns & Co. reported net income of $134.8 million, or $1.05 a share, up from $64.3 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 58% to $1 billion from $632.6 million.
Bear Stearns's second-quarter performance outstripped the average analyst's estimate of about 78 cents a share, indicating that the three-year-old brokerage industry earnings binge isn't over yet.
Bear Stearns bolstered that point by showing strong gains against its most recent quarter.
In the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, the company had net income of $104.3 million, or 81 cents a share, on revenue of $771.7 million.
Bear Stearns's strongest second-quarter gains came in investment banking, where revenue surged by 180%.
Analysts said more than 80% of the investment banking revenue stemmed from a flurry of debt and equity offerings.
"Their underwriting performance was strong, but, more importantly, they are also gaining market share in that area," said Joan S. Solotar, a Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette analyst.
Bear Stearns reported revenue gains from most business areas in the latest quarter, with revenue from trading activity rising 58% from a year earlier.
The company also hired about 250 new employees in the latest quarter, primarily for new offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.
Bear Stearns has about 6,800 employees.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading, Bear Stearns was quoted at $23.875, up 75 cents.
