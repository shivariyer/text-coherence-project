Rubbermaid Inc. said it expects first-quarter sales and earnings growth to be in the "low single-digit range," citing sluggish sales due to the harsh weather in January and February.
Additionally, Rubbermaid said the continuing consolidation within the retail and office products distributions channels constrained short-term sales due to inventory liquidation and customer restructuring efforts.
The Wooster, Ohio, company said it expected more favorable sales and earnings in the second quarter.
Rubbermaid told analysts that first-quarter earnings would be about 32 cents a share.
In the 1993 first quarter, Rubbermaid had earnings of $49.6 million, or 31 cents a share, on sales of $483.7 million.
In the 1993 second quarter, it posted earnings of $50.6 million, or 32 cents a share, on sales of $488.5 million.
Rubbermaid makes plastic and rubber products, including kitchenware, laundry and bath accessories, microwave ovenware, office products and children's toys.
