MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. said it will invest 200 million Canadian dollars (US$149 million) in a new lightweight coated paper machine at its mill in Port Alberni, British Columbia.
The Vancouver, British Columbia-based forest-products company said the investment is part of a strategy to reduce its dependence on the sale of such commodities as newsprint.
The Port Alberni mill now makes newsprint and directory paper; lightweight coated paper is used in magazines.
The new machine, to begin operating by late 1995, will produce 176 tons a year.
Robert Findlay, president and chief executive, said the investment decision was made despite concern about wood-fiber supplies.
A British Columbia commission this week recommended reducing logging on Vancouver Island, where Port Alberni is situated.
