P.H. Glatfelter Co., a maker of printing, tobacco, and specialty papers, said it would eliminate 100 jobs at its Ecusta division to improve profitability.
The layoffs, which follow 180 last year, represent 7% of the division's total work force.
They will be made at the company's Pisgah Forest, N.C., plant, effective March 31, Glatfelter said.
