American Financial Corp. announced plans to refinance its $548.7 million debt in order to reduce its interest expense and extend the time required to repay its debt.
Under terms of the plan, the company said it would exchange new 9.5% debentures due April 20, 2004, for all of its debentures outstanding.
The closely held company, which has interests in property and casualty insurance, annuity programs and portfolio investing, said the exchange offer expires March 25 at 5 p.m. EST.
Following the offer, the company said, it will redeem as many debentures as its resources allow.
The new debentures will retain the same principal amount, and holders will receive a 2% cash premium for each $1,000 in debentures exchanged.
The following debentures qualify for the exchange offer: 9.5% subordinated debentures due April 22, 1999; 10% debentures due Oct. 20, 1999; 10% debentures due Oct. 20, 1999, Series A; 12% debentures due Sept. 3, 1999; 12% debentures due Sept. 3, 1999, Series A and Series B; 12.25% debentures due Sept. 15, 2003; 13.5% debentures due Sept. 14, 2004; and 13.5% debentures due Sept. 15, 2004, Series A.
The 12.25% debentures due 2003 are redeemable at 103.75% of principal amount.
All other issues of old debentures are redeemable at principal amount.
All regular semiannual interest payments due in March and April 1994 will be paid on the old issues of debentures currently outstanding, including those tendered and accepted for exchange.
