The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Food and Drug Administration are investigating a PepsiCo Inc. bottler here following the hospitalization of a four-year-old boy after he drank some 7Up.
George Lambert, an FBI supervisory special agent in Knoxville, said the investigation began last week after a boy in Sweetwater, Tenn., "vomited and became ill" after drinking 7Up from a two-liter bottle.
No similar incidents have been reported.
Pepsi, which bottles 7Up in Knoxville, called the FDA to ask it to look into the incident Feb. 22, a spokeswoman said.
The company, based in Purchase, N.Y., suspects something was "put into the container after it was shipped" from the bottling plant, she said.
Investigators haven't determined what caused the illness.
The child has been hospitalized for one week.
His family declined to comment.
