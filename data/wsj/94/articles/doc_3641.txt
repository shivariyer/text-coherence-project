The International Brotherhood of Teamsters filed a counterclaim against United Parcel Service of America Inc., charging that the company is responsible for damages from a recent strike.
The exact dollar amount hasn't been determined, but the Teamsters said it will ask for "millions of dollars" in damages from the package-delivery company for imposing a new package-weight limit that forced a recent strike.
UPS, based in Atlanta, raised its package limit to 150 pounds from 70 pounds on Feb. 7, sparking a one-day strike by the Teamsters, who said the new weights were dangerous to its workers.
Shortly after the strike, UPS sued the Teamsters for $50 million in damages, saying the union defied a court order and that the strike was illegal.
In its response to the suit, filed in U.S. District Court here yesterday, the Teamsters said the case is without merit and added that UPS is liable for damages for members' lost wages and other compensation related to the strike.
UPS said the Teamsters' claim is an attempt to "draw attention from the legitimate suit" against the union.
