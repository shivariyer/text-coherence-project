Thermo Fibertek Inc., citing higher customer spending, said it expects to report a 34% increase in fourth-quarter net income on a 24% increase in revenue.
William A. Rainville, president and chief executive, said Thermo Fibertek expects net income of $2.4 million, or nine cents a share, compared with a year-earlier $1.8 million, or seven cents a share.
Revenue is expected to be $40.8 million, up from a year-earlier $32.9 million.
Thermo Fibertek is a maker of equipment used in manufacturing both recycled and nonrecycled paper.
It is a publicly traded unit of Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, Mass.
Mr. Rainville said the quarterly results were boosted by increased spending by U.S. customers.
"With the end of the recession, we're seeing a turnaround in North America," he said.
