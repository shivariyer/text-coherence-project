United Parcel Service of America Inc. reported a 36% increase in 1993 earnings despite heavy losses overseas.
The Atlanta-based delivery company said net income rose to $809.6 million from $516.1 million in 1992.
Excluding one-time accounting changes, 1992 earnings totaled $765 million.
Revenue climbed 8% to $17.8 billion from $16.5 billion.
The company had an overseas loss of $267 million, slightly lower than its overseas loss of $276 million in 1992.
International revenue rose to $1.96 billion from $1.79 billion, boosted by air business.
But analysts were expecting a more robust improvement, and said the company's goal of becoming profitable overseas by 1996 appeared unlikely.
But UPS said it still stands by its goal.
So far, UPS has posted losses of more than $1 billion overseas, mostly in Europe.
Fierce competition, higher costs and slow demand have dogged its attempts to become profitable.
Most recently, the deep recession in Europe has hurt performance.
Still, UPS said it has no plans to curtail its overseas operations.
