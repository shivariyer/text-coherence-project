Japanese nonferrous metals concern Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. lowered its forecasts for both consolidated and unconsolidated earnings and canceled its plans for paying dividends in the fiscal year ending March 31.
The company also outlined new restructuring measures, including pulling out of the lead refining business, cutting salaries and slimming its work force 11% through an early retirement program.
On a consolidated basis, Mitsui Mining & Smelting said it now expects its pretax loss to widen to 4.60 billion yen ($41.8 million) from 2.46 billion yen a year earlier.
At the start of the fiscal year, the company had forecast a return to consolidated profitability.
Mitsui Mining & Smelting said its restructuring plan will bring about a return to profitability and eventually will increase profits even in times of slow growth.
The company said it foresees continued economic weakness in the coming fiscal year weighing on revenue.
The company said it will stop smelting lead at its Kamioka plant, and shift activities there to recycling spent battery materials.
Mitsui Mining & Smelting said it will consign some smelting activities to other companies.
Mitsui Mining & Smelting also said it will stop operations of its Miike rare metals and rare earth facilities, and instead begin importing the materials.
The company said it would also strengthen its electronic materials operations, increasing output to meet the growing demand for materials used in liquid crystal displays and shifting production overseas as its customers do so as well.
The company also said it would reduce staffing of its parent company and five subsidiaries by 500 workers, or 11%, to 4,360 workers through an early retirement program.
It said the reduction would be completed by the end of June 1996.
The company said it also plans to cut wages over the next two years, but didn't provide details.
