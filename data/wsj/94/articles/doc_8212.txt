Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s fourth-quarter net loss narrowed to $478 million from $1.28 billion a year earlier, although many of its units posted weak results.
On a per-share basis, the power generation, broadcasting and defense electronics concern had a loss of $1.38, compared with a year-earlier loss of $3.74.
Revenue climbed 3% to $2.64 billion from $2.56 billion.
The latest quarter included previously announced charges of about $644 million.
They included $493 million for layoffs, divestitures, legal settlements and an environmental cleanup and $95 million for discontinued operations.
The charges also included $56 million for a change in how the company accounts for post-employment benefits.
The year-earlier period included a charge of $1.36 billion, or $3.92 a share, for discontinued operations.
Excluding the charges, Westinghouse's continuing operations earned $110 million in the quarter, up from $79 million a year ago.
Michael H. Jordan, chairman and chief executive, called the results "disappointing," but said, "we took a number of actions in the fourth quarter to improve our operating performance, accelerate divestiture of noncore businesses and improve our financial flexibility."
Westinghouse also warned that first-quarter earnings "will be down substantially" from year-earlier net of $59 million, or 14 cents a share.
The company blamed higher pension expense, lower income from licensing power generation technology overseas and a one-time change in the way it accounts for nuclear fuel revenue.
Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with NatWest Securities Corp., estimated the items will cost about $70 million on a pretax basis.
He figured the company will earn five cents to six cents a share in the first quarter.
Westinghouse closed at $13.625, down 25 cents, in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
For all of 1993, Westinghouse posted a net loss of $326 million, or $1.07 a share, compared with a 1992 net loss of $1.39 billion, or $4.11 a share.
The 1992 results included an accounting charge of $338 million and the charge for discontinued operations.
Excluding charges, Westinghouse said its 1993 earnings from continuing operations were $318 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with $357 million, or 95 cents a share, in 1992.
Revenue fell 4% to $8.88 billion from $9.25 billion.
Westinghouse's defense electronics unit had substantially higher operating profit in the quarter as shipments climbed.
Power generation's operating profit rose slightly.
And the Knoll Group furniture unit cut its operating loss "substantially" as North American sales rose.
But Westinghouse's broadcasting unit posted flat operating profit as strong results in its radio and satellite communications businesses were offset by poor results in television.
The environmental cleanup business saw operating profit fall "substantially" on lower volumes, falling prices at its waste incineration business and cost overruns at a German unit.
