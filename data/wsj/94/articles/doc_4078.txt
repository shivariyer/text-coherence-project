Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc., aided by an expanded portfolio, expects to report a more than 50% increase in fourth-quarter earnings, to between 40 cents and 43 cents, from 27 cents in the year-earlier quarter, Steven B. Tanger, executive vice president, said.
The year-ago results are pro forma, as the company went public in June 1993.
The real estate investment trust which owns and operates 19 shopping centers in 16 states, expects to report revenue of approximately $8.8 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1993, a 50% increase from the year-earlier fourth-quarter revenue of $5.8 million.
Mr. Tanger said in an interview that funds from operations increased to between 58 cents and 60 cents a share in the fourth quarter, from 33 cents in the year-earlier quarter.
Funds from operations encompass net income before extraordinary items and gains from the sale of properties, and adjustments for noncash items, depreciation and amortization, Mr. Tanger said.
The growth, Mr. Tanger said, is attributable to the expansion of Tanger's existing portfolio.
During 1993, the company expanded its portfolio by 54% with the addition of 695,000 square feet, including four new shopping centers in Louisiana, Kansas, Oregon and Texas.
The company also expanded existing shopping centers in other states, including Alabama, Minnesota and Georgia, Mr. Tanger said.
"We have continued high demand for space in our shopping centers," Mr. Tanger said, adding that Tanger centers are now operating at 98% occupancy.
In 1994, Tanger plans to continue its expansion, and will add some 700,000 square feet of retail space, including at least four new shopping centers, to its portfolio.
Mr. Tanger said the company has no tenants in its portfolio with a larger than 10% contribution to the company's base rent.
Tanger's largest tenants include Liz Claiborne Inc. and Sara Lee Corp.
