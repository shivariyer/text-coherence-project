Tandem Computers Inc., Cupertino, Calif., said it will ship four new software products in the fourth quarter for its high-powered Himalaya computers.
The most significant product is a new version of Tandem's NonStop software, to be developed by Micro Focus Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.
The software will allow Himalaya computers to run International Business Machines Corp.'s popular Customer Information Control System software, which processes transactions such as credit card verifications.
Tandem hopes that corporate customers who like the IBM software will now consider buying Himalayas to run it.
Himalayas are "massively parallel" computers, which speed up calculations by stringing together powerful chips.
