Sun Microsystems Inc. agreed to pay Novell Inc. $82.5 million as a one-time license fee to use the Unix operating system, software that controls the basic operations of computers sold by Sun and other companies.
The deal replaces a previous arrangement under which Sun had paid Novell a royalty for each copy sold of Sun's Unix-based operating system, called Solaris.
It frees Sun from complex restrictions on its ability to modify Unix and cut special pricing deals with customers.
The restrictions date from a 1987 agreement between Sun and American Telephone & Telegraph Co., which invented the program but sold its Unix business to Novell last year.
"It was a mess," said Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive officer.
"We had to have people who were experts on that thing to know what we could do."
Significantly, the new arrangement allows Sun to grant its own Unix licenses to other hardware makers, which would not be required to pay anything to Novell.
In the past, the company had to ask such potential customers to seek an additional license from Novell, which competes with Sun by selling its own version of Unix.
David Card, an analyst at International Data Corp., believes Sun wants to supplant Novell as the primary standard bearer for Unix.
However, he doubts that many of Sun's major computer competitors will want to buy from Sun.
Novell, which also gave Sun a license to some of its Netware software technologies, is talking with other major computer makers about cutting similar Unix deals.
Raymond Noorda, its CEO, said such license agreements will help broaden the market for Unix against competitors.
