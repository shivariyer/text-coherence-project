Sony Corp. of America, a unit of Sony Corp., plans to build an optical disk manufacturing center in Springfield, Ore.
The 250,000-square-foot facility will manufacture a full line of optical disk products to serve the entertainment and information markets, Sony said.
The initial phase of the project will have a capacity of three million disks a month and will employ about 300 people.
The plant, which is scheduled to open in the second half of 1995, is Sony's fourth pre-recorded software media manufacturing facility in the U.S., the company said.
