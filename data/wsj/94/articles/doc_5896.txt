Productivity of American business surged at a 4.2% annual rate in last year's fourth quarter, as factories managed to make many more goods without adding very many workers.
For all of last year, the Labor Department said, the productivity of American business, excluding farms, rose by 1.6%.
That was more than in most recent years, but below the 3.1% improvement in 1992.
Productivity measures output per hour of work; improving productivity is the key to rising living standards.
The Labor Department said that manufacturing productivity increased at a 7.8% rate in the fourth quarter.
That was primarily because makers of durable, or long-lived, goods improved productivity at a huge 12.8% rate.
For the year, factory productivity rose by 5.3%, its best gain since 1987; output rose 4.9%, while hours worked actually fell by 0.3%.
Economists are still debating whether the recent improvements in productivity reflect the usual post-recession trend or whether something more fundamental is changing.
Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses, an important indicator of in flation trends, fell at a 1.2% rate in the fourth quarter; they were up 2.1% for the year, slightly higher than last year's 1.7% increase.
In manufacturing, unit labor costs fell 2.4% last year, the first such decline since 1987.
