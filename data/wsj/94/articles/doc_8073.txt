USA Waste Services Inc. said it agreed to acquire Houston-based Envirofil Inc. in exchange for stock valued at $139.5 million.
Both companies are in the solid-waste collection and disposal business.
The combined entity will retain USA Waste's name and generate annual revenue of about $175 million, USA Waste said.
Under the agreement, Envirofil shareholders will receive one share of USA Waste's common stock for every five shares of Envirofil's common stock outstanding.
The transaction, which is subject to shareholder approval, will increase USA Waste's stock outstanding to 20.8 million common shares from 11.5 million common shares.
Donald F. Moorehead Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of USA Waste, said the acquisition will position USA Waste for what the company expects to be a consolidation in the solid-waste industry.
After the merger, Mr. Moorehead, 43 years old, will continue in his posts.
Envirofil's president, David SutherlandYoest, 37, will be president and chief operating officer of the combined company.
USA Waste's chief financial officer, Earl E. DeFrates, 50, will continue in that position.
USA Waste shares closed at $15, up 50 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
Envirofil rose 12.5 cents to $3.125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
