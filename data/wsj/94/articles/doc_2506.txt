Cadbury Schweppes PLC, of London, said it is pursuing possible marketing and joint bottling agreements with Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Cos., in which it holds a 25.9% stake.
David Wellings, chief executive officer of Cadbury, the world's third-largest soft-drink concern, said the company also is interested in introducing Dr Pepper in markets outside the U.S. where Cadbury already has a strong presence.
Mr. Wellings said the two companies are discussing how they can work together to exploit synergies.
"Clearly, there's value in our working together," he said.
Mr. Wellings also said Cadbury continues to seek representation on Dr Pepper's board.
A spokesman for Dr Pepper, however, said in Dallas that the companies have no discussions currently under way, and that otherwise, "we aren't in a position to comment on what they're doing or saying."
