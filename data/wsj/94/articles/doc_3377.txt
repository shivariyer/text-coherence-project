Regarding the Feb. 8 Leisure & Arts piece on Henry Winkler, in which he answers a series of political and cultural questions both as himself and as his far-right TV persona Monty, I'll have to admit that he did an excellent, thorough and precise parody -- of a liberal.
Speaking as himself, he sounded off with all the familiar prejudices and timeworn cliches that liberals think are original.
One could almost hear the sanctimony and self-righteousness seething through his voice, making us wish for the return of Fonzie, if only to bury Henry Winkler under his layers of grease.
As for the acting part, in which he played a conservative, all I can say is that he needs to study his subject.
I know many people he would brand "far-right extremists," and they don't believe anything remotely resembling what he imputes to them.
Naturally, I recognize that he was attempting to be funny, but as anyone who has ever been bored by an after-midnight "Saturday Night Live" skit will attest, good humor always has its basis in reality.
I'm always amused to see an actor from the North or West playing a Southerner and giving himself or herself away by such tell-tale goofs as confusing "y'all" with the second-person singular.
In Mr. Winkler's case, anyone can recognize that the whole "Monty" act is simply a put-down of the dreaded Rush Limbaugh; perhaps, like others who imagine that Mr. Limbaugh is as intolerant as they are, he's never listened to the show.
