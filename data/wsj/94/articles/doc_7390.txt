As someone who has worked with children and teenagers, I must take exception to Dorothy Rabinowitz's review of the opening episode of "Homicide" ("Teens and Tories Who Kill," Leisure & Arts, Jan 10).
Anyone who has worked with teenagers, or more specifically urban youth, will attest to the importance they place on "saving face."
The last thing gang members or rebellious youth will take is any form of "dissing."
It is a pervasive attitude.
To back down after someone has "dissed" you, especially in front of your friends, is next to impossible.
These young people find it difficult to just walk away, even if they never had any intention to harm someone.
In short, while I will agree that the criminal in "Homicide" is not necessarily representative of most young criminals in urban areas, he is increasingly representative of the many young people who commit crimes they never thought they would or could.
