Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed earned $4.2 million in cash compensation last year, reflecting the company's 1993 performance "that was significantly better than planned," according to the company's 1994 proxy statement.
The nation's largest banking company earned $2.2 billion, or $4.11 a share, driven by sharply lower bad-debt costs and higher revenue from trading securities and currencies.
It is believed to be the highest cash compensation ever earned by a bank chief executive, but few other big banks have released their proxy statements for 1993.
Mr. Reed earned a $3 million bonus and salary and savings plan benefits of $1.2 million.
Last year his bonus was $1.035 million.
In addition, Mr. Reed received 50,000 restricted stock options that the company valued at over $2 million, and 450,000 of nonrestricted stock options.
Meanwhile, the company said two directors, Lawrence Fouraker and Donald Seibert, are retiring, bringing the number of directors up for re-election to sixteen.
The directors voted last month to fix the board's size at that level, the proxy says.
The directors wrote in the proxy that Mr. Reed's compensation stemmed from his "vision and tenacity in overseeing Citicorp's return to corporate strength, and determined that Mr. Reed personally deserved credit for accomplishing this recovery without disposing of any of the core businesses."
The proxy also revealed the compensation of Christopher Steffen, the former chief financial officer of Eastman Kodak who joined Citicorp last summer as a senior executive vice president.
Mr. Steffen earned $1.3 million in salary and bonus, as well as stock options, some of which are restricted, that the company said have a current market value of around $2 million.
Mr. Steffen also was credited with 10 years of Citicorp service under the company's retirement plan.
