Mylan Laboratories Inc. said it will report softer-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue because of "severe short-term pricing pressure in some generic products."
Mylan said it expects to report full-year net income in line with the earlier year's record results and it "feels strongly" that fiscal 1995 will achieve substantial gains in sales and earnings.
The Pittsburgh pharmaceutical company reported net income of $21.4 million, or 28 cents a share, on revenue of $61 million in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 1993.
For the full fiscal 1993 year, net income was $70.6 million, or 92 cents a share, on revenue of $212 million.
