All Nippon Airways, Tokyo, the second-largest airline in Japan in terms of sales, expects to report an unconsolidated pretax loss of three billion yen ($28.4 million) for the fiscal year ending March 31, a swing from its earlier prediction of pretax profit of six billion yen, a company spokesman said.
The spokesman cited sluggish demand for air travel on domestic airlines and the resultant softening in ticket prices.
He said a net loss hasn't been recorded since fiscal 1967.
Last month, ANA unveiled a long-term restructuring plan to cut costs and be more competitive.
ANA estimates the plan will help lift its operating margin by 26 million yen for fiscal 1995.
