MB Communications Inc. said the Internal Revenue Service ruled that its planned spinoff of its Micom Communications Corp. unit will be tax-free for shareholders.
MB now must reach agreement with certain noteholders before it can spin off the unit.
The company said it's unlikely the transaction will occur before mid-1994.
Micom designs, makes and markets wide-area networking products for small and medium-size network users.
MB originally announced the transaction in July 1993.
