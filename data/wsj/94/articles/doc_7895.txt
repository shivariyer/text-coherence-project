With President Clinton moving toward a decision on whether to lift the trade embargo on Vietnam, several lawmakers are stepping up efforts to try to influence the outcome.
Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), who follows the Vietnam issue closely and who just returned from a trip there, said yesterday that "the time has come to fully lift this embargo."
But Sen. Robert Smith (R., N.H.), who adamantly opposes such a move, is set to introduce an amendment outlining extensive disclosures that Hanoi would have to make concerning missing U.S. soldiers from the Vietnam War before Mr. Clinton can lift the 19-year-old embargo.
Administration officials said that Mr. Clinton's top advisers have recommended that the embargo be lifted, based on progress the Vietnamese have already made, and that the president may decide the issue as soon as next week.
Last September, Mr. Clinton loosened the embargo by permitting U.S. companies to bid on projects in Vietnam that are financed by international financial institutions.
Mr. Kerry, who last year headed a special Senate committee looking into the fate of the unaccounted-for U.S. soldiers, said during a briefing yesterday that the sanctions have become counterproductive.
He said virtually all other nations ignore the sanctions, and therefore the U.S. is penalizing itself more than Vietnam, whose economy is growing rapidly.
Further, he said, Vietnam has provided significant cooperation in the last two years in helping to resolve the issue.
