Teaching college students about the power of open markets is not easy.
Unfortunately, President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers seems bent on making our job even more difficult ("Widening Rich-Poor Gap Is a Threat to Social Fabric, White House Says," Feb. 15).
According to the council, America's social fabric is threatened by technology, the decline of unions, a lagging minimum wage and immigration.
The Council of Economic Advisers is uncanny.
It identifies four things that make America wealthier, only to condemn all four.
Doesn't the CEA realize that national poverty never promotes social harmony?
New technologies increase wealth.
Mindless "job counting" conceals this from students, but all eventually see that the wheel, the printing press, the automobile, etc., etc. help Americans in all walks of life.
Does the CEA really think that our social fabric would be stronger without such advances?
Declining unions and a lagging minimum wage also make America wealthier.
Unions and the minimum wage distort employment opportunities in America.
Beyond the dollars and cents gains of having more open labor markets, how could equalizing opportunity ever jeopardize the social fabric?
Finally, working immigrants hold out the same promise for America as new technologies.
They help themselves and the Americans who buy what immigrants produce.
Mutually beneficial arrangements like this build the social fabric.
It's the modern welfare state that has undercut immigrants' capacity to strengthen the social fabric.
Throughout our history, the social fabric has been bolstered by the power of open markets.
This is why the "land of opportunity" has been a successful "melting pot."
