CCX Inc. said it will seek the approval of its bondholders and principal lender of a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan.
The Charlotte, N.C., maker of meshes for screening and filtration said the plan calls for the cancellation of all its preferred and common stock outstanding.
If CCX obtains the approval, it will be able to file a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, a company is protected from creditors while it reorganizes its finances.
A prepackaged plan generally permits a company to emerge from Chapter 11 faster than it would otherwise.
CCX said it is seeking a multiyear banking agreement for about $24 million and the conversion of all of the company's $13.7 million in subordinated debt to equity.
Through the first six months, ended Dec. 31, of its current fiscal year, CCX reported a loss of $406,000, or 12 cents a share, on sales of $25.6 million.
In early March, the New York Stock Exchange said trading in CCX's common and 5% cumulative preferred stock had been suspended.
The Big Board said it would apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the stock, citing a failure to meet certain financial criteria.
