Chicago Mercantile Exchange's chairman, John F. Sandner, was elected to a new two-year term.
Mr. Sandner, who ran unopposed for the elected post of chairman, has now served longer than any other chairman of the CME.
"I intend to do everything possible to create new growth and profit opportunities for the members of the CME," Mr. Sandner said.
Mr. Sandner also is chairman of Globex Corp., which runs a 24-hour futures trading network in a partnership with Reuters Holdings PLC and the Chicago Board of Trade.
