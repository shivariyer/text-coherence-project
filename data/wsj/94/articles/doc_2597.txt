Fokker NV said it swung deeply into the red in 1993 because of lower sales, higher financing costs and restructuring charges.
The German-Dutch aerospace group, which is 51%-owned by the Deutsche Aerospace AG unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, racked up 460 million guilders ($238.8 million) of net losses last year compared with a 20 million-guilder ($10.4 million) profit in 1992.
Sales dropped 7.3% to 3.7 billion guilders from 4.1 billion guilders.
The company's 1993 loss would have been substantially larger if not for a big 850 million-guilder drop in operating costs due to drastic restructuring measures that included labor and production cutbacks.
But to cover the costs of restructuring and of sales of aircraft at a loss, Fokker took two charges totaling 365 million guilders.
The net loss was far wider than analysts' expectations of a 150 million to 200 million guilder deficit.
Fokker also said it has asked unions representing its workers for fresh concessions amounting to an effective cut in compensation through 1996.
The proposals are part of a restructuring that will eliminate 1,900 jobs this year alone.
