We at Boston University read with interest your Feb. 14 story about business-school construction.
We were pleased you printed a photo of our planned new School of Management building, but the story missed a major point.
This school has set about to transform the teaching of management.
Curricular reforms address the essential task of understanding the potential and the limitations inherent in management systems, the central issue that has been missing in business education (and in the practice of management).
Our new building has been designed, in every detail, to both deliver management education in new ways and, at the same time, model the kind of effective, horizontally oriented organization about which we teach.
It's functional design will favorably affect the relationships and needs of the people who work and study in it.
