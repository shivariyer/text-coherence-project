Spectrum Information Technologies Inc., the embattled wireless data company, posted wider losses of $12.1 million in its third quarter ended Dec. 31, and closed its mobile services unit.
The third-quarter loss amounted to 17 cents a share, against a profit of $387,000, or a penny a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 58% to $24.4 million from $15.4 million.
For the nine months, Spectrum had a loss of $17.4 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a loss of $6.6 million, or 11 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue rose 40% to $65.4 million from $46.6 million.
The losses follow a restatement earlier this month by the Manhasset, N.Y., company, which led it to report losses instead of profits and lower revenue for its second and third quarters.
Spectrum, which holds patents for sending data over cellular phone networks, is under a federal probe and is the target of a massive shareholder lawsuit.
Spectrum said the loss includes a $4.7 million charge related to the shareholder suit and a special charge of $2.9 million for the shutdown of its Data One mobile unit.
Two weeks ago, Spectrum's high-profile chairman John Sculley quit, charging that Spectrum President Peter Caserta misled him about the company's finances.
The Data One shutdown leaves Spectrum with its cellular technology unit, a computer-distribution subsidiary, which is the source of more than 90% of its revenue, and an engineering rental company.
The company said it is seeking a successor to Mr. Sculley.
