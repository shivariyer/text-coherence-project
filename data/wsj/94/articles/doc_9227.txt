Discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp. reported strong revenue gains, but slower net-income growth raised concern among some investors, and the firm's stock declined 5.6%.
For the fourth quarter, Schwab's net income rose 13% to $29 million, or 48 cents a share, compared with net income of $25 million, or 44 cents a share, in the yearearlier period.
Revenue increased 33% to $258 million from $194 million.
While the company's earnings came near, or just below expectations, analysts are concerned that rising expenses are sapping net income growth.
Nancy Zambell, an analyst with JW Charles/CSG, said Schwab had a 42% increase in compensation and a 43% increase in overall expenses in the fourth quarter.
More worrisome, she added, was Schwab's decline in earnings before income taxes, which dipped to $45.2 million from $45.3 million in the year-earlier period.
"I'm not surprised," Ms. Zambell said of the decline in Schwab's stock.
"This is just a picture of what's going to happen to the brokerage houses shortly.
Since Schwab isn't as diversified as other firms, they're more likely to get hit first."
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Schwab fell $1.75, or 5.6%, to $29.75 a share.
For the year, Schwab's net income rose 45% to $118 million, or $1.98 a share, compared with $81 million, or $1.39 a share, in 1992.
Revenue increased 29% in 1993 to $965 million from $750 million a year earlier.
Schwab's trading volume declined 11% in December, compared with an unusually strong performance in November.
Schwab made an average 38.6 thousand trades a day in December, down from 43.1 thousand trades a day in November.
Meanwhile, combined trading volume on the Big Board and the Nasdaq Stock Market declined about 5%.
For the year, Schwab reported a 29% jump in daily trading volume.
Schwab also increased its quarterly cash dividend to seven cents a share from five cents a share, payable Feb. 15 to shareholders of record Feb. 1.
