ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., the Swiss-Swedish heavy engineering group, signed an agreement with the All-Russia Electrotechnical Institute to form a joint venture in Russia to produce electricity kilowatt-hour meters.
The new joint-venture company, called ABB VEI Metronica, is 80%-owned by ABB and 20%-owned by VEI.
A spokesman for ABB declined to disclose the amount of the company's investment in the joint venture, but said that it's a "fairly small acquisition in a new area, which we feel will be very beneficial."
ABB VEI, based in Moscow, will produce the latest designs of "solid state all-electronic, microprocessor-based ABB 'Alpha' meters for the measurement of electricity consumption and for tariff collection," ABB said in a statement.
