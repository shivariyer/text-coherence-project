Employees at a franchised McDonald's restaurant in Orangeville, Ontario, voted 77-19 against unionizing, reversing an earlier vote.
The employees had voted in favor of unionizing last November when a 17-year-old high-school student led a campaign to improve working conditions for the staff.
But lawyers for the McDonald's franchise challenged the bid before the Ontario Labor Relations Board, arguing that many of the employees had changed their minds soon after voting in favor of unionizing.
After a protracted dispute at the labor board, lawyers for the franchise and the union agreed to hold a second vote as a means of settlement.
Spokesmen for McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd., Toronto, said no McDonald's restaurants in the U.S. or Canada are unionized.
Some McDonald's restaurants elsewhere, including Mexico and Europe, are unionized.
Mark Ortlieb, an official with the Service Employees International Union, said "we're actively seeking other McDonald's" and other fast-food restaurants in Canada for unionization drives.
