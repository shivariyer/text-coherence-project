Unocal Corp. has agreed to pay at least $5.5 million to settle state criminal charges and clean up underground pollution from its large Guadalupe oil field, near San Luis Obispo.
Civil claims by the state are likely to cost Unocal tens of millions of additional dollars, according to company and California environmental officials.
A company spokesman said preliminary settlement discussions already have begun with the state attorney general's office.
This week, Unocal was convicted on three criminal misdemeanor charges of illegally discharging and failing to report massive leaks of a chemical used to dilute the field's heavy crude since the 1950s.
The company's own estimates indicate that millions of gallons of the diesel-like chemical leaked out of storage tanks and pipelines or otherwise contaminated groundwater in 28 separate plumes.
The company had been charged with 36 misdemeanor counts before it negotiated a plea bargain, under which all but three of the charges were dropped.
Unocal pleaded no contest to the remaining charges.
As part of the settlement, it agreed to pay about $1.5 million in penalties and roughly $2 million to continue cleaning up the site.
A Unocal spokesman said another $2 million has been committed to complete the initial phase of the cleanup.
Criminal charges against six employees were dropped as part of the settlement.
Unocal stopped using the chemical in 1990.
Prosecutors had claimed that company officials failed to take action or to report the problem once it had been discovered.
