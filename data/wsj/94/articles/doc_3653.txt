American Cyanamid Co. pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor count of failing to maintain accurate records relating to tests in veterinary-drug studies.
The case, which has been under investigation for several years, had raised eyebrows because it appeared to call into question the Food and Drug Administration's ability to detect fraudulent data in new animal drug applications.
Cyanamid had been cooperating with the federal investigation, which, it noted, "focused on one Cyanamid research employee" who monitored studies done by contract research labs.
The company paid a fine of $200,000 in the case, and reimbursed the government an additional $200,000 to cover costs associated with the lengthy investigation conducted by the Department of Justice and the Food and Drug Administration.
The case involved field-trial data the company filed with the FDA to prove the efficacy of an animal drug, known as Cygro, in combination with other products.
The government became concerned after the head of one independent laboratory contacted the FDA and said that he'd been pressured by a Cyanamid official to alter data.
