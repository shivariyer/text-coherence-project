A House-Senate conference committee approved President Clinton's major education package, favoring provisions that give school districts greater flexibility.
The $422 million plan, called Goals 2000, would establish eight national education goals and set up a panel to devise model academic and testing standards.
The compromise version of the bill still needs to be passed by the House and Senate.
Unless they do so by the end of next week, the bill's $105 million appropriation for this fiscal year will expire.
The conferees settled differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill mainly by making the legislation less prescriptive.
They decided states didn't need to devise so-called opportunity-to-learn standards in their education-reform plans, but can simply describe how they'll ensure student access to such things as up-to-date curricula.
The conferees also included a demonstration project that will allow six states to waive federal regulations that impede local school efforts at reform.
Goals 2000 encourages school reform, but doesn't mandate anything.
If states want to get federal money to improve their schools, they must submit comprehensive plans to the Education Department that explain how they would reach the national education goals.
