Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy outlined a package of proposals to improve the wholesomeness of poultry, but aides couldn't say when they might take effect.
Under a proposed change in the government's finished-product standard, Mr. Espy said, federal inspectors would no longer tolerate any fecal matter on chicken and other fowl.
Other proposals would codify an industry practice -- spraying birds with antibacterial rinses -- and would require the use of bacterial tests on a statistical sampling of birds.
In addition, the Agriculture Department would make a change in inspection procedures to better catch fecal contamination on the processing line, he said.
Steven Kinsella, Mr. Espy's press secretary, said that the proposals haven't been drafted or cleared by the department's lawyers or the White House Office of Management and Budget.
He acknowledged that the rule-making could take several months, including 60 days for public comment, and that the final rules could be challenged in court.
