LDDS Communications Inc., a long-distance telephone carrier, signed a letter of intent to buy ACC Corp. in a stock swap valued at $184.5 million.
Under terms of the acquisition, ACC stockholders would receive one share of LDDS common stock for each of their shares.
ACC, a telecommunications concern in Rochester, N.Y., has approximately 6.8 million shares outstanding.
In trading yesterday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, ACC shares rose 16%, or $3.50, to $25.25 a share, while LDDS fell $1.375, to $27.125, giving the transaction an indicated value of $184.5 million.
Analysts said the deal would be a boon for LDDS, helping the company bolster its global presence and expand U.S. marketing efforts in the Northeast.
LDDS specializes in serving small to medium businesses, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest regions.
ACC is the No. 2 reseller of long-distance telephone services in Canada, which would give LDDS a presence in that market, where its competitors already have strategic alliances, said Theodore Levy, analyst at Safe, Rutty & Co.
Mr. Levy said the Canadian business accounts for about 60% of ACC's revenue.
ACC also has operations in the U.K. and Denmark, he said.
LDDS also would benefit from ACC's sales to universities, Mr. Levy said.
ACC services are used by about 60 universities in the Northeast, which account for about one-third of the company's U.S. business.
Getting into the university niche would help LDDS find more "long-term contracts, with less-volatile income," Mr. Levy said.
