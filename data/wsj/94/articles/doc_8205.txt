CSX Corp.'s Sea-Land Service Inc. said it will spend $250 million for four high-performance, fuel-efficient container vessels and might also modify three vessels in its current fleet.
Sea-Land, a cargo carrier based in Liberty Corner, N.J., said the vessels will be used in the competitive trans-Pacific trade.
The company said it intends to sign construction contracts with Japan's Ishikawajima Harima Heavy Industries Co.
Delivery is scheduled for the second half of 1995 and for early 1996.
