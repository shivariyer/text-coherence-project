Delta Air Lines reported a narrower loss and America West Airlines a profit for the December quarter, results showing that steep cutbacks are beginning to help both carriers.
Atlanta-based Delta reported a loss of $141 million, or $3.36 a share, for its fiscal second quarter.
Included in the quarter was a one-time pretax charge of $112.3 million for the early retirement of nearly 1,500 workers in November.
Without that charge, Delta's loss would have been $71.4 million.
The loss, while still substantial, is an improvement for Delta, which a year ago posted a loss of $144.4 million, or $3.46 a share.
Since then, Delta has slashed its dividend, reduced its staff, cut capital spending further and deferred more aircraft deliveries.
It also withdrew from some unprofitable short-haul flights.
Revenue for the quarter increased 5% to $3.02 billion from $2.87 billion.
Even with all that action, however, Delta still had an operating loss of $180.1 million, while many of its airline rivals had narrow operating profits.
Delta's European routes, bought from Pan Am Corp. in 1991, are still a financial drain on the company, and the airline said the percentage of seats it must fill to break even rose to 67.24% from 64.26%.
The company hinted that more cost cutting may be coming.
"No one at Delta is satisfied with these results, and we are committed to improving our financial performance," said Delta's chairman and chief executive officer, Ronald W. Allen.
In the first half, Delta had a loss of $80.7 million, or $2.71 a share, on revenue of $6.23 billion.
In the year-ago period, Delta had a loss of $856.7 million, or $18.34 a share, on revenue of $5.94 billion.
The year-ago results include a $587.1 million loss from an accounting change.
Delta shares closed yesterday at $54.375, up 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
America West, Phoenix, reported net income of $10.4 million, or 39 cents a share, on revenue of $339.3 million.
That's a big improvement for the carrier, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection for nearly three years, and which clawed its way back to profitability in 1993.
America West has received a proposal for a $250 million investment from Steinhardt Group and has said that other investors are considering bids.
The deadline for those proposals is Feb. 10.
In the year-ago quarter, America West had a net loss of $17.6 million, or 75 cents a share, on revenue of $301.9 million.
For the year, net income was $37.2 million, or $1.47 a share, on revenue of $1.31 billion.
In 1992, the airline had a net loss of $131.7 million, or $5.58 a share, on revenue of $1.29 billion.
