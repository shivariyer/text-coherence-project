Apple Computer Inc. is entering the hotly contested market for computerized TV set-top decoder boxes, in a partnership with software supplier Oracle Corp.
New set-top decoders are needed to deliver new entertainment and education services such as video-on-demand and interactive shopping, over cable and telephone lines.
The two companies said the new set-top box will be based on Apple's Macintosh computer, which uses Apple's proprietary operating system and a microprocessor chip from Motorola Inc.
The new box will work with Oracle Media Server software, which would be used to store and retrieve movies and other multimedia information, the companies said.
They said they plan to deliver the technology on a trial basis in the first half of this year.
Though they provided no more details, sources close to Oracle, Redwood City, Calif., have previously disclosed that the Macintosh technology would be used by British Telecommunications PLC for a trial in the London area.
