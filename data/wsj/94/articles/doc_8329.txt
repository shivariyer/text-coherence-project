Richard P. Delio resigned as chief financial officer of this designer and producer of scientific equipment and services "to pursue other interests," the company said.
John F. Alexander, corporate controller, will assume the responsibilities as acting chief financial officer.
Mr. Delio joined EG&G in 1977 as a group controller, and since then has held several other positions.
In 1991 he was named senior vice president and chief financial officer.
