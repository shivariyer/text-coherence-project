International Musto Explorations Ltd. sued Metall Mining Corp. for allegedly unlawfully soliciting shares of Musto prior to Metall's planned takeover bid for Musto.
Musto, a Vancouver, British Columbia company that holds a large copper and gold deposit in Argentina, filed a suit in a British Columbia court against Metall and McLean McCarthy Inc., a Toronto investment dealer.
The suit alleges that McLean McCarthy unlawfully provided information about Musto's shareholders to Metall, including the investment objectives of some shareholders.
A Metall official said McLean McCarthy didn't provide any unlawful information to Metall.
McLean McCarthy officials weren't available for comment.
