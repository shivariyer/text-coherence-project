A Nissan Motor Co. sales affiliate said in Tokyo that it intends to begin marketing Ford Motor Co. vehicles this spring, in the latest effort by Japan's auto industry to give America's Big Three car makers a foothold in the Japanese market.
Word of the agreement comes as U.S. trade negotiators are in Tokyo to seek a bigger slice of the Japanese market for U.S. cars and auto parts.
Detroit's lack of access to Japanese dealerships has been one of the Big Three's main complaints about Japan's auto industry.
Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales Co. will sell the Ford vehicles at dealerships in the Tokyo area, said spokesman Atsushi Horigome.
Mr. Hirogome said the models and sales volume haven't been decided.
A Ford spokesman in Tokyo said Ford is still studying the proposal.
Ford already shares a dealership network with its Japanese affiliate, Mazda Motor Co., and strengthening those existing dealerships is a priority, he said.
Ford and Nissan already jointly produce minivans.
The deal follows other recent Japan-U.S. sales arrangements, including a pledge by Toyota Motor Corp. to sell 20,000 General Motors Corp. compact cars a year in Japan.
