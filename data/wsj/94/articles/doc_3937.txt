U.S. prosecutors said McKesson Corp. agreed to pay $765,000 to the government to settle charges that a unit submitted allegedly false claims to Oregon's Medicaid program.
Jack Wong, U.S. attorney for Oregon, said McKesson's 3PM division, a third-party biller for Medicaid claims for 44 Oregon pharmacies, submitted more than 353,000 allegedly false claims for "brand medically necessary" prescriptions.
Such prescriptions require brand-name drugs rather than usually cheaper generic ones; the prescriptions require certification from physicians.
Mr. Wong alleged that 3PM didn't have those certifications, resulting in Medicaid paying the pharmacies more than they were entitled to get.
Mr. Wong said the allegedly false claims resulted in overpayments totaling $461,000.
In a statement, McKesson acknowledged that some overpayments occurred, but said they were caused by a computer-software error.
McKesson said that it corrected the software problem upon discovering it, and that the company didn't profit from the overpayments.
McKesson, which also sells bottled water and car-care products, said it agreed to the settlement rather than trying to make its customers, the pharmacies, reimburse the government.
The case is the second recent instance in which large companies have agreed to significant settlements of false-billing charges in Oregon.
Last summer, Pay Less Corp. agreed to pay $1 million to settle similar allegations.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, McKesson shares rose 87.5 cents to $64.125.
