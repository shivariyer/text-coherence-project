When your reporter was researching the Dec. 29 page-one article "Small Manufacturers Display the Nimbleness the Times Require," he asked Mobil to respond to a claim by Ultra Pak Inc., a plastic food-container manufacturer, that it delivers customized products in three days, about one-third the time it usually takes for its larger competitors Mobil and Tenneco to deliver off-the-shelf containers.
You printed the claim but not Mobil's response.
Again: "Mobil sells through distributors who routinely service their customers on a daily basis -- much quicker than three days.
And we will ship stock product direct to an end user to fulfill rush needs in 24 hours or less."
To my mind, that makes Mobil more nimble than Ultra Pak.
