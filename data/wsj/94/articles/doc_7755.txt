Lafarge-Coppee SA, a French building materials group, plans to continue its growth strategy, with five billion to seven billion francs ($842 million to $1.18 billion) in new investments envisioned for 1994, Chairman Bertrand Collomb said.
Mr. Collomb also said that following last fall's rights issue in which Lafarge raised nearly three billion francs in fresh capital, and after a $120 million rights issue by its U.S. unit, Lafarge Corp., the group's net debt-to-equity ratio at the end of 1993 was below 30%.
Lafarge's debt-to-equity ratio was nearly 45% at the end of the first half of 1993.
