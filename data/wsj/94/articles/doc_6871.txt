Channel One, the advertising-supported news program broadcast in schools nationwide, slightly improves students' knowledge of current events, a University of Michigan study concluded.
The study, commissioned by Channel One's owner Whittle Communications L.P., found that high-school students who watched the daily program in 1993 performed an average of 5% better on current-events tests than nonviewing students.
Middle-school students performed 8% better than nonviewers, according to the study.
An earlier Michigan study, which surveyed 1990-1992 viewers, found that Channel One students on average performed only about 3% better on currentevents tests and typically talked or did homework during the broadcast.
Jerome Johnston, one of the researchers, said that even the brightest Channel One viewers learn "much more" if their teachers discuss the meaning of the news on a regular basis.
"Programming alone doesn't improve student learning of current events," he concluded.
Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television, questioned the significance of the study's findings, since Channel One's programming includes some sports and entertainment news.
"What kind of current events are they learning about?
Movie fads and what's happening in the entertainment world?
That's not something they need to learn in schools," she said.
