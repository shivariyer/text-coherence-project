General Motors Corp. said it is recalling a total of 81,900 model-1994 cars and trucks in three separate actions, and the government upgraded its investigations of safety issues involving other auto makers.
In GM's first recall, the auto maker said about 49,000 Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera models with 3.1-liter engines may have defective secondary throttle return springs that could fail, possibly making it difficult to stop the vehicle.
GM said the likelihood of failure is remote since the primary throttle return springs aren't affected.
In another recall, GM said it will make repairs on 32,000 of its Chevrolet Lumina, Pontiac Trans Sport and Oldsmobile Silhouette minivans.
The vehicles' left and right seat belt retractors are reversed, and may not work if the vans are parked on a slope.
Finally, GM said it is recalling 900 half-ton short-bed pickup trucks to tighten four nuts on the fuel tank brackets.
The nuts may loosen, allowing the fuel tanks to drag on the ground.
GM said it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to any of the recalls and that it will make repairs to customers free of charge.
Meanwhile, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it stepped up its investigation of reports of faulty tailgate latches on Chrysler Corp.'s minivans.
The investigation involves four million 1984 through 1994 Plymouth Voyagers, Dodge Caravans and Chrysler Town and Country minivans.
NHTSA said it has received 13 complaints of the tailgate opening in a crash.
There have been reports of eight fatalities and nine injuries as a result.
Chrysler maintains that its tailgate latch isn't defective.
Other investigations upgraded by NHTSA include: Complaints of fuel tank leakage in 1993 Chrysler Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles; reports of faulty fuel pump wiring in 1991 Ford Escort, and potentially defective automatic seatbelts in 1990-1992 model year Pontiac LeMans.
