A McKesson Corp. unit will unveil plans today to extend its managed pharmaceutical care services into the field of home infusion therapy, in a venture it says will cut health-care providers costs for such service by 25%.
Steven I. Geringer, president of the unit, PCS Health Systems Inc., said that by May he hopes to bring on line a network of pharmacies using computers to monitor and manage the drugs infused at home.
These include pain medications, chemotherapy, intravenous nutrition, immune-system boosters and anti-infective drugs.
Home infusion therapy, conceived as a cost-effective way to administer treatment outside the hospital, has recently come under fire for alleged price-gouging.
"We think we've put together a proactive response to a well-publicized problem in this industry," Mr. Geringer said in an interview, adding that he expects the business to be a profitable venture.
PCS already has a major stake in the managed-pharmaceutical business, processing 200 million prescription drug claims totaling $6 billion a year.
Extending such managed-care services to the infusion care industry will save health-care plan sponsors an average of 25% from current outlays, Mr. Geringer asserted.
Home-infusion case management will also allow PCS pharmacists to monitor cases and recommend cost-effective alternatives that can save tens of thousands of dollars per patient, the company said.
In the year ended March 31, 1993, McKesson earned $114.7 million, or $2.69 a share on revenue of $11.67 billion.
