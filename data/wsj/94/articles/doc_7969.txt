The last few years have indeed been tough financial times for U.S. families.
The median net worth of the nation's households tumbled 12% from 1988 to 1991, after adjustments for inflation, the Census Bureau said in a new report.
The drop to $36,623 from $41,472 is mainly the result of declines in home equity, interest-earning assets at financial institutions, checking accounts, rental property and assets held in businesses.
The report found big ethnic differences.
Black families had a median net worth of only $4,604 in 1991 and Hispanic families had $5,345, while white households had a median net worth of $44,408.
However, whites were the only racial group with a statistically significant decline in their net worth during the period.
It fell more than 13%.
The report also found that blacks tend to have a larger percentage of their net worth in homes and cars, while that of whites tends to be based in stocks, mutual funds and certificates of deposit.
Those Americans with annual incomes from $12,852 to $34,968 -- about 20% of the population -- experienced the largest drops in net worth.
The poorest fifth of Americans saw their net worth rise more than 4%, while the richest fifth saw theirs drop 5%.
The distribution of net worth was basically unchanged during the four-year period.
The richest 20% of Americans held about 45% of all the wealth, while the poorest 20% held only 7%.
