Lone Star Industries Inc. said that most of its creditors voted to reject a reorganization plan proposed by equity security holders, which effectively allows a company-sponsored plan to go forward.
The Stamford, Conn., construction-material company, which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since December 1990, said its plan still needs the approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.
A majority of creditors earlier had voted in support of the Lone Star plan.
Under Lone Star's reorganization plan, the company intends to pay between 85% and 100% of about $570 million in unsecured claims on a pro rata basis.
But holders of common stock would see their ownership cut to about 4.5%, while preferred shareholders will recover between 45% to 60% of their claims.
