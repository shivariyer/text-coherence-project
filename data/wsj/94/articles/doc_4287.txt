Pharmaceutical company Liposome Co. said it suspended work on Maitec, a proposed treatment for a certain bacterial infection that attacks people with AIDS.
The company said it wants to focus its resources on products with greater revenue-producing potential.
Brooks Boveroux, chief financial officer, said that a recent evaluation convinced the company that the time and cost for Maitec Phase III trials would have been longer and larger than expected.
The company said it was continuing work on its other products in clinical development, namely ABLC for systemic fungal infections, TLC C-53 for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and TLC D-99 for metastatic breast cancer.
