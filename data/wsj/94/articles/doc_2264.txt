Genentech Inc. said that it has signed an agreement with CytoTherapeutics Inc. to collaborate on that company's research into a treatment for Alzheimer's disease that would use implanted cells to send nerve-growth factor to the brain.
Genentech said it will make an initial $1.3 million payment to CytoTherapeutics and will purchase $3.5 million of the stock of the Providence, R.I., concern.
Genentech will make additional payments totaling $10.5 million as the project advances.
Both companies are biotechnology concerns.
