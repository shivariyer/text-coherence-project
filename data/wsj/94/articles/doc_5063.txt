U.S.-made pharmaceuticals will be more easily available to the medically underserved Russian people following the streamlining of trade procedures for drug exports by the U.S. and Russian governments, the Food and Drug Administration said.
Certain Russian registration procedures concerning the import of drugs have been eliminated.
The Russian government has agreed to waive two provisions, one which requires a complete Russian scientific translation of any possible drug import, and another that calls for separate clinical tests to be performed by Russian scientists.
"There is a great need for imports," said Jim O'Hara, an FDA spokesman.
"Only 28% of the drugs needed by the Russian people are made in the Russian federation."
U.S. companies will be required to submit documents to the Russian government providing assurance that the FDA has approved the drug in question, as well as information about the company itself.
The application will then be reviewed by the Russian ministry of health and medical industry for 90 days.
Mr. O'Hara said U.S. pharmaceutical companies exported approximately $8.5 million of drugs to Russia in 1993.
