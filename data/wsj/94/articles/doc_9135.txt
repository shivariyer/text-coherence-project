Gandalf Technologies Inc. said it will permanently lay off 60 people at its Cherry Hill, N.J., division because of an expected loss in its third quarter ended Dec. 26.
Gandalf Chief Executive Brian Hedges said the results, which are to be reported in February, are "well below expectations."
He said Gandalf expects to report "a significant loss on revenue of $30 million."
In the first six months of fiscal 1994, Gandalf had a net loss of $4.3 million on revenue of $69.2 million.
The Ottawa telecommunications equipment concern also said that several officers had resigned from the company including James Hahn, former vice president of marketing, John Wandell, former president of Gandalf Canada Ltd., and Michael McGrail, former president of Gandalf International Ltd.
Gandalf had 1,366 employees as of last March 31.
