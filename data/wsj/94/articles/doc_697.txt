Mesa Airlines said its previous bid for Ccair Inc., consisting of stock valued at $32 million, has been accepted.
Mesa, a regional carrier based in Farmington, N.M., said its bid values the roughly seven million Ccair shares outstanding at about $4.50 apiece.
At current stock prices, Mesa would swap about 0.2 share of its stock for each share of Ccair.
Ccair is a commuter carrier based in Charlotte, N.C.
Earlier last week Mesa refused to sweeten the value of its bid to about $37.4 million, as suggested by Ccair directors.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market Friday, Mesa closed at $22 a share, down 12.5 cents.
Ccair closed at $4.125 a share, also down 12.5 cents.
