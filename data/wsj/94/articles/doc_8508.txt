Data General Corp., citing disappointing sales in Europe and in its Eclipse minicomputer line, posted a loss of $21.1 million, or 60 cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 25.
That compares with net income of $800,000, or two cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue declined 6.6% to $261.2 million from $279.6 million.
The Westboro, Mass., company blamed a 50% drop in revenue from its Eclipse line and a 30% decline in European revenue for its disappointing results.
However, the company said its Aviion sales continued to climb.
Aviion is a newer system that, unlike the older Eclipse line, can use standard Unix software that also runs on many other makers' computers.
Since the introduction of Aviion four years ago, the company has installed more than 23,000 such systems, resulting in total revenue of more than $1 billion.
