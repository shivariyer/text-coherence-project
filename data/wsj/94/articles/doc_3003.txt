Aetna Life & Casualty Co. said it formed an independent investment-management division to provide advice and asset-management services.
The new unit, Aeltus Investment Management Inc., replaces Aetna Capital Management, a unit in which managers reported to three different Aetna business divisions.
Aeltus, wholly owned by the Hartford, Conn., insurance company, will have complete accountability for its financial results, a spokeswoman said.
Aeltus currently manages more than $20 billion for 600 institutional clients, Aetna said.
