Willow B. Shire, a corporate vice president at Digital Equipment Corp., will resign at the end of month, according to company executives.
The computer maker didn't announce Ms. Shire's decision to resign, which insiders said came last month following a reorganization that changed her responsibilities.
She is a 16-year veteran of the company and had been chief of Digital's health-care-business unit, reporting to Digital's chief executive officer, Robert Palmer.
The 45-year-old executive, one of Digital's top-ranking female officials, was pictured on the cover of Fortune Magazine last year in an article about "Managing Amid Chaos."
She candidly described morale as "very low -- people are tired, frustrated and frightened."
A Digital spokesman said that her departure had nothing to do with her public comments and noted her long record of service to the company.
"She's resigning to pursue other business interests," the spokesman said.
Ms. Shire said Friday that her departure wasn't related to organizational changes, and that she expects to take a position soon working on health-care reform issues.
