TCBY Enterprises Inc. said it opened three franchised frozen-yogurt stores in Egypt, Bahrain and Qatar.
The frozen-yogurt chain said it plans an additional 52 outlets by 1998 in Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and expects to have 20 franchised stores operating in the Middle East by the end of this year.
"Initial sales of frozen yogurt in the region have exceeded all expectations," said Hartsell Wingfield, president of the company's TCBY International division.
