Now I was interested to see in your annual Letter From the Publisher (Jan. 5) your assertion in large italic type that, "Publishing a newspaper is a public trust for which we are accountable first of all to you, our readers."
Somehow, this noble ideal does not seem to square with the statement by William Peter Hamilton, an early editor of the Journal, that, "A newspaper is a private enterprise, owing nothing whatever to the public.
It is therefore affected with no public interest.
It is emphatically the property of the owner, who is selling a manufactured product at his own risk."
OK, times change.
But isn't Hamilton's view of the press more in keeping with the free-men-and-free-markets approach to the world that you apply to everything else?
Why have you abandoned it when it comes to the press?
