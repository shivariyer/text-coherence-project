In her Feb. 1 Letter, Angelique Little said: ". . . the things {Catharine} MacKinnon, and myself, object to (pornography, hate speech, sexual harassment and rape) are odious not because they are immoral but because they degrade, humiliate, oppress and silence women.
Morality has absolutely no place in {the feminist} school of thought; it is completely removed from the subject matter because feminism sprouts not from immorality but from injustice."
My problem is in understanding what Ms. Little could possibly understand by "immorality."
If degrading, humiliating, oppressing and silencing people are not things that make an action immoral, I have no idea what would.
The core of immorality is always some harm to people that is not justified by some higher good or duty.
Ms. Little seems to think that there is a conflict between morality and justice, or at least that they are entirely different spheres.
But surely one of the things that can make an action immoral (unethical) is that it is unjust.
In fact, for many (e.g., Kurt Baier in "The Moral Point of View," Lawrence Kohlberg in his stage theory of moral development, William Frankena in his classic text "Ethics"), justice (in the sense of respecting people's rights or giving them their due) is or comes close to being the essence of morality.
My aim is not to criticize feminism, but to point out that if feminism is to be something other than mere power politics or class conflict, if in fact it claims a basis in justice, then to that extent it is attempting to "dictate morality to men or women," contrary to what Ms. Little suggests.
