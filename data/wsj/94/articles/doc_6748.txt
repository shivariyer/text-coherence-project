Capital Cities/ABC Inc., looking to expand its in-house production capability, is setting up a joint venture with Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, an independent producer with strong ties to the stand-up comedy circuit.
Capital Cities/ABC will finance the venture, which will have an initial capitalization of about $100 million, according to an executive familiar with the deal.
Brillstein-Grey will run the day-to-day operations of the new company, which will be based in Los Angeles and will hire a president and staff of about 30.
The venture will be charged with developing mostly half-hour series for the ABC Television Network, but will also develop progamming for pay-per-view, videocassettes, radio and interactive television.
Capital Cities will have initial rights to any projects, but the new company may sell to other outlets, as well.
"As we move forward into this more complex technological world, the need to own product and software becomes even more critical," said Robert Iger, president of the ABC Television Network Group.
Brillstein-Grey, he said, has "an incredible track record of discovering talent."
Among the projects Brillstein-Grey has produced or packaged are "The Larry Sanders Show" and "Def Comedy Jam" for Time Warner Inc.'s HBO, as well as the movie "Wayne's World."
Brillstein-Grey's motion picture division and talent management business will not be part of the new company.
The company represents about 125 people, including comedians Garry Shandling, Dana Carvey and Mike Myers, actors Nicolas Cage and Brad Pitt, and "Saturday Night Live" executive producer Lorne Michaels.
Brad Grey, one of the principals in Brillstein-Grey, said the company will begin operations in the late spring, once the current network television development season is completed.
He said the company is in talks with Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures Television to handle domestic syndication of any successful series.
