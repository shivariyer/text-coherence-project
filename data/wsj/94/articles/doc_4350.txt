Aircraft makers and banks are expanding into China to tap the world's most promising aviation market and replace business lost from recession-bruised clients in North America and Europe.
As China's economic reforms have gathered speed, so has demand for air travel.
Passenger traffic jumped 33% in 1992 and 25% in 1993.
Assuming traffic growth between 10% and 20%, Chase Manhattan Bank forecast that China will spend $89.7 billion on 1,200 passenger planes through the year 2010, expanding its fleet to 1,593 from 335 in 1992.
Since Beijing deregulated the aviation industry in 1988, the number of Chinese airlines has soared to almost 40 from one.
Airbus Industrie of Europe and McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the U.S. each are opening Beijing units and stationing senior executives in China to nurture government and airline contacts in the market dominated by Boeing Co. of the U.S.
Banks, too, are tripping over each other to get a piece of the action.
A Chase official said that when a Chinese airline recently sought financing proposals, 20 institutions offered their services.
The Swedish government will open its railroad network to new operators, starting next January, by abolishing the system of route monopolies.
The deregulation move is designed to attract more travelers by introducing competition to the state railroad, which will continue to operate passenger and freight trains.
Rail-system functions, such as depots run by the state, may be used by private rivals at cost.
Sweden previously deregulated the aviation, telephone and postal sectors.
Ukraine's economic plight worsened last month, Viktor Yuschenko, the central bank chairman, said.
He told Parliament that debts between Ukrainian enterprises almost tripled to at least $3 billion in January alone, when inflation ran at a monthly rate of 119% and 300 major enterprises -- a third of the total in the former Soviet republic -- shut down.
The government owes $105.7 million in unpaid salaries for January.
Facing a collapse of its currency in the past few months, Ukraine has tightened regulations on trading, though a black market flourishes.
Mr. Yuschenko said capital flight from Ukraine totaled $18 billion in the past two years.
An Australian sex-discrimination case was settled after almost 14 years.
The deal involved about 700 women and Broken Hill Proprietary Co.
Terms weren't disclosed, but Australian media reports estimated the cost to the steel, mining and oil giant at between $3.6 million and $10.1 million.
Under 1970s employment practices discontinued in 1981, the women claimed they had been denied work at BHP's steelworks in New South Wales because of their sex.
Between June 1977 and April 1980, the steel plant employed 4,289 workers, including 58 women; about 2,000 women were put on waiting lists for jobs.
Investment in eastern Germany last year rose 19% to $82.33 billion from a year earlier, but the pace slowed sharply from a 34% jump in 1992, the Ifo Institute for Economic Research said.
And this year, Ifo expects the growth rate to ease to 14%.
The service sector attracted 33% of last year's investment, followed by manufacturing with 30%.
Meanwhile, the government said 1993 new-business registrations in eastern Germany fell 11% to 190,032 from 1992 and slumped 35% from 1991, while 1993 business closures totaled 119,557, down less than 1% from 1992 but up 20% from 1991.
China said it would begin building four nuclear reactors in the next two years in Guangdong province, brushing off concerns in nearby Hong Kong about China's poor industrial safety record.
Beijing insists it meets international nuclear standards.
Two of the plants are planned for Daya Bay, 31 miles northwest of Hong Kong, where China began operating a twin-reactor plant two weeks ago.
The other two will be situated in Yangjiang, a small town about 150 miles south of the British colony.
Initial plans called for a pair of reactors in one of the locations but not both.
But Guangdong is far from China's coal and hydropower energy-producing regions.
The booming province now can supply only 70% of the electricity that its factories need, and it has ambitious plans to attract even more industry.
Moreover, 70% of the electricity being produced by the two new reactors at Daya Bay is being sold to Hong Kong to repay foreign loans for the plant's construction.

Chile's economic growth rate, which was 10.3% in 1992, slowed to 6% in 1993, in line with the government's goal to remain among global pace-setters. . . .
Singapore set up a $630 million fund as a catalyst to develop the republic's core industrial capabilities by making strategic investments with private partners. . . .
Some candidates in Ukraine's parliamentary elections next month are promising voters free funerals.
Government-paid burials would have appeal in the poor republic, where 76% of eligible voters are elderly.
