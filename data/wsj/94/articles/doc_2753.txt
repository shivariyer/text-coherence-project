Tiffany & Co., the jewelry and gift specialty retailer, reported net income for the fourth quarter more than doubled as soft corporate and catalog sales were offset by strong U.S. retail sales.
Tiffany said net income for the quarter ended Jan. 31, rose to $18 million, or $1.14 a share, from $8.7 million, or 55 cents a share, for the year-earlier quarter.
Sales rose 36% to $208 million in the quarter from $152.4 million in the year-earlier quarter.
Tiffany Chairman William R. Chaney said results were supported by "an improving economic climate" that helped Tiffany achieve strong U.S. retail results which ended in a "very successful" holiday season.
But Mr. Chaney warned that "international economic conditions remained difficult with cautious consumer spending affecting sales results in Japan and Europe."
Tiffany's U.S. stores did well, with sales from stores open at least a year up 13% in the quarter and up 8% for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31.
International same-store sales were down for the quarter and year, the company said.
Tiffany operates 79 stores and boutiques world-wide, with 16 in the U.S., one in Canada, six in Europe, and 56 in the Far East, including Japan.
Analysts' concerns over international sales have, in the past, hurt Tiffany's stock.
But yesterday, in late New York Stock Exchange trading, Tiffany shares rose $1 to $32 a share.
Tiffany's U.S. retail sales rose 15% to $97 million in the quarter, and rose 11% to $268.7 million for the year.
Direct-marketing sales, including Tiffany's corporate and catalog units, declined 8% to $30 million in the quarter and declined 2% to $87.4 million for the year, due in part to cautious corporate spending.
International retail sales more than doubled to $81.1 million in the quarter and rose 35% to $210.4 million for the year.
The international sales increase reflects the company's business realignment in Japan in mid-1993.
