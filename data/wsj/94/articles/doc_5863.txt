General Motors Corp.'s three nonautomotive units posted a combined 2.5% decline in fourth-quarter net income, reflecting lower profit by the huge finance subsidiary.
Together, GM's finance, defense and computer-services units had net income in the fourth quarter of $655.2 million, down from the year-earlier $671.8 million.
GM is to report companywide fourth-quarter financial results today.
Securities analysts expect the No. 1 auto maker to post a fourth-quarter profit somewhere between $865 million and $970 million, or $1.15 and $1.31 a share.
That would compare with a year-earlier net loss of $651.8 million.
"We think it was a fabulous quarter," says John Casesa of Wertheim Schroder, whose estimate is on the high end of the range.
General Motors Acceptance Corp., the finance unit, said fourth-quarter net income declined 29% to $207 million from the year-earlier $290 million.
That reflected reduced asset levels and narrower interest-rate margins in North America, which was partly offset by strong international results, GMAC said.
The finance unit was hobbled by the downgrading in late 1992 of the parent company's credit rating, which forced it to pull in its horns and shrink the asset base for a time.
But GMAC maintained that its results for 1993 "reached the high end of our forecast levels."
For all of 1993, GMAC reported net income of $981 million, compared with 1992 earnings of $936 million.
(Excluding the effects of an accounting-change charge, the 1992 operating net was $1.22 billion.)
GMAC said it paid $1.25 billion in dividends to the parent company for 1993, compared with $1.1 billion for 1992.
Electronic Data Systems Corp., GM's computer-services unit, said fourth-quarter net income rose 14% to $202.9 million, or 42 cents a share, from the year-earlier $178 million, or 37 cents a share.
Les Alberthal, the EDS chairman, attributed the gains to a 14% increase in non-GM business during the fourth quarter.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 8% to $2.31 billion.
For all of 1993, EDS said net income hit a record $724 million, or $1.51 a share, on record revenue of $8.56 billion.
That represents a 14% earnings gain from 1992's net of $635.5 million, or $1.33 a share, on revenue of $8.22 billion.
EDS said it lined up $7.03 billion in new contracts during the year.
GM's board earlier this week boosted the dividend on GM Class E shares, which represent an interest in EDS earnings, to 12 cents quarterly from 10 cents.
Class E stock edged down 50 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, closing at $31.875 a share.
GM Hughes Electronics Corp., the defense and electronics unit, reported that fourth-quarter net income rose 20% to $245.3 million, or 69 cents a share, from the year-earlier $203.8 million, or 59 cents a share.
Results for the most-recent quarter include a $32 million charge on the sale of a unit, and results for both periods include a $31 million charge related to GM purchase accounting adjustments.
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 6.8% to $3.70 billion.
GM Hughes said the increase in fourth-quarter earnings largely reflected higher sales of automotive electronics to GM and to non-GM customers.
The company observed that the electronics content rose 8.8% to $853 per GM North American vehicle, and that GM's North American vehicle production rose 15% in the quarter compared with a year earlier.
For all of 1993, GM Hughes net income was $797.8 million, or $2.30 a share, on revenue of $13.51 billion.
The 1993 earnings include a $52.2 million after-tax gain on the sale of a 30% interest in Japan Communications Satellite Co., the $32 million charge on the sale of a unit, and $123.8 million charge related to purchase-accounting adjustments.
That compares with a 1992 net loss of $1.05 billion, or $2.29 a share, on revenue of $12.30 billion.
The 1992 loss includes a special restructuring charge of $749.4 million, an accounting-change charge of $832.1 million and a $123.8 million purchase-accounting adjustment charge.
GM Class H shares, which represent a dividend interest in GM Hughes earnings, closed up 25 cents at $37.75 in Big Board composite trading yesterday.
The GM board earlier this week raised the dividend on Class H shares to 20 cents quarterly from 18 cents.
