Rep. James Leach (R., Iowa) introduced a wide-ranging bill to bolster federal regulation of derivatives, one of the financial world's fastest-growing products.
The proposal would create the Federal Derivatives Commission to draft uniform accounting, capital and other standards for derivatives, which are financial instruments that banks, brokers and their customers use to defray the risk of changes in interest rates, stock prices, foreign-exchange rates and commodities prices.
The bill would place a new layer of federal regulation over insurance companies, which aren't currently regulated by Washington.
It would also impose new "minimum prudential standards" on users of derivatives, including municipalities and pension funds.
Mutual funds that use derivatives would be required to disclose the risks they face.
The bill is certain to trigger stiff opposition from the securities industry.
One purpose of the commission would be to make sure that banks, brokers, insurance companies and others that write and deal in derivatives will play by the same rules.
The bill also would instruct the Federal Reserve Board to seek more uniformity among international standards.
