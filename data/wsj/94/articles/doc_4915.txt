Brutally cold weather in January kept diners at home, but Bob Evans Farms Inc., a restaurant operator and sausage maker, said the weather marks only a temporary setback.
Daniel Evans, chairman and chief executive officer, said strong performance early in the fiscal third quarter ended Jan. 31 makes him feel comfortable with analysts' estimates of about 28 cents to 30 cents a share.
Mr. Evans also expressed comfort with fiscal year 1994 estimates of about $1.15 a share.
In the year-earlier fiscal third quarter, the Columbus, Ohio, company reported net income of $11.4 million, or 27 cents a share, on sales of $169.5 million.
For fiscal 1993, net was $43.1 million, or $1.03 a share, on sales of $653.2 million.
Mr. Evans said storms also forced the company to cut back on expansion plans.
