CompuServe Inc., the nations oldest, largest and costliest on-line computer service to subscribe to, said it will cut its subscriber fees by as much as 40%, citing cheaper technology and lower operating costs.
The H&R Block Inc. unit said it will slash its hourly charges Feb. 6 by as much as 40%, depending on the modem speed subscribers use to access the system.
Subscribers accessing the system with 300 bits-per-second or 1200 to 2400 bits-per-second modems will see the hourly fee drop to $4.80 from $6 and $8 respectively.
Users of higher-speed modems will see their hourly rates drop to $9.60 from $16.
CompuServe's monthly fee remains unchanged at $8.95.
While CompuServe has been integrating less expensive microprocessors, industry insiders say the price cut reflects a more competitive market.
Both Apple Computer Inc. and Microsoft Corp. recently announced their entry into the on-line services market, with more companies expected to jump into the fray in the coming months.
CompuServe's main competitors, Prodigy Services Co. and America Online Inc., aren't planning to wage any price wars.
Fee structures of these services vary so widely that it is "a nightmare to compare them," says Josh Harris, an analyst with Jupiter Communications.
Mr. Harris thinks the cut is too little.
"They're going to have to cut more" to stay competitive, he said.
News of the cuts caused stock of America Online to fall $2.50, or 4.8%, to $50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
H&R Block shares closed at $41.875, up 12.5 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
Prodigy is a partnership of International Business Machines Corp. and Sears Roebuck & Co.
