The Coast Guard moved to require cruise ships to screen baggage with X-ray devices for weapons and explosives.
Under rules proposed by the service, cruise lines would also have to use identification cards for crew members and to light ships at night.
Cruise terminals would have to take similar steps.
The Coast Guard said about 100 ships and 53 passenger terminals would be affected.
The rules would require cruise lines to comply with security standards set by the International Maritime Organization in 1986.
Compliance has been voluntary, and the Coast Guard said many cruise lines haven't adhered to the standards.
The action stems from the murder of an American passenger on the Achille Lauro nine years ago.
Before deciding whether to adopt the rules, the Coast Guard will accept comment on them until June 23.
