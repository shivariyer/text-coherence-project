Cabletron Systems Inc. next week will unveil a next-generation computer network hub, pushing the company into new markets, said Craig Benson, chairman and chief operating officer.
Mr. Benson said the product will offer more data capacity than competitors' products and "will have a major impact on Cabletron's revenue later this year and in 1995."
He said the Rochester, N.H., company has spent $100 million developing the new line.
The product will be unveiled Monday, and the first units will be shipped in May.
Rick Kimball, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, expects Cabletron to post net income for the fiscal fourth quarter ending Feb. 28 of $32.8 million, or $1.15 a share, on revenue of $167 million.
In the year-earlier period, net was $24.5 million, or 87 cents, on revenue of $123 million.
