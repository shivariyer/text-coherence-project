Memorex Telex NV said the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., confirmed its prepackaged plan of reorganization, effective March 24.
The maker of computer-storage and networking systems said its reorganization plan had support from holders of all classes of claims.
The plan, proposed Feb. 11, gives senior bank creditors and bondholders substantially all of the reorganized company's equity.
The Dutch company has executive offices in Irving, Texas and both the parent and its U.S. unit in Irving, Texas, had filed in bankruptcy court.
David Faulkner, vice chairman, said the reorganization leaves the company with a strong capital structure with $100 million of debt, down from $950 million nine months ago, before reorganization.
When the plan becomes effective, new securities intended in the plan will be issued in exchange for debt and equity securities currently outstanding, the company said.
