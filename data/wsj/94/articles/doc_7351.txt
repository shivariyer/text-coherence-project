Opposition is building among big-city mayors to a proposal designed to end the use of political contributions to state and local officials to secure municipal bond business.
"It's a serious concern for all of us," said Chicago Mayor Richard Daley at a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
He and other mayors questioned the proposal's fairness.
The proposed rule would bar a bond dealer from doing business with a bond-issuing jurisdiction within two years of when the dealers, its political action committee or its municipal finance professionals make a political contribution to an official of the jurisdiction.
The rule was fashioned by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and is pending before the Securities and Exchange Commission, which must approve it before it takes effect.
The SEC has invited comments by Feb. 11.
The mayors' conference until now has been silent on the proposal.
But Jerry Abramson, mayor of Louisville, Ken., and president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said mayors will register their concerns with SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and probably the White House.
A draft mayoral statement on the bond rule depicts the proposal as inherently unfair to state and local officials, particularly to those who challenge congressional incumbents.
