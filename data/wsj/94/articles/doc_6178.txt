After months of concentrating most of its lobbying fire on politicians, the Texas Medical Association is planning to move the health-reform battle into the waiting rooms of its 30,000 member physicians across the state.
This month, the TMA will begin mailing doctors pamphlets discussing the possible impact of health-care reform on physician-patient relationships, asking patients how much they value the right to choose their own doctors, and encouraging patients to talk to their doctors about their concerns.
The TMA will urge physicians to put the pamphlets in their lobbies and waiting rooms.
The medical organization also will mail out lists of "talking points" for doctors to raise in conversations with patients, along with regular background papers outlining new proposals and shifts in the health-care debate.
"It's an informational exchange, nothing heavy-handed," says Lou Goodman, the association's director of medical economics.
But at a time when the health-care debate has been dominated by proposals to reduce physicians' fees and encourage the spread of managed-care networks that limit patient choices, Mr. Goodman acknowledges that the campaign is also designed to "strengthen and maintain the traditional doctor-patient relationship."
