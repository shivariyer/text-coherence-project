Walden Books, a book store division of this retailer, named Bruce Quinnell, 45 years old, executive vice president and chief operating officer.
Mr. Quinnell was previously executive vice president, finance and administration, of PACE Membership Warehouse Inc., Englewood, Colo., recently acquired by Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
Walden said it hasn't used the chief operating officer title since Charles R. Cumello was promoted from that post to chief executive officer several years ago.
