Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. reached tentative agreement to settle shareholder litigation by paying $1.6 million, the home-building company said in its annual financial statement.
Two lawsuits filed in federal court here in 1992, later consolidated, had alleged that the company and several of its officers had issued misleadingly upbeat financial projections in the two months before an announcement that profit would decline.
The company, which is paying the $1.6 million as its share of a larger settlement, has denied all wrongdoing, and said it reached the agreement in principle to avoid a costly and protracted legal fight.
The settlement awaits finalization by attorneys and court approval.
