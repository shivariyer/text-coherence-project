President Clinton turned down an offer by the Health Insurance Association of America to coproduce a television commercial with the White House emphasizing areas of agreement on health-care reform.
The trade group has spent $10 million on the "Harry and Louise" ads that are harshly critical of the Clinton health proposal, but it has softened its tone markedly in recent days.
In a letter to Bill Gradison, the association's president, Mr. Clinton said it was "heartening to hear" that the association says it's in favor of some main parts of the administration proposal -- universal coverage, a comprehensive benefit package, a requirement for all employers to help pay for their workers' medical insurance, and certain insurance market reforms.
But Mr. Clinton noted that the White House is prohibited by law from running advertisements and asked that the association "join with us" in promoting the White House proposal.
"We're delighted with the president's very positive response, which shows that we're exactly on the same wave length" on the "central issue" of universal coverage, Mr. Gradison said.
He added that the health-insurance group has no current plans for any ads -- either critical or supportive.
Harry and Louise last aired at the end of February.
