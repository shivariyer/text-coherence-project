Alberta Energy Co. said it will seek approval at its annual meeting April 13 for a shareholder-rights plan that would force would-be suitors to bid for all the company's voting shares.
The Calgary, Alberta, energy and natural-resources company said its board adopted the plan, which takes effect immediately "as part of the normal governance process."
It said it isn't aware of any impending change in ownership.
Alberta Energy said that under the plan, any takeover offer must be extended to all its shareholders.
It said that for the bidder to acquire any shares under such an offer, at least 50% of shares not held by the bidder must be deposited.
