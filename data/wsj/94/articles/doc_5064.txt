Proteon Inc., as it had forecast, reported a fourth-quarter loss as sales plummeted and took a $5.4 million restructuring charge and wrote down inventories.
For the quarter, the Westborough, Mass., maker of computer-network equipment posted a loss of $13.7 million, or 93 cents a share, compared with net income of $252,000, or two cents a share.
Latest quarter results reflect a restructuring charge of $5.4 million, or 37 cents a share, related to the layoff of 40 employees, or 10% of the work force, and write-downs of inventories.
Sales plunged 35% to $20.4 million from $31.6 million.
Proteon said the decline reflected competitive pressures, customers waiting for a generation of network-circuit cards introduced during the quarter and lengthening sales cycles.
Proteon closed at $7.125, up 50 cents, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday.
