Farmers & Mechanics Bank, Middletown, Conn., said it plans to enforce a three-year restriction on any group purchasing 5% or more of its shares without board approval to protect a tax benefit.
The bank, which went public in December, had a recent flurry of investor interest after a group disclosed in a filing that it had purchased 8.52% of the bank.
Bank officials said the group, which they didn't identify, wasn't interested in a takeover bid for the bank.
They also said that after discussing the restriction with the group, they believe the group will try to comply.
The bank has about $9.5 million of deferred tax benefits.
