American Telephone & Data Inc. said it got a loan of $650,000 from a privately held investment group based in Vancouver, British Columbia, to further finance its operations.
The Newport Beach, Calif.-based company said the loan is secured by a debenture on an undisclosed amount of outstanding shares of its T.W. Communications Inc. unit, and additionally secured by contracts with its long-distance carriers and customers.
The company said the lender also receives an option to purchase common shares at $2 a share over a two-year period.
In addition, the company said the lender will appoint three new board members to replace existing directors.
