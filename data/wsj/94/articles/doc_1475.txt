Columbia Laboratories Inc. expects to report a loss of between 40 cents and 50 cents a share for 1993, Nicholas A. Buoniconti, vice chairman, said.
For the year, the Miami developer of women's drugs expects to report sales of slightly more than $8.1 million and a net loss of slightly less than $8.5 million.
In 1992, Columbia had a loss of $8.5 million, or 51 cents a share, on sales of $9.2 million.
The losses for both years were expected, as Columbia continues testing and developing marketing for its four major drugs.
For the fourth quarter, Columbia expects a loss of approximately $2.6 million on sales of slightly less than $2 million.
That compares with a loss of $3.9 million on sales of $1.9 million in the same period of 1992.
Columbia recorded a loss of 23 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1992, and Mr. Buoniconti said in an interviw that the fourth-quarter loss per share for 1993 would be about half that figure.
Columbia has high hopes for four different women's products, each of which is administered in gel form into the vagina.
Mr. Buoniconti expects operations to become profitable sometime in 1995.
