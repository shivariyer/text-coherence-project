Today's Man Inc., pleased with record volume at its first Manhattan store, said it is considering opening two to three additional stores in New York City.
Shares of the company, which operates low-priced menswear stores, jumped $1.25 to $15.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday.
The additional Manhattan locations would increase the company's presence in the New York metropolitan area to 20 stores.
Today's Man said three newly opened stores in Chicago were performing well, and a fourth Chicago store is expected to open in the third quarter.
The company, which is based in Moorestown, N.J., plans to open a fifth Chicago store in early 1995, and to eventually operate eight to 10 stores in the Chicago market.
