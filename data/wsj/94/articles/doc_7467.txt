Iomega Corp., a computer-storage supplier, reported a fourth-quarter loss of $17 million, or $1.15 a share, on sales of $37.5 million.
The Roy, Utah, company attributed the loss to a restructuring charge of $12.6 million, mainly for asset write-downs and costs related to an unspecified number of layoffs and the establishment of reserves associated with certain product lines.
Iomega also expects a loss in 1994.
Notwithstanding the restructuring, Iomega reported a pretax loss of $3.8 million.
It blamed a 25% cut, effective Sept. 1, in the price of its Bernoulli products for the decline.
A year earlier, Iomega earned $41,000 on sales of $37.5 million.
For 1993, Iomega had a loss of $14.5 million, or $1.16 a share, on sales of $147 million.
For 1992, it earned $4.7 million, or 29 cents a share, on sales of $139 million.
