Japan will abolish its voluntary restrictions on automobile exports to the U.S., the head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai announced in a news conference yesterday.
Mr. Kumagai said auto exports to the U.S. have been on the decline since the fiscal year that began in April 1987.
As Japanese car makers continue to step up local production, exports to the U.S. are likely to keep declining, making the export caps unnecessary, he said.
In the current fiscal year, Japan has exported 1.40 million autos to the U.S., down from the 1.57 million units in fiscal 1992, Mr. Kumagai said.
Since the voluntary caps were implemented several years ago, they have been meaningless because auto exports to the U.S. from Japan have continued to come in well below the restrictions.
