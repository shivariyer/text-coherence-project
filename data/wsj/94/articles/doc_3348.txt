Brooke Group Ltd., Miami, said an agreement to exchange its stake in New Valley Corp. for $89 million of debt and $22 million of cash was revised and extended to Sept. 30.
The agreement was set to expire March 31.
Brooke Group, which is primarily a tobacco company, owns 42% of the common and 43% of the Class A preferred of New Valley, parent of Western Union Financial Services Inc.
New Valley, of Upper Saddle River, N.J., has been operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since May 1992.
Under the revised agreement, the debt portion would remain the same.
Instead of the cash payments, the participating noteholders will extend additional loans to a Brooke Group subsidiary and forgive all loans and other obligations totaling about $22 million if the exchange offer closes by the end of the extension.
