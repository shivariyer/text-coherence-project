Horizon Healthcare Corp. completed its acquisition of Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc. after reaching an accord with regulators who were concerned about Horizon's record of patient care.
Nursing-home operator Horizon, Albuquerque, N.M., paid $47.1 million in stock for Greenery, which has 20 rehabilitation hospitals.
Horizon also assumed $54.7 million in Greenery debt.
In December, Massachusetts regulators moved to delay the transaction, citing instances of patient mistreatment at Horizon facilities in Ohio.
Greenery is based in Newton, Mass.
Horizon said Friday it agreed to set up a special management team that will monitor Horizon's patient care in Massachusetts for 18 months and provide monthly reports to the state.
Greenery shareholders will receive one Horizon share for every Greenery share.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Horizon closed at $23 a share, unchanged.
Greenery closed at $5 a share, down 12.5 cents.
HORIZON HEALTHCARE Corp. will pay Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc. shareholders 0.25 share of Horizon stock for each Greenery share held.
An article yesterday incorrectly stated that Greenery shareholders will receive one Horizon share for every Greenery share.
