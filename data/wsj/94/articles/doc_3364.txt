Stewart Enterprises Inc. expects to report a jump of at least 52% in its fiscal first-quarter profit, thanks to an aggressive pace of acquisitions and strong sales of prearranged funeral services.
The New Orleans company estimated net income for the period, ended Jan. 31, at $6.5 million to $6.9 million, or 33 cents to 35 cents a share, up from $4.2 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier.
The results are adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split in November.
In an interview, Ronald Patron, chief financial officer of the funerary-services concern, said revenue in the quarter rose at least 37% to between $56 million and $58 million, from $40.8 million a year earlier.
Lawrence Berner, president and chief executive, said he expects Stewart to subtantially increase its rate of acquisitions.
So far this fiscal year, the company has acquired nine funeral homes and seven cemeteries.
