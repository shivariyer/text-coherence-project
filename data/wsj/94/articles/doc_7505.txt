Italian state airline Alitalia swept out its top management and is hoping that two U.S. computer-industry executives will be able to turn around the carrier's fortunes.
Renato Riverso, IBM Europe's top executive, was named Alitalia's new chairman.
Roberto Schisano, head of Texas Instruments Europe, was named to the No. 2 spot of managing director.
Alitalia said the previously ceremonial post of chairman will be granted some executive powers.
Until now, nearly all of the management power rested with the managing director, Giovanni Bisignani.
He and several other top managers will leave the airline.
Mr. Bisignani, 47 years old, has headed Alitalia since 1989.
He will move to a small state-run shipping company, Tirrenia.
Alitalia hasn't turned a profit since 1988, with losses totaling 366 billion lire ($216 million) from 1989 to 1992.
Analysts estimate a loss of more than 300 billion lire for 1993 alone.
Mr. Riverso's departure from IBM Europe, a unit of International Business Machines Corp., had been announced.
He is leaving at the normal IBM retirement age of 60 next month.
During his three-year tenure, the big European operations became a problem child for IBM, although computer-industry analysts generally blamed the woes on a sagging European computer market and world-wide strategy problems at IBM.
Under Mr. Riverso's watch, IBM's European work force fell by roughly 25%, to 77,000.
Mr. Schisano is a former chairman of Texas Instruments Europe, the European subsidiary of Texas Instruments Inc.
