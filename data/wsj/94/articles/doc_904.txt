A proposed initial public offering of Virgin Interactive Entertainment PLC has been delayed indefinitely following sudden proposals for the company by outside bidders, according to people close to the transaction.
The new bidders aren't publicly known but are believed to be major entertainment companies.
And their sudden appearance suggests that Virgin's effort to sell about a 10% stake to the public has been superceded by relatively lavish offers for the whole company.
Currently, Virgin Interactive is about 64%-owned by British investor Richard Branson, trusts held by his family and his associates.
Video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. acquired a 20% stake in Virgin Interactive in January, with options to expand that stake to about 33%.
And toy maker Hasbro Inc. bought a 16% stake last September.
Based in Irvine, Calif., Virgin Interactive has been part of Mr. Branson's stable of entertainment operations.
Its role as the publisher and distributor of a number of successful computer-game titles, including games based on Walt Disney Co.'s films "Aladdin" and "The Jungle Book," as well as a widely distributed mystery game, "The 7th Guest" has made it a widely anticipated initial public offering.
People close to Virgin Interactive said that negotiations with two or more bidders for the company were intense and that some indication of the company's future probably will emerge soon.
The proposed initial public offering of American depositary shares was to have included one million shares newly issued by the company and 850,000 shares offered by Mr. Branson's interests and associates.
A price of $20 a share had been expected.
