American International Group Inc. said its American Life Insurance Co. unit formed a company to market dollar-denominated life insurance products in Argentina.
The new company, Alico Compania de Seguros De Vida SA, will be based in Buenos Aires and will target the middle-income market, selling primarily through a network of agents.
Recent changes in Argentina permit full foreign ownership of licensed insurance companies and remove certain limitations on foreign currency transactions and investments, according to AIG, a New York-based insurance concern.
