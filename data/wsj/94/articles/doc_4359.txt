Novell Inc. said net income for its first quarter ended Jan. 29 edged up about 3% to $72.8 million, or 23 cents a share.
The computer-networking concern's earnings were in line with analysts' estimates, but Novell stock dropped, closing at $23.625, down 87.5 cents, in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Revenue for the period jumped 20% to $311.4 million from $260.2 million a year earlier.

In the latest period, Novell in Provo, Utah, had 313.9 million shares outstanding, compared with 310.9 million shares outstanding a year ago.
Novell said net income was held down by expenses related to several acquisitions.
Those costs contributed to a marked decline in Novell's operating profit margin, which dipped to 32% from 39% a year earlier.
