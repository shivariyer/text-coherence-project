Car rental rates are going up, again.
Industry leader Hertz Corp. said it's raising prices on weekly rates $10 to $30, a 6% to 18% increase.
Daily rentals are rising by up to $5, or 15%.
Avis Inc. said it has already raised rates in certain markets and will evaluate Hertz's move.
A spokesman for National Car Rental System Inc., a unit of General Motors Corp., said: "Everyone is trying to take rates up, and we probably will, too."
The latest price action reflects a two-year trend of rental companies' trying to push up prices in response to higher costs from auto manufacturers.
For '94 models, the increase in costs is 30%, according to rental company officials.
For years, rates were flat, because car makers, suffering from excess inventory, subsidized car rental companies to buy their surplus autos.
But as Detroit's overcapacity problems have abated, the car rental subsidies have disappeared -- and rental rates have risen.
Fortunately for consumers, competitive pressures keep prices from rising too steeply.
In September, as '94 models came onto the lots, rental companies tried to raise rates by 12%, but the increase settled at 5%.
The current Hertz-led increase, first disclosed in USA Today, comes as rental companies bring on board their second wave of '94 cars.
"Those new cars are coming in, and we believe rates need to go up overall," said an Avis spokeswoman.
"It's a matter of survival."
