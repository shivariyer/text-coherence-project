Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Cos. said it has purchased 73,402, or about 15%, of its 11 1/2% senior subordinated discount notes due in 2002.
The purchases, made on the open market for about $48.5 million, were part of a plan to consolidate and simplify its capital structure, the soft-drink maker said.
They were funded by the company's bank credit agreement.
The company said 388,829 discount notes are still outstanding.
