Troubled Gitano Group Inc., which was put up for sale last month, said that it expects to announce a buyer by early next week, when the apparel maker is also expected to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
According to people familar with the situation, Gitano has been weighing bids that were submitted from apparel companies including Fruit of the Loom Inc., VF Corp., Oxford Industries Inc. and privately owned Gelmart Industries Inc.
None of those companies returned phone calls seeking comment.
Declining to identify the bidders, Robert Gregory, Gitano chairman, said: "We are pleased at the response that we've gotten from potential buyers and we expect to make an official announcement early next week."
Industry sources have speculated that Gitano will be sold for no more than $60 million, which is well below the $130 million Gitano owes its creditors.
Therefore, Gitano will probably file for Chapter 11 protection as soon as it decides on a buyer, Mr. Gregory said.
As reported, Gitano put itself up for sale after its largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said it would stop buying from Gitano, which pleaded guilty to customs violations last December.
