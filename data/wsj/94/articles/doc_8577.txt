Chrysler Corp. will pay its more than 65,000 United Auto Workers employees $4,300 each in profit sharing, a record for a U.S. auto maker, Chrysler said.
The auto maker also posted sharp sales gains in Europe.
The Chrysler payments, to be made Feb. 11, are more than 10 times last year's $421 payments.
Chrysler's 16,000 nonunion salaried employees also will receive profit-sharing payments, Chrysler said.
Ford Motor Co. also is expected to make a profit-sharing payment as workers begin to reap the benefits of the automotive industry upturn.
Separately, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said Chrysler was one of two manufacturers to post an increase in European sales in 1993.
The European vehicle market plunged 15.1% to 11.5 million vehicles, but Chrysler, although a minuscule player, increased its sales 39.4% to 52,610 vehicles.
Chrysler's market share rose to 0.5% from 0.3% the year before.
The Rover Group also posted a sales increase for the year, up 9.7%.
Ford of Europe and General Motors Co. both posted decreases in sales for the year but increases in market share.
Ford's market share rose to 11.5% from 11.2% in 1992 and GM's rose to 13% from 12.5%.
