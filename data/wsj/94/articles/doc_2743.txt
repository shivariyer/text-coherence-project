Moore Business Systems Australia Ltd., a business-forms printing unit of Moore Corp. of Canada, said it will restructure its operations and cut staff by about 100.
Moore currently employs 1,400 in Australia.
Tim Baker, managing director of Moore in Australia, said in a statement that the company will close its Alexandria plant in Sydney and upgrade plants in Wodonga and Moorebank to improve efficiency.
The restructuring follows Moore's acquisition in November of Computer Resources Co., a company that prints shortrun complex business forms and tickets.
