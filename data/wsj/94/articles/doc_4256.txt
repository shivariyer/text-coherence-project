I appreciated Michael Allen's story in your Feb. 16 edition: "The Wonk of All Wonks: Sharp Offers Master Plan."
However, after sending my "extensive think tank" scrambling to the dictionary for the meaning of the word "wonk," they have just reported back to me their failure to find the word therein.
I have now asked my research staff to determine whether the public approves or disapproves of "wonks."
If it turns out that the public approves, please disregard this letter.
