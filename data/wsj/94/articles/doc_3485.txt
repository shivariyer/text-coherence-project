Southern Electronics Corp. said it hired Salomon Brothers Inc. to consider "strategic alternatives" for the company, including a possible sale, merger or acquisition.
Southern Electronics, a distributor of microcomputers, computer-peripheral products and cellular-telephone equipment, said it is looking for ways to grow in the increasingly competitive electronics-distribution industry.
As more companies consolidate, Southern Electronics said it has to move from a regional player to a national player to survive.
"It's a situation where leaders are developing, and we want to remain a leader," said Larry Ayers, vice president for finance.
Mr. Ayers declined to say whether the company is more likely to merge or be sold.
However, in a statement released late yesterday , Southern Electronics said "one of the alternatives that might be considered could result in a possible sale of the company or other type of transaction resulting in the change of control in the company."
Southern Electronics has had two slow quarters as it tries to slim down and reduce expenses.
In its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, the company earned $1.6 million, or 22 cents a share, down from $2.1 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose to $74.8 million from $60.9 million.
In fiscal 1993, the company reported sales of $249.5 million.
The company disclosed its actions after the markets closed.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Southern Electronics closed at $9.625, unchanged.
