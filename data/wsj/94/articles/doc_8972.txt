ICC Technologies Inc. said its shareholders approved the transfer of substantially all of the company's assets to a joint venture with Engelhard Corp., in return for a 50% stake in the venture, which will develop air-conditioning systems.
ICC Technologies, a Philadelphia maker of air-conditioning systems, said Engelhard will contribute $10 million and provide credit support of $3 million, along with certain technology rights, to the joint venture.
Engelhard, of Iselin, N.J., makes specialty-chemical products and other materials, and its absorption materials will be used in the cooling and dehumidification systems developed by the joint venture.
When the transaction is completed, ICC Technologies will become principally a holding company, with the venture stake as its primary asset.
Its stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market as a small-capitalization issue.
