Sadly, people with mental, alcohol and drug abuse disorders are all-too-easy targets at budget-cutting time ("Tax-Subsidized Addicts," Review & Outlook, Feb. 8).
But let's not confuse real illnesses with poor funding for what are potentially real solutions.
The program your editorial described was never intended as a "handout" to addicts.
The laudable idea was to create incentives for people to get into treatment by sending their subsidies to representative payees, which could include treatment programs, family members or others who would directly encourage them into treatment.
Unfortunately, while the idea is sound, the Social Security Administration has never had the resources -- and perhaps the will -- to adequately implement and oversee the program.
Yet people still need help, and those who are addicted are no less disabled than persons with physical disabilities.
Their problems are real, and they don't go away by simply pulling the plug on entitlement programs.
In fact, we all pay through both direct treatment expenses and through the indirect costs of lost or reduced productivity, accidents and crime -- a whopping $273.3 billion in 1988 -- for the effects of untreated mental, alcohol and drug abuse disorders.
Let's fix any problems in the funding and management of government entitlements, but let's not blame people with addictions for government inefficiencies.
