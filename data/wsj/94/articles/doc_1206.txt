Canyon Resources Corp. said it is holding talks with a major gold mining company in an effort to increase its 30% interest in the Seven-Up Pete Joint Venture, which holds a mining prospect in Montana.
Canyon's announcement follows a decision by Phelps Dodge Corp., the 72% holder of the 8.2 million-ounce project, to investigate whether to sell its interest in the gold prospect or continue with plans to develop it into a gold mine.
Phelps Dodge, a copper producer in Phoenix, said it wants to make the decision to hold or sell before the joint venture begins the process of acquiring government permits to develop the mine.
Canyon said it is discussing the possibility of buying Phelps Dodge's share of the project with the major mining company that it declined to name.
A spokeswoman for the small gold-mining company said it has $20 million in cash and is considering paying for an additional share of the project with cash or a combination of cash and other financing.
