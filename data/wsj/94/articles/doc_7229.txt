Hitachi Ltd. expects its earnings to begin improving in the six months ending March 31, reversing two years of declining pretax profit.
In an interview, director Yoshiro Kuwata said that "we think our earnings have hit bottom.
We expect some improvement in the next half and in the future."
For the year ended March 31, 1993, the Japanese electronics and heavy power equipment maker's consolidated sales fell 2.9% to 7.536 trillion yen ($68.48 billion), and group pretax profit slid 37% to 234.74 billion yen.
While Mr. Kuwata wouldn't disclose specific forecasts, he said the company is beginning to see benefits from a rationalization program that has emphasized transfer of production to overseas locations.
A strong yen eroded the competitiveness of Hitachi products made in Japan.
Hitachi currently makes roughly 30% of its products outside Japan.
