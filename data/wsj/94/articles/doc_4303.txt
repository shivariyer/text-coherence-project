Sterling Winthrop Inc. named Jacques F. Rejeange, president of the company's pharmaceuticals group, to the additional titles of president and chief operating officer.
Mr. Rejeange, 53 years old, succeeds Louis P. Mattis, 52, who will remain as chairman and chief executive officer of the Eastman Kodak Co. health unit, which has about $2 billion in annual revenue.
The company said the move, which places Mr. Rejeange in charge of day-to-day operations, will allow Mr. Mattis to focus on strategy, alliances and joint venture opportunities.
"This will help us give more attention to the health-care agenda and the rapid reorganization of the heath care market," Mr. Rejeange said.
Mr. Rejeange said that he will concentrate on building Sterling Winthrop's overseas business.
In the U.S., Sterling Winthrop has the sales and marketing rights to Bayer aspirin.
"The challenge is to try to accelerate and foster global development and reduce dependency on the U.S. market," Mr. Rejeange said.
Before coming to Sterling Winthrop in 1992 as an executive vice president, Mr. Rejeange had been president and chief executive officer of Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corp., a division of Sandoz Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.
At Sandoz, Mr. Rejeange held assignments in Switzerland, Hong Kong, the U.K., France, Belgium and the U.S.
