Transamerica Corp. said it completed the purchase of the container assets of London-based Tiphook PLC for about $1.1 billion.
Transamerica said the price was adjusted downward from the $1.2 billion announced in November, primarily because the deal now covers 501,000 equivalent container units, down from the 526,000 originally envisioned.
The deal makes Transamerica, a financial-services firm, the second-largest lessor of containers.
