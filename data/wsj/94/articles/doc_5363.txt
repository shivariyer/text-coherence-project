French oil company Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine said yesterday it will pursue plans to build a new 10-million-ton refinery at Leuna in eastern Germany, only if future partners in the venture will allow it to take a minority stake.
The move is the latest twist in a dispute between Elf and the Treuhandanstalt, the German privatization agency, over the extent of Elf's commitment to the project.
Elf says that economic conditions have changed since 1992 when it originally agreed to take a two-thirds stake in the refinery project.
Its partner German trading company Thyssen Handelsunion AG had said it would take one-third.
Elf has said it wants partners to alleviate its burden.
Elf and Thyssen acquired the LeunaWerke AG refinery and the Minol AG filling-station network from the Treuhandanstalt.
Their selection as the winning bidder was linked to commitments to modernize the network, upgrade the existing refinery, and build a new plant at Leuna.
The total investment was estimated at six billion marks ($3.43 billion) to seven billion marks.
An Elf spokesman wouldn't say whether the company had actually found any other partners willing to participate on a minority or other basis.
A spokeswoman for Treuhand said the agency had no comment other than that talks with Elf are continuing, with the next meeting scheduled for Thursday.
