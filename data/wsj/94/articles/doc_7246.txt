The Justice Department cleared an Eaton Corp. divestiture that will allow Eaton to acquire a unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp.
Under the plan, Cleveland-based Eaton will sell assets used in the manufacture of switches and circuit breakers and then acquire Westinghouse's distribution-and-control unit, which makes similar devices.
The $1.1 billion acquisition will enhance Eaton's diversification and allow Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse to cut its heavy debt.
An Eaton spokesman said the company is hopeful the transaction will be completed soon.
Eaton's sale of its assets to Thomas & Betts, of Memphis, enabled the Justice agency to permit the Eaton-Westinghouse deal to go unchallenged.
"This divestiture preserves competition for the sale of basic products that are essential for the safe use of electricity so that homeowners, businesses and other buyers are ensured the best quality products at the lowest possible prices," said Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general for antitrust.
