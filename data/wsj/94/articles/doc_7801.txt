The Municipal Securities Rule-making Board proposed specific record-keeping requirements for gifts and gratuities made by municipal-bond dealers in their business dealings.
The proposal by the MSRB, which recently filed a rule to end "pay-to-play" political contributions by dealers to state and local government officials, would modify an existing antibribery rule.
The proposed rules would require dealers to keep specific records on gifts and gratuities given in relation to municipal-securities activities.
Dealers would have to keep records for six years.
The board's current gifts-and-gratuities rule bars a dealer from giving directly or indirectly anything of value in excess of $100 a year to any person, other than an employee or partner, in connection with its municipal-bond activities.
The rule doesn't cover charitable giving, and has no record-keeping requirement.
The current rule exempts "normal business dealings" from the $100 annual limit.
These include such things as occasional gifts of meals or tickets to theatrical or sporting events, as well as the sponsoring of business functions that are recognized as deductible business expenses.
The board yesterday said it is considering whether to write a new definition of "normal business dealings" and requested comments on the matter.
MSRB Chairman David Clapp of Goldman, Sachs & Co. said the proposed record-keeping requirement would apply to all gifts and gratuities, including those allowed under exceptions to the underlying rule.
