Cigna Corp. said it is combining its international property-and-casualty and its international life and employee-benefits operations.
The insurance holding company said the combined operations, renamed Cigna International, will be managed by H. Edward Hanway, 42 years old, president of the property-and-casualty international unit.
The combined operations are to have $2.2 billion in revenue.
A spokesman said the move provides economies of scale in delivering products and services overseas.
The company also named Thomas C. Jones president of Cigna Property & Casualty Reinsurance effective July 1.
Mr. Jones, 48, was executive vice president, chief operating officer and a director of NAC Re Corp. and succeeds Norman Wayne, who left the company last fall to pursue other interests.
Cigna Property & Casualty Reinsurance had more than $500 million in revenue in 1993.
It provides financial reinsurance products, among others, to domestic and international markets.
