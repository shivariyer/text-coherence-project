A consortium including German utilities RWE AG, Preussen-Elektra AG, and Bayernwerk AG will pay eight billion marks ($4.65 billion) for eastern German electricity generator Veag, the German government said.
A separate consortium also including RWE, Preussen-Elektra and Bayernwerk will pay 2.1 billion marks for eastern German coal producer Laubag.
The sale of the formerly state-controlled companies to western German buyers was agreed on as early as 1990 in a contract with the then East German state, but it was held up for years by a longstanding dispute between consortium members and eastern German local authorities.
