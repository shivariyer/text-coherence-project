Political unrest in Mexico and higher interest rates drove small-company stocks sharply lower, but they managed to finish above their lows for the session.
The Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization issues sank 3.13, or 1.16%, to 267.07.
Nasdaq issues, as measured by the Nasdaq Composite Index, dropped 10.83, or 1.36%, to 786.68.
Both indexes posted their biggest oneday declines since Feb. 4, when prices slid sharply following a move by the Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
Nasdaq decliners easily topped advancers, 2,037 to 1,039, on Nasdaq National Market volume of 318,577,100 shares and total volume of 373,500,500 shares, the fifth highest ever.

The Mexican stock market was closed yesterday.
The unrest in Mexico helped fuel a slide in the U.S. Treasury 30-year bond, which shed nearly 3/4 point and saw its yield climb to 6.95%.
American depositary receipts of Mexican companies fared poorly.
Empresas La Moderna, a cigarette company, fell 2 1/4 to 25 7/8; Bufete Industrial, a construction concern, slipped 1 1/4 to 35 3/4; and Grupo Mexicano de Desarollo dropped 1 5/8 to 19 7/8.
All three are traded on the Big Board.
The selling spilled over into other ADR dealings.
Some Chilean issues, for example, were also hurt.
"When something like this happens, everybody gets hit," said Juan Mesa, a vice president and head of Latin American equity research at J.P. Morgan Securities.
"This was not a good day for equities in general, but our sense is that the government of Mexico will come out strongly tomorrow to reduce uncertainty, and there will be limited further downward pressure."
Among Big Board-listed Chilean issues, ADRs of Compania de Telefonos de Chile lost 3 to 91, and Maderas y Sinteticos SA Masisa fell 1 1/8 to 25 3/4.
Although the Russell 2000 doesn't include any ADRs, traders said weakness in those issues helped batter other equities.
But some small stocks had plenty of bad news of their own to pave the way for steep losses.
