Donnelly Corp. said it will begin construction of a $10 million plant next month in Newaygo, Mich., that will make exterior automotive mirror systems and door handles for Ford Motor Co.
Donnelly said the factory, which will begin production in October 1995, initially will employ between 75 and 125 workers but could employ 325 workers at full capacity.
