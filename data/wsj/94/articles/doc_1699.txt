The Pentagon's top policy official, Frank Wisner, will resign soon and be nominated to become ambassador to India, Clinton administration officials said.
The move is significant for several reasons.
Most notably, the administration already had picked someone to be its envoy to India, former New York Rep. Stephen Solarz.
Mr. Solarz, former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, said he agreed to withdraw his name after meeting Wednesday with Vice President Al Gore.
The White House decided not to pursue Mr. Solarz's nomination after receiving a Federal Bureau of Investigation report on the ex-congressmen's effort to help a Hong Kong businessman extend a visa to the U.S.
The businessman was suspected of having connections to organized crime in Hong Kong, but Mr. Solarz apparently was unaware of that.
Mr. Solarz said last night that the FBI report exonerated him of wrongdoing.
But it was clear that given the administration's current Whitewater troubles, it didn't relish the prospect of a messy nomination fight in the Senate.
