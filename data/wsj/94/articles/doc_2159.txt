Taiwan's overseas investment approved by the government totaled $85.6 million (U.S.) in the first two months of this year, up 122% from $38.5 million a year earlier, the Investment Commission reported.
The agency attributed the increase in the period mainly to expanding investment in the U.S., which leaped 73%.
