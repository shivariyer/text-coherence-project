Atlantic Richfield Co.'s Vastar Resources Inc. unit said it filed with the Security and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of as many as 17.25 million shares, or 17.7% of stock outstanding.
Recently created Vastar operates Arco's major natural-gas properties in the contiguous 48 states as well as some related oil operations.
Its assets don't include Arco's vast Alaskan operations.
But, in its own right, Vastar would rank among the larger U.S. natural-gas producers.
In the SEC filing, Houston-based Vastar said that, at a maximum anticipated price of $30 a share, the IPO may raise as much as $517.5 million.
The actual sale price is likely to be lower.
Proceeds from the sale would go to Arco, which would retain an 82.3% stake in Vastar, assuming all stock over-allotments are sold.
Vastar is the largest of four units created last fall by Arco to operate its oil and gas holdings in the continguous 48 states.
The other units hold the company's California and Midwestern oil-production interests.
Vastar is believed to have the greatest growth prospects if markets for natural gas take off.
Vastar said in its filing that its proved reserves total 2.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 99 million barrels of crude oil, natural-gas condensates and liquids.
In the first nine months of last year, the company's daily natural-gas production averaged 701 million cubic feet and 44,900 barrels of petroleum liquids.
In 1992, had Vastar been in existence, its operations would have produced about $1.13 billion in revenue and net income of $32 million.
ATLANTIC RICHFIELD Co.'s Vastar Resources Inc. unit will receive the proceeds from a proposed initial public offering of as much as 17.7% of Vastar stock outstanding.
An article yesterday incorrectly stated that Arco would receive the proceeds.
