U.K. drug company Zeneca PLC said business in the second half of 1993 was better than a year earlier.
It also said it expects to report profit for the second half "ahead of the comparable period in 1992, although slightly lower than the first half of 1993."
Zeneca, which was spun off by Imperial Chemical Industries PLC at the start of 1993, said overall drug sales were higher in 1993 than in 1992.
Uncertainties in many health-care markets remain, and the favorable impact of exchange rates has "decreased substantially" compared with the first half of 1993, the company cautioned.
Zeneca said it expects its agrochemicals business to break even in the second half.
The division had a loss in the second half of 1992.
One factor contributing to pressure on profit margins was the impact of European Union farming policy, the company said.
