Chevron Corp. said it started "exclusive negotiations" with Clark Refining & Marketing Inc. for the sale of Chevron's Port Arthur, Texas, refinery.
Terms of the prospective sale weren't disclosed.
Chevron said its Chevron U.S.A. Products Co. unit will continue to own and operate a petrochemical plant that is closely integrated with the 177,000 barrel-per-day refinery.
Depending on successful conclusion of negotiations, completion of the sale is expected sometime in the fourth quarter, Chevron said.
Clark Refining is a St. Louis-based unit of Toronto-based Horsham Corp., which also has investments in gold mining and real estate.
Chevron announced last May that it planned to sell the refinery as part of a broad plan to prune nearly one-third of its domestic refining and marketing capacity and took a $550 million charge at the time related all of its disposals and closures.
