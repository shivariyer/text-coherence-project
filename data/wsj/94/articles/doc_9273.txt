Moody's Investor Service Inc. said it downgraded the nation's long-term debt rating because of deterioration of Turkey's public finances.
The downgrade to Ba-1 from Baa-3 affects $8.5 billion in debt securities.
Moody's said that it expects Turkey's high fiscal deficits to persist, despite the government's efforts to increase revenue.
"Spending pressures are likely to remain strong, and the government may have to move cautiously so as not to cause excessive social disruption," the rating agency said.
Turkey's strong domestic demand, and the decline in the country's trade barriers through 1995 are likely to keep the current-account deficit higher than in recent years, the company said.
But the removal of trade barriers, Moody's said, "will require significant economic restructuring in ensuing years."
