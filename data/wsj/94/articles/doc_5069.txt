Komag Inc. said it had a fiscal fourth-quarter loss following a $35.4 million charge to cover a restructuring of Dastek Inc., a joint venture with Japan's Asahi Glass Co.
For the quarter ended Jan. 2, the Milpitas, Calif., company reported a loss of $29.7 million, or $1.35 a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $4.4 million, or 20 cents a share.
Sales declined 5.3% to $91.2 million from $96.3 million.
The year-earlier period was a week longer than the latest quarter.
Komag makes thin-film components for disk drives.
Dastek, which makes recording heads used in disk drives, will exit from the market for inductive thin-film heads, Komag said.
As a result of the restructuring charge, Komag said it is currently in violation of certain bank-debt covenants.
It expects to obtain necessary waivers from lenders within weeks.
For the 52 weeks, Komag had a loss of $9.9 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with profit of $16.9 million, or 79 cents a share, in the 53 weeks a year earlier.
Sales rose 18% to $385.4 million.
