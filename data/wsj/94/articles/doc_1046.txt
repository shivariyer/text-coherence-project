Broderbund Software Inc., citing increased demand for its CD-ROM titles, said fiscal second-quarter net income jumped 21% on a 4% gain in revenue.
The Novato, Calif., software concern's net for the period ended Feb. 28 was $4.5 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $3.7 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue was $25.4 million, up from $24.4 million.
The results beat analysts' consensus estimates of 42 cents a share.
Montgomery Securities analyst Betty Lyter attributed the improvement to a slightly different product mix.
Broderbund's year-ago-quarter included two months of revenue from a lower profit margin software product for Maxis Software, while this year's second quarter didn't.
Electronic Arts Inc., San Mateo, Calif., agreed in February to buy Broderbund in a stock swap valued at $400 million.
