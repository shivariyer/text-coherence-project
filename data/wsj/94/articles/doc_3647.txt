Eli Lilly & Co. received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market its Prozac drug to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Prozac is already the pharmaceutical company's biggest product, with 1993 sales estimated at about $1.2 billion.
The drug was cleared by the FDA in 1987 for treating severe depression; the FDA's latest action makes Prozac the only product that can be marketed in the U.S. for both clinical depression and what is known as "OCD."
The only drug that has thus far had FDA approval as a treatment for OCD is Ciba-Geigy's Anafranil.
OCD affects some five million Americans.
People with the disorder suffer from uncontrollable ideas or impulses that they usually know are irrational.
Sufferers seek to relieve their distress through some form of ritualistic behavior.
Some people with OCD are so preoccupied by their behavior that it's difficult for them to function normally.
James Broatch, executive director of the nonprofit OC Foundation, in Milford, Conn., noted that Prozac is already being used to treat OCD; once a drug has received FDA marketing clearance, doctors are free to prescribe it for all ailments where they consider it potentially beneficial.
SmithKline Beecham's Paxil anti-depressant and Pfizer Inc.'s Zoloft are also currently prescribed for the disorder, he said.
