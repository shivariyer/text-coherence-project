Just six weeks after Brendan D. Boyle was named director of mutual-fund sales and marketing for Smith Barney Shearson Inc., he accepted nearly the same job at Prudential Mutual Fund Management Co.
Mr. Boyle, 39 years old, was appointed yesterday as executive vice president and director of marketing of Prudential Mutual Funds Management Co., a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America's brokerage arm, Prudential Securities.
Mr. Boyle succeeds Jessica Bibliowicz, who joined Smith Barney in January as executive vice president for sales and marketing of mutual funds, insurance and annuities.
Ms. Bibliowicz was Mr. Boyle's boss at Smith Barney.
"I can't tell you how happy I am," said Richard Redeker, president and chief executive of Prudential Mutual Funds, referring to Mr. Boyle's joining the firm.
"He saw a tremendous opportunity here at Prudential.
We will put the other issues behind us and we will be one of the major winners in the industry."
Prudential has been embroiled in lawsuits stemming from soured limited partnerships sold to investors in the 1980s.
Mr. Boyle will begin his new job within two weeks.
He will direct all marketing efforts for Prudential's mutual funds and outside funds sold by Prudential brokers.
Mr. Redeker said Mr. Boyle also will be responsible for marketing upcoming funds and different fund pricing structures in the works.
At Smith Barney, a unit of Travelers Inc., Mr. Boyle oversaw sales of that brokerage firm's 82 proprietary mutual funds, which have combined assets of $55 billion.
Smith Barney said it hadn't named a successor yet, but had no further comment.
