Walt Disney Co. plans to build a Mediterranean style time-share resort near Newport Beach, in the rolling hills above one of the last stretches of undeveloped ocean-view land in Southern California.
Disney said it acquired 35 acres of property at Newport Coast, a residential and resort community being developed by the Irvine Co., a major Orange County real-estate developer.
Disney expects to acquire another 10 acres at the site in about a year and has an option to acquire an additional 25 acres.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Real-estate experts in the area said that property in the Newport Coast development is generally selling in the range of $1 million an acre.
However, analysts said Disney likely got a better deal.
Disney said that, pending government approvals, the resort will be part of the Disney Vacation Club, one of the Burbank, Calif.-based entertainment concern's fastest-growing businesses.
Plans call for the Newport Coast complex, scheduled to open in 1997, to include 650 vacation villas as well as restaurants and retail shops.
