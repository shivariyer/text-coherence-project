Italian state-owned holding company Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale announced it would sell 500 million shares in Banca Commerciale Italiana.
The price will be announced closer to the time of flotation on Feb. 28, IRI said.
It is expected the sell-off will raise about 2.4 trillion lire ($1.41 billion) for IRI, before fees.
IRI said 40% of the offering, or about 200 million shares, will go to Italian retail investors with a corresponding number allotted to institutions.
It also will offer 40 million shares to BCI employees, and 40 million shares will go toward an overallottment option if the offer is oversubscribed.
The rest will go in a bonus-share option worth one share for every 10 held if shareholders retain their stock for at least three years.
The BCI sale had been brought forward after a successful sell-off last month of Credito Italiano, another Italian retail bank following strong domestic demand.
A single shareholding in BCI will be limited to 1% of the bank, or 10.5 million shares, while institutions can take as much as 2% of the issue.
IRI, Italy's largest employer, currently owns 45.9% of BCI while the rest is floated on the Milan stock exchange.
BCI shares closed at 4,775 lire, off 65 lire.
