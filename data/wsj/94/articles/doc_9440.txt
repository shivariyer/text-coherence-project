Betz Laboratories Inc. said it will take a restructuring charge of $12.1 million, or 24 cents a share, against fourth-quarter earnings.
The Trevose, Pa., engineered programs and specialty-chemical products company said the charge stems from moves to reduce operating costs over the long term, including work-force cuts, shedding unproductive assets, and reorganization.
Net income in 1992's fourth quarter was $20.1 million, or 67 cents a share, on revenue of $172.6 million.
R. Dale Voncanon, vice president, finance, said the bulk of the savings would come through sales of underused warehouse space in the Philadelphia area and through centralization of some administrative functions currently duplicated in the company's units.
Betz doesn't plan to close any plants, and work-force reductions will be "less than 5%" of the company's 4,200 employees world-wide, Mr. Voncanon said.
In December, the company said sales and earnings for 1993 would fall short of 1992's results.
Last year was the first time since 1965 that the company had a sales downturn.
