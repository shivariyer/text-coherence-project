U.S. Bancorp said it reached a revised agreement to acquire Johnstown Savings Bank in a cash and stock deal.
Under a complex formula, USBancorp in Johnstown, Pa., said it will pay $10.13 in cash and a fraction of its common stock for each Johnstown Savings' share.
The fraction will be based on a formula relating to the average closing price of USBancorp's stock 10 days before the transaction closes.
Based on the average closing price over the past 10 days, the transaction's value would be $43.6 million, or $22.48 a share.
Johnstown Savings, which has $355 million in assets, can terminate the agreement if the average closing price of USBancorp in the 10 days before the closing is less than $20.50 a share.
Johnstown also can solicit other bids until Feb. 17.
USBancorp has $1.2 billion in assets.
