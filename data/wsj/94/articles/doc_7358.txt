British Airways PLC said it will pay Virgin Atlantic Airways #2.65 million ($4 million) to settle a dispute over aircraft maintenance contracts.
The payout is the latest in a string of claims, counterclaims and settlement attempts involving the two feuding British airlines.
About a year ago, a tentative agreement between the two fell apart when Virgin claimed that British Airways was reneging on certain terms and conditions.
Virgin said British Airways had offered it #9 million as a settlement but had demanded several conditions for the payment.
British Airways, which then strongly denied any money was on the table, admitted Friday that it had indeed offered #9 million.
The settlement doesn't interfere with Virgin's antitrust suit against British Airways in the U.S.
The case opens on March 25; Virgin is seeking damages of $325 million.
The maintenance dispute arose in 1988 after British Airways refused to compensate Virgin for damage caused to Virgin aircraft under maintenance.
British Airways said the #2.65 million payout was considerably less than the #6 million that Virgin had demanded.
But Will Whitehorn, a Virgin Atlantic spokesman, said the company had only asked for #3 million to settle.
"It is a total and utter lie that we demanded #6 million," he said.
British Airways is also paying all legal costs Virgin incurred in this affair.
