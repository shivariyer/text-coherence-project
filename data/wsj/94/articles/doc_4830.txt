A buoyant bond market rally reversed course and ended in a rout amid vacillating views on inflation.
Stocks followed bonds lower, and the dollar was mixed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.63 points to 3922.64.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 2.45 to 470.34, and the Nasdaq Composite Index sank 2.38 to 790.24.
The bond market sell-off pushed the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond above 6.5% for the first time since August 1993.
Bond prices swung from a gain of nearly 7/8 point and a yield of 6.39% to a loss of more than a point.
The initial bond market rally was sparked by a better-than-expected report on consumer prices.
The Labor Department said such prices were unchanged in January, the first time the figure has showed no change since August 1989.
Analysts were expecting a rise of 0.3%.
But the mood changed after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia released its February survey of business activity in its region.
The data showed strength in manufacturing and a pickup in prices, which together were enough to sour bond traders' views on the inflation outlook.
Bond prices tumbled.
"Suddenly, everything is back on the watch list: inflation and a potential Fed tightening," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Co.
Wayne F. Wong, senior fixed-income strategist at Marinvest, a subsidiary of Hongkong & Shanghai Bank, said comments by Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, also spooked bond traders.
Although Ms. Tyson said inflation remains under control, traders focused on her remark that strong December trade data released yesterday may cause an upward revision in fourth-quarter gross domestic product.
The move above a 6.5% yield on the 30-year bond is significant because it sets the groundwork for a push to 6.75%, the level that many analysts now expect by year end, Gruntal's Mr. Battipaglia said.
"We thought the move up would be a gradual process," he said.
"But many traders are coming to the conclusion that the cycle of easing rates is over."
The bond market's fickle trading day underscores traders' jittery nerves since the Fed tightened monetary policy on Feb. 4.
Many analysts said that they continue to expect a further small boost in short-term interest rates soon.
Stocks rode the tail winds of higher bond prices early in the day and suffered as bond prices tumbled.
The industrial average climbed 20 points before computer-guided program selling wiped out the gains.
"Although we speak of a transition to an earnings-driven stock market, stocks still very much dance to the drumbeat of interest rates," Mr. Battipaglia said.
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index lost 0.23 to 116.16.
Stock prices fell.
Volume totaled 338.9 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,251 issues fell and 882 rose.
Bond prices plunged.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue lost more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.54%.
The dollar was mixed.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.7233 marks and 104.10 yen compared with 1.7233 marks and 103.80 yen Wednesday.
