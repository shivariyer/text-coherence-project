Nalco Chemical Co. and Exxon Corp.'s chemical unit said they tentatively agreed to form an energy-chemicals joint venture.
The venture will include Nalco's U.S. petroleum-chemicals division, some segments of Nalco's international petroleum-chemicals business, and Exxon Chemical Co.'s energy-chemicals business.
Nalco is based in Naperville, Ill.; Exxon is based in New York.
The venture, to be named Nalco/Exxon Energy Chemicals, is slated to begin operation by the middle of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and a definitive agreement.
The venture will make chemicals used in oil exploration and production.
In a related move, Nalco said it signed a letter of intent to sell its Freeport, Texas, plant and its automotive paint spray-booth business to Pittsburgh-based PPG Industries Inc.
