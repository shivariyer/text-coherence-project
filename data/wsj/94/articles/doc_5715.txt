All Nippon Airways, Japan's second-largest airline, said it expects flat earnings for the fiscal year ending March 31 but sees a modest recovery next year.
"The total number of Japanese traveling abroad is increasing," said Koji Yamashita, vice president of international passenger marketing and sales at All Nippon.
But passengers are spending less on air fares by choosing cheap tickets whenever possible, Mr. Yamashita said in an interview.
The move toward discount air fares probably will continue even if Japan's slumping economy recovers, because the downturn has brought on a wave of thriftiness in Japan that won't disappear, he said.
ANA, which announced a restructuring program in an effort to trim costs earlier this week, will also try to boost sales through marketing efforts, Mr. Yamashita said.
"Our basic strategy is to align with other carriers," he said.
ANA is negotiating with other international airlines to cooperate in frequent flyer mileage-credit programs and expects to announce new tie-ups in the "near future," Mr. Yamashita said.
For the fiscal year that ended March 31, 1993, ANA's pretax profit fell 34% to 13.3 billion yen ($122.8 million) from 20.1 billion yen the year earlier.
