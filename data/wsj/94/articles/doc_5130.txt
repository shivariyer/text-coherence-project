Western German wholesale prices rose 0.6% in January from December and were unchanged from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office reported.
January's wholesale prices were expected to climb 0.4% in January but to be down 0.2% from a year earlier, according to a survey of 11 economists.
The statistics office said the relatively strong month-on-month increase in the price index is due mainly to the increase in the oil tax Jan. 1.
Excluding petroleum products, the overall index showed a month-on-month climb of 0.1%.
