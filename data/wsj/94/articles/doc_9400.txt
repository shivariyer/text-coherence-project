A bankers meeting set for this morning could decide whether Metallgesellschaft AG's next announcement is a bankruptcy declaration.
Yesterday, more than 100 bank creditors faxed their decisions on the company's proposed 3.4-billion-mark ($1.95 billion) financial rescue package for the metals, engineering and trading group.
But the plan was in jeopardy as a handful of holdouts demanded revisions before giving approval.
The responses are to be assessed by a steering committee of leading bank creditors this morning, according to a spokesman for Deutsche Bank AG, which heads the panel.
An announcement of the outcome is expected later today.
"There will be no more negotiations . . . .
It is a package that must be taken as a whole," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman.
If some banks reject the plan, "then they must live with the stigma of bankrupting Metallgesellschaft," he said.
The company's restructuring plan asks banks to convert 1.3 billion marks in credits into convertible profit-sharing equity, and extend a new 700-million-mark credit line.
The plan also calls for a new share offering valued at 1.4 billion marks.
Metallgesellschaft has declared that it would enter liquidation proceedings if the plan didn't go through.
The company's big shareholders have conditioned their participation in the new share offering on the banks' accepting the credit-restructuring part of the package.
The last-minute uncertainty erased much of the recent gains for Metallgesellschaft's battered stock price on the Frankfurt stock exchange, where it fell 10 marks to 226 marks yesterday.
The most outspoken opponent of the plan, Norddeutsche Landesbank of Hanover, one of the company's big German creditors, said it would reject the plan unless Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank AG assumed a bigger share of the burden, among other demands.
