Euro Disney faces more red ink for fiscal 1994, even if creditor banks and parent Walt Disney Co. agree on a financial rescue package for the struggling amusement park.
In the report to be presented at today's annual stockholders meeting, Euro Disney Chairman Philippe Bourguignon stated that the park's deficit will continue for the last half of this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
Euro Disney is working against a March 31 deadline to reach a restructuring plan with its banks and Walt Disney for its 21 billion franc ($3.67 billion) debt.
The park lost 5.3 billion francs in the year ended Sept. 30, 1993.
"If the restructuring is carried out, these measures ought to improve the financial situation of the group," Mr. Bourguignon wrote.
"But even so, the group should find itself in a deficit situation for the first and second halves of fiscal year 1994."
The letter contained no surprises, since no cure is expected to put the theme park quickly back on its feet.
Mr. Bourguignon said in the message that the "deeply unbalanced financial structure of Euro Disney has become intolerable to the point of endangering the existence of the enterprise."
The future of the park depends almost entirely on the negotiations with the 63 banks and Walt Disney, which owns 49% of the park's operating company, Euro Disney SCA, Mr. Bourguignon said.
Attendance has been roughly in line with estimates since Euro Disney opened in April 1992, but hotels have been unfilled and sales of food and souvenirs have been disappointing.
The collapse of the Paris real-estate market has worsened matters, since Euro Disney had expected to develop vast tracts of land around the amusement park at Marne-la-Vallee, outside Paris.
