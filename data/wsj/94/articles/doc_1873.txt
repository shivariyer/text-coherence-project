A Fleet Financial Group Inc. unit agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging that hundreds of black homeowners in Georgia were victims of discrimination because their mortgage interest rates were much higher than those of white borrowers.
The loans were originated by a group of small mortgage brokers, then sold to Fleet Finance Inc., a unit of Fleet, Providence, R.I.
The agreement is the latest in a series of court settlements and other initiatives by Fleet to address charges by black people and low-income borrowers that the bank had violated fair-lending rules.
The proposed settlement, which requires state court approval, offers certain black borrowers lowered interest rates in some cases, and cash payments and forgiveness of some debt in others.
The value of the settlement isn't spelled out in the agreement approved by a Superior Court judge here, and attorneys said that the pact stipulated that neither side could comment.
Fleet admits no wrongdoing in the settlement.
Class members in the case have until June 17 to file objections, and a July 18 Superior Court hearing was set to assess the settlement's fairness.
