Plains Resources Inc., Houston, said credit available to it increased to $55 million from $40 million.
The oil-and-gas company said an amended agreement with creditor Internationale Nederlanden (U.S.) Capital Corp., a unit of Amsterdam-based Internationale Nederlanden Groep, provides for initial availability of $50 million.
Plains said it borrowed $35.6 million as of Dec. 31.
Phil Kramer, vice president and chief financial officer, said the credit increase will enable the company to implement its 1994 capital program of $15 million to $20 million even if crude-oil prices remain at their current level.
