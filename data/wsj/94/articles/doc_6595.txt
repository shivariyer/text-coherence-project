The Canadian government slowed the pace of its monthly gold sales in January, easing pressure on gold prices.
The Finance Department said yesterday that the government sold 117,000 ounces of gold from its official monetary reserves last month, down from a 1993 monthly average of 324,000 ounces.
Canada is the only country that regularly sells gold from its reserves, gold analysts say.
Other countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, have made substantial gold sales, but not on a regular and sustained basis like Canada.
The Canadian government received an average of $387.18 an ounce for the gold it sold in January.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold was quoted late yesterday for February delivery at $387.30 an ounce.
The January sale reduced Canada's gold holding to 5.9 million ounces, or about a quarter of the gold stock it held when it started the regular sales 14 years ago.
The U.S. holds 261.8 million ounces.
Gold producers have strongly criticized the Canadian sales.
But Canadian officials said Canada's gold sales have been highly profitable and have increased the liquidity of the country's reserves.
