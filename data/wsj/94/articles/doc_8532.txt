The German unit of Procter & Gamble Co. revised its plan to acquire German household paper group VP-Schickedanz AG after the European Union Commission said an initial proposal could pose competition problems in the feminine-protection products market.
A revised proposal submitted by Procter & Gamble GmbH to EU competition authorities calls for the simultaneous divestment of VPS's diaper business and its feminine-hygiene business associated with its Blumia, Femina and Tampona brands, and its private-label activity.
The initial plan submitted last month called only for divestment of the diaper business of VPS, a unit of Gustav & Grete Schickedanz Holding KGaA.
The deal for the Cincinnati consumer products company to acquire all VPS shares was being considered under the first stage of the EU's merger-investigation process, and the commission hadn't yet indicated whether it would launch a more detailed probe.
But concerns were expressed to P&G, sources said, that the acquisition would grant it too large a share in the feminine-products sector, so P&G withdrew its initial notification and submitted the revised proposal this week.
"The commission felt that they weren't completely confident that this wouldn't restrict competition, so we have made a significant change in the proposal," said a P&G spokesman in Brussels.
Other principal players in Europe's feminine-protection market include Scott Paper Co., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Johnson & Johnson.
Although several mergers have been approved with modifications during the initial stage of an EU investigation, the withdrawal and resubmission of a revised proposal is rare.
The commission now will examine the reformulated deal anew.
