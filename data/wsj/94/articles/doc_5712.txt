American Express Co. is taking a close look at offering charge cards tied to major manufacturers and retailers and that offer discounts to users.
Kenneth I. Chenault, head of the company's domestic credit and charge-card division, told securities analysts yesterday that the topic of so-called co-branded cards as well as other strategic alliances is a serious one at the big charge-card and travel company.
"We're not just planning, we're working on them now," he said.
Although American Express offers an affinity card that awards frequent-flier miles, and has a small co-branded card with American Telephone & Telegraph Co., it has so far avoided the rush to launch major co-branded products.
With such cards, issuers join up with major product manufacturers to jointly sponsor cards that provide card-holders with discounts based on their card usage.
