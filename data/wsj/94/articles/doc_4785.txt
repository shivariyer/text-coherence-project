General Motors Corp., continuing its efficiency drive, agreed to sell five of its axle, propeller shaft and forge manufacturing plants to American Axle & Manufacturing Inc. effective Feb. 28.
Terms weren't disclosed.
GM last year announced its intention to sell its axle, shaft and forge business.
The sale is part of the Detroit-based company's strategy to streamline its Automotive Components Group Worldwide, once one of GM's worst-performing business units.
"We're now in a position to concentrate on growing our core businesses: steering systems and components and front-drive axles," said Donald L. Runkle, vice president and general manager of GM's Saginaw division.
The auto maker also has announced it will sell three plants from its Delco Remy division that make starter motors.
