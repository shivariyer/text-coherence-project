Tidewater Inc. said it will buy back 60,000 shares of its common stock commission-free from holders of fewer than 100 shares.
The company said it will pay a per-share price determined by the average closing market price for the stock from Feb. 1 through March 4, 1994, inclusive.
Shareholders Communications Corp. will manage the program, which is open to holders of record Feb. 1 and expires March 4.
A spokeswoman for Tidewater, an owner and operator of vessels that service the oil industry, said the program provides an inexpensive way for small shareholders to sell their stock and saves the company money associated with servicing their accounts.
