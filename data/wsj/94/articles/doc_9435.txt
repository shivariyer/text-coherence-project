National Intergroup Inc. said it sold nearly 3.4 million shares of National Steel Corp. for $42.8 million in a series of privately negotiated transactions.
A National Intergroup spokesman said the Dallas holding company has planned for some time to divest itself of the last vestiges of its original business.
By selling the 11% stake in National Steel, which is now owned by Japan's NKK Corp., National Intergroup is left with just 70,000 common and 10,000 preferred shares in the steel maker, the spokesman said.
He said that the company will put $10 million of the proceeds into escrow to cover a potential environmental liability.
The company hasn't said what it will do with the rest of the proceeds, he added.
