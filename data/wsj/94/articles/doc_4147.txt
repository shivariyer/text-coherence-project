British Gas PLC reported a 1993 fourth-quarter loss of #694 million ($1.03 billion), after a #1.65 billion restructuring charge, and said it will cut 25,000 jobs over the next few years, or 5,000 more than previously planned.
The company said tighter margins stemming from increased competition and rate regulation resulted in "downward pressure on profits," which is expected to continue this year.
A year earlier, British Gas posted a profit of #234 million.
Chairman Richard Giordan, explaining the plan to reduce staffing by more than a third, said, "We are seizing this opportunity to reduce radically our cost of doing business, so that we can succeed in the more competitive gas markets of the future."
The company currently has about 70,000 employees.
British Gas's shares closed at 328 pence ($4.85), down 12 pence.
The restructuring charge, which was higher than analysts expected, will cover the costs of the job reductions and the company's plans to reorganize its domestic gas business into five separate businesses.
The reorganization stems in part from a British regulators' decision to end the company's monopoly on sales to domestic customers in 1996.
British Gas agreed with regulators last year to limit rises in the prices it charges its domestic and smaller business customers to the annual rate of retail price inflation less five percentage points.
From April, however, this will be reduced to the inflation rate less four percentage points in an attempt to compensate British Gas for the loss of income from increased competition.
The company said easing the price formula "brings a welcome measure of relief," but added that "margins will remain under pressure in the future."
The company's fourth-quarter profit before exceptional restructuring charge and a #33 million environmental charge dropped marginally to #489 million from #490 million in the 1992 fourth quarter.
Revenue declined to #3.30 billion from #3.33 billion.
For all of 1993, the company reported a #285 million net income, compared with #681 million in 1992.
Profit before the charges dropped to #898 million from #937 million the year before, while revenue rose to #10.39 billion from #10.25 billion.
Its total dividend paid last year was increased to 14.5 pence a share from 14.2 pence in 1992.
