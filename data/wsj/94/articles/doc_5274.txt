Multimedia Inc., a media company based in Greenville, S.C., said it will invest $150 million in upgrading technology for its cable-television operations.
The investment will cover new fiber lines, which will enable the company to boost the number of channels offered, and interactive boxes to offer subscribers more video services, such as programs on demand, the company said.
The company also said its largest daily newspapers, in Greenville, S.C., and Montgomery, Ala., are joining a group with BellSouth Corp. and Cox Enterprises Inc. to market classified and phone-book advertising.
