Prosecutors raided the home of a former Japanese cabinet minister Wednesday, as a widening influence-peddling scandal threatened its highest-ranking target yet.
Japanese news broadcasts showed prosecutors filing into the home of Kishiro Nakamura, a member of parliament and former construction minister.
The search is part of an investigation into a prolonged scandal that has brought down several regional politicians and dozens of executives from Japan's top construction companies.
At issue are allegations that politicians used their influence to help contractors win public-works bids.
With the probe of Mr. Nakamura, the focus of the scandal has shifted to the national seat of politics in Tokyo.
But it is still unclear whether the scandal will spread to other members of parliament, or to leaders of the ruling coalition government.
For days, Japanese newspapers have carried banner headlines about Mr. Nakamura's failure to cooperate with prosecutors' repeated requests that he submit to questioning.
Many analysts think it is only a matter of time before the authorities arrest Mr. Nakamura, who hasn't been formally charged.
Prosecutors declined to comment on news accounts of the allegations against Mr. Nakamura.
Mr. Nakamura and his lawyers weren't available to comment.
Mr. Nakamura is protected from arrest by a rule that grants lawmakers immunity while parliament is in session.
Prosecutors have asked the government to waive the immunity for the first time in 27 years.
The lower house of parliament is expected to lift Mr. Nakamura's protection by a majority vote as early as Thursday, allowing prosecutors to arrest him.
The Wednesday raid against Mr. Nakamura marks the first high-profile move against a national lawmaker since Mr. Nakamura's Liberal Democratic Party lost power to a coalition of opposition parties last year after four decades of rule.
A prime reason for the fall was the Liberal Democrats' failure to reform Japanese politics after a series of scandals.
