Trying to toughen economic sanctions against Libya, the U.S. Treasury helped force the resignation of Libyan native Abdulla Saudi as chief executive of Arab Banking Corp., one of the largest banks in the Arab world.
Officials of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control said they also anticipate that the Libyan central bank's 25% stake in the Bahrain-based bank will be reduced, and Libya's influence over it will be limited.
R. Richard Newcomb, director of the Treasury office, said the Treasury isn't necessarily seeking to topple the institution, but rather to restructure it and "see that the Libyan control is neutralized."
He added that the U.S. is pursuing similar agreements with other Libyan-influenced institutions.
Mr. Saudi, who founded the bank in 1980, said this week that he would resign May 1, explaining only that his move was "owing to external circumstances" and was necessary to safeguard the future of the bank.
Although located in Bahrain, the bank isn't permitted to do business there.
The governments of Abu Dhabi and Kuwait also own 25% stakes; the remaining 25% is publicly held.
The bank reported assets totaling $18.4 billion at the end of last year.
Bahrain Finance Minister Ibrahim Abdul Karim and Bahrain Monetary Agency Governor Adbulla Saif visited Washington in early February to negotiate an arrangement with the U.S.
Their visit led the Treasury to lift a freeze on the assets of Arab Financial Services, an affiliate of the bank.
The U.S. was threatening to freeze the assets of Arab Banking Corp. unless Libya's influence was curtailed significantly.
The tougher U.S. stance follows tighter United Nations sanctions that came into force Dec. 1.
They include a world-wide freeze on selected funds and financial resources of Libyan government agencies, companies and individuals.
