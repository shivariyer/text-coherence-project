Toy maker Mattel Inc. said it agreed to acquire Kransco, the producer of Hula Hoops, Frisbees and children's ride-on electric cars, for cash.
The amount wasn't disclosed.
Closely held Kransco last year had revenue of $175 million.
The San Francisco-based company has 1,200 employees and markets the Hula Hoop and Frisbee products under the "Wham-O" name.
Its largest revenue producer is the "Power Wheels" line of children's ride-on cars, a Mattel spokesman said.
Mattel, based in El Segundo, Calif., last year had revenue of $2.7 billion.
The companies said that, subject to regulatory approval, they expect to complete the transaction by the end of May.
