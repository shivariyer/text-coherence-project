Thyssen Stahl, the steelmaking division of Thyssen AG, said it would cut a further 1,250 jobs in 1994, citing 1993 fourth-quarter losses.
The company announced previously that it would cut 10,000 of a total of 35,000 jobs in its steel operations.
Thyssen Stahl blamed "catastrophic losses in the last quarter of 1993" and the decision by the European Union to allow continued subsidies to state steel companies for the decision to slash jobs.
A spokesman for Thyssen Stahl wouldn't supply specific loss figures for the fourth quarter or the year.
The company said its dire fiscal situation would prevent it from easing the blow from the layoffs through voluntary early retirement programs.
"We just don't have the money anymore," the spokesman said.
However, he added that the company was in talks with the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia on what could be done for the steelworkers who lose their jobs.
Thyssen AG's largest single area is steel, but it also has extensive operations in trading and services, stamping and casting, machine- elevator- and escalator-building, and other engineering products.
