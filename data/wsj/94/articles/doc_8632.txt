Waiting around for your prescription to be filled?
How about a candy bar or a new shade of lipstick?
Drugstore shoppers spend 40% more on candy than they do on analgesics, according to Information Resources Inc.'s InfoScan service.
They also spend 45% more on cosmetics than they do on cold or flu remedies.
Purchases of such impulse items are high in drugstores, according to Hemant K. Shah, a drug analyst with HKS & Co. and a former pharmacist, because shoppers often wait 30 minutes for their prescription.
"Candy is an all-occasion purchase," Mr. Shah says.
"You don't need to wait until you have a headache."
Information Resources ranked product categories in U.S. drugstores by total dollar sales during the 52 weeks ended Dec. 5, compared with the year-earlier period.
Together, the top 10 categories account for 37.2% of over-the-counter drug and general merchandise sales.
Information Resources doesn't track prescription drug sales, which account for 40% to 50% of total store revenue.
Although the roster of top-selling over-the-counter drug and general merchandise categories changes little from year to year, a few shifts are notable.
Sales of vitamins soared 10.6% compared with the previous year, after several medical studies linked certain vitamins to lower incidence of cancer and other diseases.
Sales of home diagnostic kits and other first-aid products jumped 11.1%, thanks to improving technology and Americans' growing desire to gain more control of their own health care.
Some of the declines reflect a shift in shopping habits.
Bargain-hunting consumers are buying more cosmetics at deep-discount drugstores and mass merchandisers.
Hurting drugstore sales of contact lens solutions: The growing popularity of disposable lenses and fierce price competition from private-label rivals.
