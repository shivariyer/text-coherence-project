Anheuser-Busch Cos. said fourth-quarter earnings rose 3.2% on higher beer sales, partly reflecting the rollout of its Budweiser Ice Draft beer.
The nation's largest brewer said it would seek to raise prices on its line of Budweiser premium beers this year, although at rates below the consumer price index.
Such a move would help offset lower prices it has been forced to charge in California, where an intense beer price war continues.
For the quarter Anheuser reported earnings of $166.8 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with $161.6 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 4.7% to $2.85 billion from $2.73 billion.
There were 10.9 million fewer common shares outstanding in the latest period.
Full-year earnings fell 35% to $594.5 million, or $2.17 a share, from $917.5 million, or $3.22 a share, in 1992.
The 1993 figures include a pretax restructuring charge of $565 million, equal to $1.26 a share, while the prior-year figures include an accounting charge of $76.7 million, or 26 cents a share.
Sales last year totaled $11.51 billion, up less than 1% from $11.39 billion in 1992.
Anheuser's theme-park business, Busch Entertainment Corp., reported record sales and earnings last year and was "a significant contributor" to overall results, the company said.
The brewer said it held onto its 44.3% share of the U.S. beer market last year, as it sold 87.3 million barrels, up 460,000 from 1992.
Current-quarter sales volume will be up at least 4% from a year earlier, reflecting Ice Draft's continued rollout and inventory stocking prior to the expiration of labor contracts, Anheuser said.
Last year's firstquarter sales were hurt by an unusually cold, wet spring.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Anheuser stock rose 12.5 cents, or 0.3%, to close at $48 a share.
