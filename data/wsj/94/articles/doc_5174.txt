International Airline Support Group Inc. dismissed its president and plans to cut 40 workers in a reorganization of the commercial-aircraft maintenance and airline-parts company.
The company also said its chief financial officer, William Simons, is resigning.
Mr. Simons, 40 years old, couldn't be reached immediately for comment.
Former President Dennis Young, 53, said the company "is on the right track."
It has "to get costs into control.
It makes sense to not have a high-paid executive on top."
Alexius Dyer III, 37, executive vice president, will succeed Mr. Young as president.
Kyle Kirkland, 31, a director and investment banker in Beverly Hills, Calif., will cover financial responsiblities at the company while it searches for a new chief financial officer.
In addition to cutting 31% of its 130 workers, the company said it is reducing senior-management salaries by one-fifth and cutting corporate expenses, saving $600,000 annually.
The company had a $1.3 million loss for its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30, compared with net income of $731,075 a year earlier.
The company's sales of jet parts have been running at $1 million a month, half the expected rate, in a soft market for Boeing 727 parts, Mr. Dyer said.
"We're trying to streamline the company to get costs in line with revenue and market conditions," he said.
