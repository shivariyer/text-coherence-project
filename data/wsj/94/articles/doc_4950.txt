Uranium Resources Inc. said that members of its senior management agreed to sell their shares of stock to affiliates of Concord, a closely held Denver conglomerate owned by Oren L. Benton.
The shareholders hold a majority interest in Dallas-based Uranium Resources.
The two companies earlier contemplated a strategic partnership, but that agreement was restructured as a stock purchase, the companies said.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The stock purchase is subject to renegotiation of Uranium Resources' bank credit agreement, which is expected to be completed in 30 days, the companies said.
Concord said it provided Uranium Resources with funds to meet its repayment obligations under that debt in December 1993, and intends to do so again in March 1994.
Concord's Energy Fuels division has been the largest uranium miner in the U.S. for the past decade.
Concord's Nuexco company is the largest uranium trader in the world.
