After four months of silence, Air France Chairman Christian Blanc put forward a restructuring plan that calls for subsidies of 20 billion French francs ($3.45 billion) and a 13% cut in employment.
Mr. Blanc, who took the controls at the airline in October, didn't stop there.
His greatly anticipated plan would also freeze salaries until 1996, reduce the number of planes in Air France's fleet and overhaul the organization of the company.
"At the point where we are, it must be said that we risk dying without knowing it," Mr. Blanc told journalists over a lunch in Paris.
He talked in almost mournful tones about the airline, noting that its 1993 loss exceeded 7.5 billion francs and its debt stands at about 37.5 billion francs.
The success of his blueprint for change now rests with the workers and the European Union commission in Brussels.
Immediately after his luncheon with the media, Mr. Blanc hosted a meeting with the 14 unions representing Air France's 40,000-strong work force.
Their acceptance of the plan is far from certain.
Already, the leader of one major union blasted the plan in comments to the French media and charged the government with "blackmail" for promising to provide fresh cash only after unions give their consent.
The pilots' union, meanwhile, said that while it accepts the plan in principle, it is concerned about proposed schedule changes and the fleet structure.
