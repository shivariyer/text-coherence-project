Small-company stocks ended broadly lower with investors stomping on the technology and oil groups.
Market watchers said profit-takers jumped into the fray, extending the weakness of last Thursday and Friday.
The recent better performance of smaller stocks compared with larger issues made them more susceptible to pullbacks, traders added.
The Russell 2000 Index, which charts the performance of small-capitalization issues traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, dropped 3.94, or 1.48%, to end at 262.51, but above its session low of 261.54.
On Nasdaq, the Composite Index fell 10.95, or 1.40%, to 772.50, although it had dropped to 767.24 at its weakest point.
Both indexes posted their biggest one-day losses since Feb. 4, when stocks slid sharply following a move by the Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
Traders said bottom-fishing in late trading pushed the indexes back above their worst levels of the day.
Declining Nasdaq issues beat advancers, 2,228 to 953, on Nasdaq National Market volume of 267,048,800 shares and total volume of 300,924,000.
On Friday, National Market volume was 242,052,300 shares and overall turnover registered 281,286,000.
Since Wednesday, the last time small-company issues closed higher, the Russell 2000 has fallen 7.69 points, or 2.85%, and the Nasdaq Composite has dropped 25 points, or 3.13%.
The previous week, the Russell 2000 climbed to three consecutive records, while the Nasdaq Composite reached two back-to-back highs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, hasn't closed at a record since Jan. 31.
The Dow Jones industrials closed at 3762.35 yesterday, losing only 12.38, or 0.33%, a narrower loss than the 45-point deficit reached in intraday trading on sell programs.
In the past three sessions, the Dow Jones industrials have given back 106.82, or 2.76%.
