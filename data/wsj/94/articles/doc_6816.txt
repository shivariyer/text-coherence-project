Tribune Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings climbed 38% on strengthened results at its broadcast and newspaper operations, lower interest outlays, and reduced exposure to the continuing weakness of its news-print subsidiary.
The big media concern reported net income of $58.1 million, or 80 cents a share, up from the year-ago period's $42 million, or 57 cents a share.
Revenue fell 6.9% to $513.9 million from $552.1 million a year ago.
The revenue downturn reflects the company's 1993 offering of a 51% voting stake in its Canada-based news-print unit, now known as Quno Corp.; Quno's results are reported under the equity method of accounting.
Tribune's newspaper operations, which include the Chicago Tribune and five other dailies, showed a 14% operating-profit increase, exclusive of a charge in the year-ago period to cover shutdown of a northern California daily.
Newspaper ad revenue grew 7%, helped by a solid 12% increase from classified ads.
The year-ago charge to close the Palo Alto, Calif., Peninsula Times-Tribune trimmed 12 cents a share from earnings, but was offset by a 12 cent gain that Tribune Co. -- which owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team -- reaped from its share of Major League Baseball expansion funds.
Tribune's broadcasting and entertainment group, which besides the Cubs team includes seven television stations, six radio stations, and a syndicated-programming business, saw operating profit, excluding the baseball-expansion fees, rise 41% on higher revenues at its TV and radio operations.
Tribune's portion of Quno's fourth-quarter loss cut 11 cents a share from the latest results; in the year-ago period, when Tribune was the unit's sole owner, Quno's loss reduced net by 13 cents a share.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Tribune shares rose $1.375 to $60.375 a share.
