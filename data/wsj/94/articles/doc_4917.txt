Lone Star Industries Inc. said federal bankruptcy court Judge Tina L. Brozman confirmed the company's plan of reorganization.
Lone Star added that at the confirmation hearing, the Equity Holders committee withdrew objections to confirmation of the plan.
Lone Star said it expects that distributions to the creditors and the stockholders would begin in March.
The construction-material company has been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since December 1990.
Under Lone Star's reorganization plan, the company intends to pay between 85% and 100% of about $570 million in unsecured claims on a pro rata basis.
But common shareholders would see their ownership cut to about 4.5%, while preferred shareholders will recover between 45% and 60% of their claims.
