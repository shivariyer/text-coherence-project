Today and tomorrow, Sen. John Chafee is bringing together a group of GOP senators, representatives and governors in a health care summit.
In a memo faxed yesterday to Republican leaders for use at the Annapolis conference, William Kristol of the Project for the Republican Future provides what he calls "an outline . . . of bipartisan legislation to achieve principled conservative health care reform."
-- Individual and group health plans should be made renewable without premium increases due to pre-existing conditions of those already covered by a policy.
-- Individuals who already have health insurance should, if they change jobs or move, be permitted to enroll in similar plans without facing premium increases due to health status.
-- Individuals who work at small companies should be allowed to continue their insurance coverage for a transitional period after they leave their job; existing COBRA legislation should be extended to cover businesses with fewer than 50 employees.
-- Individuals and the self-employed should be able to deduct the full cost of their health insurance from their personal income tax -- the same tax advantage enjoyed by those who now get health coverage from their employer.
-- Employers should be able to offer medical savings accounts -- essentially tax-free medical IRAs -- in conjunction with a catastrophic health care plan.
-- Small businesses should be allowed to pool together to buy group insurance for their employees without facing cumbersome federal and state regulations and mandates.
-- Individuals should be able to obtain health insurance through nonbusiness organizations such as churches, unions, or fraternal organizations.
-- Working heads of households who do not earn enough to afford a family insurance plan should receive a government voucher to help defray the costs.
The voucher could be made available on a sliding scale up to a family of four earning, say, $23,000 a year -- approximately 160% of the poverty line.
Similar results could be obtained by designing a tax credit for this group of Americans.
Funding for this proposal could be found in currently proposed Medicare cuts and by redirecting federal payments already made to states for hospitals treating low-income individuals.
-- Federal and state health care programs should standardize their forms and set a timetable for reducing the amount of paperwork they generate.
-- The first steps of medical malpractice reform should be instituted: for example, effectively eliminating pain and suffering awards if an early offer is made to have the defendant assume the full economic cost of malpractice claims.
The bipartisan Gephardt-Moore bill of the 1980s proposed a similar reform.
-- The federal government should create a fast-track regulation waiver process for states that wish to administer their Medicaid programs in different ways.
Priority should be given to states that intend to use voucher systems to give Medicaid patients greater access to private health care or create cost-saving managed care systems such as those in Massachusetts or Wisconsin.
