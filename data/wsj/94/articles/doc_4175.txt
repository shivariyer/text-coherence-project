The AFL-CIO has released an additional $1.25 million for advertisements backing health-care reform, including a tough series of ads noting the generous benefits received by members of Congress.
The timing and tone of the ads have been a subject of dispute within the labor federation.
While all AFL-CIO member unions back health-care reform, a splinter group wants to run hard-hitting ads urging viewers and listeners in targeted districts to compare their benefits with those of lawmakers.
That approach bothered some top Democrats on Capitol Hill, including House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), who fears a backlash against incumbents if Congress is held out as an island of perks.
The AFL-CIO will feed $500,000 to the Campaign for Health Security, whose ads will make the comparison with congressional benefits.
Originally put together to support a "single-payer" health-care system, the group now has become a hard-line supporter of the Clinton administration's plan.
A single-payer system, in which the government would provide benefits to everyone, is politically all but dead.
The federation will send $750,000 to the Health Care Reform Project, a group made up of labor representatives, the American Association of Retired Persons and others.
Those funds will be used for more general ads.
The AFL-CIO is planning to spend more than $3 million for health-care ads this year, but has sent out less than $500,000 so far.
Crucial House negotiations on the health-care plan will begin next month.
