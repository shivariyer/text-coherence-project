Two Gitano Group Inc. shareholders sued Gitano and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., alleging that the companies had conspired to mislead shareholders about Gitano's weakened financial condition in order to artificially inflate the market price of Gitano shares.
Class-action status is sought for the civil suit, filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
Earlier this week, Gitano decided to put itself up for sale after Wal-Mart, its biggest customer, said it would no longer do business with Gitano because the apparel maker had pleaded guilty in December to U.S. Customs violations.
On Tuesday, three of Gitano's outside directors resigned, and the New York Stock Exchange applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist Gitano.
The plaintiffs, Peter Gershon and Jay Glatzer, are seeking unspecified damages for themselves and all holders who bought Gitano stock between April 5, 1993, and Jan. 24, 1994.
Gitano said the complaint is "totally without merit."
Wal-Mart officials didn't return telephone calls seeking comment.
