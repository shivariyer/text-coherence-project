That beeping noise you hear isn't in your head.
It's Houston.
Blame it on urban sprawl.
Or on all those oil-firm workers who toil far from telephones.
Or on vanity.
But whatever the reason, there seem to be more pagers per capita in Houston than almost anywhere else.
According to estimates by Paging Network Inc., a carrier based in Plano, 12% of Houstonians carried pagers at the end of last year.
That compares with 10% in Dallas, 6% in Austin and San Antonio -- and 7.4% in the U.S. as a whole.
"It's phenomenal.
At the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo last month, every other person with a cowboy hat and belt buckle was wearing a pager," says Miles Johnson, who is general manager of the local office of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., Kirkland, Wash.
The booming market has companies descending on the city.
Six national paging carriers are rubbing elbows in Houston.
And then there are the approximately 50 smaller "resellers" -- companies that buy air time from the national carriers and market it to customers.
The competition means that Houston consumers enjoy some of the lowest prices in the nation.
A Houston business can lease 100 pagers for only about $4.95 a month, including air time, compared with about $6.50 in Dallas and $15 in Los Angeles, says Danny Ragsdale, general manager of the Houston office of MobileComm, a Ridgeland, Miss., unit of Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp.
Some big employers have even negotiated prices under $4.
Now, the downside: Because Houston is such a hot market, the obvious users of pagers -- such as doctors, nurses, plumbers and electricians -- are being besieged by telemarketers who promise better service and lower prices.
"You are more likely to get a call from a paging telemarketer in Houston than in most other cities in the nation," says Terry Scott, chief executive officer of Paging Network.
