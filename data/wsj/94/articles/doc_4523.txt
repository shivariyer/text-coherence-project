In response to your Feb. 4 editorial "Healthy Business": Our present health-care system is responsible for creating the highest quality and most innovative medical care in the history of the world.
This is largely due to businesses' desires to increase profits.
I suggest we leave the incentives alone -- there is no problem there.
According to even the most hysterical of the critics of our medical system, the principal problem lies with the 18 million uninsured citizens who have no way of buying into the system.
Thus the urge to tinker with prices, thereby distorting supply and demand signals, is strong.
The answer, however, is to issue vouchers to those in need of financial assistance.
Less affluent patients would pay their health-related bills with the vouchers, while the doctors, hospitals and pharmacies would receive cash for their vouchers directly from the U.S. government.
Admittedly, this would be expensive, but the quality of health care in this country would still be allowed to improve, and other less efficient means of rationing could be avoided.
