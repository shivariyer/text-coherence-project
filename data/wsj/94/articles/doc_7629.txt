Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., a major Japanese car maker that produces Subarubrand cars, will cut its white-collar labor force by 500-600 employees during the fiscal year beginning April 1, a company spokeswoman said.
The company will make the cuts by reducing the number of new employees hired and by not replacing some retiring employees, instead of by resorting to layoffs, she added.
Of its total labor force of 15,000, Fuji Heavy has 4,000 white-collar employees involved in management, accounting and operations.
The spokeswoman said Fuji Heavy has no estimates of the cost savings for the next fiscal year from the personnel cuts.
Fuji Heavy has seen sluggish sales for several years and posted a net loss in two of the past three years.
