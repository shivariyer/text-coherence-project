Former Secretary of State Shultz -- in his Jan. 28 Letter to the Editor in response to my Jan. 24 editorial page article -- says I was wrong to say that Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh had reported that Mr. Shultz had admitted false testimony.
Here is what Mr. Walsh wrote (p. 373 of his Final Report):
". . . central and important aspects of Shultz's testimony to congressional committees . . . were incorrect. . . .
In his 1992 interviews with Walsh's team, Shultz ultimately acknowledged that his testimony had been incorrect . . .
Walsh declined to prosecute because the evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Shultz's testimony was willfully false."
Readers may judge for themselves if I was wrong.
