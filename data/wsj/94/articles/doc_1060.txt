The three main corporate defendants in the breast-implant litigation formally agreed to set up a global fund of nearly $4 billion to compensate the one million or more women worldwide who have silicone implants, according to the companies and negotiators.
Agreeing to the world's largest product-liability deal were Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Baxter International Inc. and Dow Corning Corp., a joint venture of the Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc.
As previously reported, the three companies had reached agreement on all major issues last week and have since been drafting a final document.
The settlement, which would affect all federal and state litigation over silicone breast implants, will still have to be approved by U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. in Birmingham, Ala., who supervises the consolidated federal lawsuits over the implants.
If he does, women will be allowed a time frame of several months, probably beginning this fall, to decide to participate in the deal or to "opt out" and pursue individual lawsuits.
Dow Corning and Bristol-Myers no longer make breast implants.
Baxter never did, but inherited liability through a 1985 merger.
Plaintiffs' lawyers still are negotiating with the last major manufacturer still holding out, Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., which owned an implant manufacturing company from 1977 to 1984.
