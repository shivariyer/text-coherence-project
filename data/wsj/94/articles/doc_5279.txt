Sierra On-Line Inc. will restate results upward for the third and fourth quarters of 1993 to reflect a new way of accounting for its ImagiNation Network unit.
Sierra, based in Bellevue, Wash., will now account for only 58% of the unit's results, down from 100% previously.
The change, the result of consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reflects Sierra's July 1993 sale of equity stakes in the unit, apparently equal to 42%, to American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and General Atlantic Partners, a New York investment firm.
The size of the stake wasn't disclosed at the time.
Because the unit posted losses for the quarters being restated, accounting for less of its results will increase Sierra's results overall for the periods.
It was unclear what the restated results will be.
The move comes less than three weeks after the software company's chief financial officer, Richard A. Gelhaus, resigned.
