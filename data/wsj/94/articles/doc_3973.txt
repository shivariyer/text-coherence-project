First Commercial Corp. said its subsidiary, First Commercial Bank N.A. of Little Rock, has substantially reduced its nonperforming assets by selling part of the Crestwood Co. property in North Little Rock on which it has held a mortgage for several years.
The proceeds lowered the balance of other real estate by 71% at First Commercial Bank and by 47% for First Commercial Corp.
An amount was received in excess of the balance in other real estate; however, the corporation's first-quarter earnings won't be materially affected.
