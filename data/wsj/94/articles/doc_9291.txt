Ford Motor Co. said it plans to sell all of its shares of Excel Industries Inc., ending the auto maker's minority ownership of the company.
Excel, based in Elkhart, Ind., designs and makes automotive window systems.
Ford and Ford Motor Co.
Fund, a nonprofit charitable organization, own 2,557,128 shares of Excel common stock, or roughly 24% of the total shares outstanding.
Based on Excel's closing price yesterday of $18.375 on the American Stock Exchange, the shares are valued at $47 million.
Ford initially spent $19 million in 1986 to acquire a 40% stake in Excel, but sold some of those shares in 1992 and last year.
The latest sale won't dilute Ford's per-share earnings, the company said.
FORD MOTOR Co.'s 40% ownership in Excel Industries Inc. was diluted over time to a 24% stake as Excel sold new equity.
An article Friday incorrectly reported that Ford sold Excel shares.
