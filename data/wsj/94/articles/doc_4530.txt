Unilever NV is tackling fierce competition in the consumer-goods market with a major restructuring program.
An extraordinary restructuring charge of 1.37 billion guilders ($713.1 million) contributed to a 10% drop in the Anglo-Dutch group's profit for 1993.
Profit fell to 3.61 billion guilders, while sales rose slightly to 77.63 billion guilders.
On the Amsterdam stock exchange, Unilever's shares slid 2.8% to 221.50 guilders ($115.29).
The company, whose products include Magnum ice cream, Pond's skin cream and Omo detergent, said it plans to reduce its staff of 294,000 by 2%.
Over the next three years, the company, based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, also wants to cut costs for production, logistics and management in 60 locations.
More than half of the measures will take place in Europe, while about a third are slated for Unilever's ailing U.S. detergent business.
