Jostens Inc. said it agreed to sell its Artex Manufacturing sportswear business to Chicago-based apparel maker Fruit of the Loom Inc. for $46.7 million.
The Minneapolis maker of class rings, yearbooks and educational software disclosed last summer that it wanted to sell the unit, saying it didn't fit with Jostens' "strategic focus."
The sportswear unit's management subsequently proposed to acquire the operation, and Jostens disclosed in November that it had received an unsolicited rival proposal for Artex from a party it didn't identify.
A spokesman confirmed that the November bid came from Fruit of the Loom.
Artex, under licensing arrangements, manufactures clothes decorated with logos of sports teams, Disney figures and the like; it had sales in the fiscal year ended June 30 of about $76 million.
