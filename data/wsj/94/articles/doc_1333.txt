Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon cable channel said it would invest $30 million over three years in developing and producing original programming for its pre-school programming block, called Nick Jr.
The investment, the largest of its kind for the 15-year-old network, includes an agreement with Jim Henson Productions, an independent film, TV and video production company, to create original programming and characters for Nick Jr.
The plan calls for Nick Jr. to add at least one hour of original programming each year for the next three years.
The Nick Jr. block, created in 1986, airs 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays for pre-schoolers, parents, and others who provide care.
