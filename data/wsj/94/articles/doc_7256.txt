The general partners of 17 partnerships that own self-service storage centers indicated they are close to winning approval of a plan to consolidate the partnerships into a publicly traded company.
Meanwhile, U-Haul International Inc., which is trying to acquire the partnerships for $357.5 million, said few partnership units have been tendered to it.
The partnerships are managed by Shurgard Inc. of Seattle, whose controlling shareholder is a general partner of all the partnerships.
Shurgard is fighting U-Haul's bid, saying it falls well short of the net asset value of the partnerships and their likely valuation by the stock market.
Shurgard said it had been tendered a majority of the units of 15 of the partnerships and close to a majority of the units of two other partnerships.
The Shurgard offer expires Feb. 22.
U-Haul, controlled by the Shoen family through its Amerco holding company, said no more than 7% of the units of any of the partnerships had been tendered to it.
The U-Haul offer expires Feb. 28.
