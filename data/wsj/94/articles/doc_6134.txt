Engelhard Corp. said it would take a $91.8 million restructuring charge, causing a fourth-quarter loss of $61.6 million.
Englehard, based in Iselin, N.J., said most of the 96 cents a share charge related to "assets write-offs, business relocations and employee costs with the balance for environmental matters."
For the quarter, the loss per share was 64 cents compared with net income of $28.1 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier.
Without the charge, the maker of specialty chemical products and engineered materials said net income would have been up more than 7% to $30.2 million, or 32 cents a share.
Sales were $539.4 million, down about 1% from $546.1 million
The company said its actions will allow it to "further realign and consolidate businesses, concentrate resources and better position itself."
For the year, Engelhard said net income $672,000, or one cent a share, compared with net income of $10.6 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier.
