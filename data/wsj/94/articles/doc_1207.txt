Amre Inc., Dallas, said it received a letter from a Dallas financial adviser representing investors interested in buying the company.
The kitchen-cabinet marketer said it has received no formal offer either from the adviser, LSI Capital, or from the investors, who weren't identified.
"As far as the board of Amre is concerned, no offer has been made," a spokesman said.
LSI, which didn't return telephone calls, said the investors primarily are interested in purchasing 21% of the company's shares outstanding held by two former executives who left the company in 1991 and later agreed to a consent decree in a federal securities probe.
According to the LSI letter, the investors are willing to buy the pair's stock for $4.85 a share, or about $62 million, "provided that the transaction is completed with the consent and cooperation of Amre's board."
The letter also said it is willing to consider buying all of the company's shares at the same price in a "friendly" transaction.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Amre shares closed at $4, down 25 cents.
