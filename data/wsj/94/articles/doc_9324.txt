ValueVision International Inc., seeking to create what it said would be a "leader in the interactive video shopping marketplace of the future," launched an unsolicited $10-a-share stock-and-cash bid for National Media Corp.
The bid by the nation's third-largest home-shopping network has an indicated value of about $117.5 million.
National Media, a Philadelphia-based television marketer, had no immediate comment.
ValueVision also disclosed that it has compiled a 9.8% National Media stake since mid-December.
While it said it seeks a friendly merger, the company hinted it isn't averse to making a hostile effort.
ValueVision said it had more than $50 million in cash and a debt-free balance sheet and is "confident" financing could be arranged promptly.
Under terms of the proposal, ValueVision would pay cash for a 50.1% stake in National Media; the remainder of the purchase would be in ValueVision Class A stock.
The proposal is set to expire at 5:01 p.m.
Eastern time on Jan. 21.
The disclosure came after the market's close.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, National Media shares closed at $8.25, up 50 cents, or 6.5%.
ValueVision's chairman and chief executive officer, Robert L. Johander, said in a letter to National Media's board that "based upon the opportunities for growth in the television home-shopping market in which ValueVision operates and in the television direct-response industry in which you compete, we have concluded that a combination . . . would be in the best interests of stockholders of both companies."
National Media officials couldn't be reached for comment.
