Prudential Corp. of Britain said that new, annualized business it generated for 1993 fell 3.2%, to #101.6 million ($151.6 million) from a year-earlier #105 million.
New-business premiums, a common measure of performance for British insurers, consists of annual premiums plus 10% of single premiums.
World-wide new annual-premium sales for 1993 fell 9%, to #536 million from #592 million, reflecting "a continued reluctance by consumers to enter into regular long-term financial commitments," said Prudential, which is unrelated to Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
Total new single premiums rose 5%, to #479.8 million from #458.1 million.
In the United Kingdom, single-premium sales grew a healthy 24%, to #244.2 million from #197.4 million, reflecting strong sales of the Prudence Bond and pension business.
Annual-premium sales, on the other hand, fell 12% in the U.K., to #286 million from #325 million, "following an expected decline" in the sale of "industrial branch," or cash collection, policies, Prudential said.
Sales at U.S. subsidiary Jackson National Life were "disappointing," Prudential said, showing a decline in single premiums to #1.07 billion ($1.6 billion) from #1.58 billion.
Jackson National's business was also affected by low interest rates and competition from equity-based products.
Prudential said Jackson National has launched a new range of annuity products which "should prove more attractive in the current economic climate."
It also said it plans more product launches this year.
