Deltona Corp. said it is experiencing a "severe shortfall" in working capital due to its inability to obtain financing.
The Miami-based developer of nine planned communities in Florida said two of its largest shareholders, which also are lenders, informed the company that they may not be able to provide additional funding.
One of the shareholders, Selex International BV in Amsterdam, and its affiliates have provided Deltona with $5.4 million in loans and other payments during the past several months.
Due to the funding problems, Deltona said it's in default on payment obligations to a Division of Florida Land Sales escrow fund, to its corporate-office landlord, and to lenders such as Selex.
Deltona disclosed its capital shortfall after markets closed yesterday.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Deltona closed at $1.125 a share, down 25 cents, or 18%.
