International Paper Co. said it would shut down a printing and writing paper mill in Oswego, N.Y., on April 4 because of weak market conditions.
The paper company added that it is curtailing printing and writing grade paper capacity at several other mills.
The company said industry overcapacity continues to contribute to poor market conditions.
