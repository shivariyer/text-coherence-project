Robert C. Pew III, president of Steelcase Inc.'s North American operations and a candidate to run the company, abruptly resigned to "put a little more balance back into my personal life."
Mr. Pew, 43 years old, is the grandson of one of the founders of the world's largest office-furniture maker.
Many believed he would succeed his father, Robert C. Pew, 71 years old, as chairman.
The younger Mr. Pew will continue to serve on the board and will remain on the executive committee.
Some industry observers said Mr. Pew had become unhappy with cost-cutting measures implemented by Jerry Myers, Steelcase's chief executive officer, and with recent employee efforts to unionize Steelcase because of dissatisfaction with management.
Mr. Pew said he isn't leaving because he's dissatisfied, but feels that "many of the changes we've tried to put in place over the past five years have been implemented."
Now, he said, "it is time for me to change direction and put balance back in my life."
Steelcase is a closely held company.
Descendants of Mr. Pew's grandfather, Walter Idema, hold a majority stake of the company, Mr. Pew said.
Descendants of the other two founders, Peter Wege and David Hunting, hold a substantial portion and are represented on the board.
