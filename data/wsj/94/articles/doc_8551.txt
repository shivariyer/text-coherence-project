The U.S. withdrew its threat of trade sanctions after Japan's cabinet endorsed a broad plan to open the nation's public-works market to foreign construction companies.
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor praised the Japanese plan as "an historic step forward" because it makes the "bidding process more transparent and objective."
The U.S. action had been expected.
The two sides have been working to devise a mutually agreeable system; the U.S. also realizes that a sanctions battle would wreck other trade negotiations with Japan that are moving toward their conclusion.
In those framework talks, the U.S. is pressing Japan to accept targets for foreign imports.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten, who is traveling in Asia, plans to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii Sunday to stress the importance the U.S. places on those talks.
Both sides are looking for an agreement by Feb. 11 when Mr. Hosokawa comes to Washington to meet President Clinton.
In the construction negotiations, the U.S. settled for much less than it has been seeking in the broader framework talks.
The two sides will track how well foreign construction companies do, but the Japanese won't have to meet any numerical goal.
"Procedural changes" in the public-works area is a "better way to proceed," Mr. Kantor said.
