Entergy Corp. said the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved new rates that would reduce annual revenue for its Mississippi Power & Light Co. unit by $28.1 million.
The reduction represents a 3.7% decrease in Mississippi Power & Light's revenue from retail sales.
The plan, however, ensures an 11% return on equity.
The new rates take effect March 25.
