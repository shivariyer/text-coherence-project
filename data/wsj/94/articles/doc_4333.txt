Savin Corp.'s chief executive officer, Joseph M. O'Donnell, announced his resignation from the company after serving fewer than three months in that position.
In a statement, Savin said Mr. O'Donnell "noted that while he had differences in management philosophy with the Savin board of directors, they have always had a good working relationship."
The company offered no further comment.
Mr. O'Donnell, 47 years old, was named vice president and chief executive officer designate at Savin in October and became chief executive officer Dec. 14, the same day the marketer of copiers and other products emerged from Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
D. Thomas Abbott, Savin's chairman, said the company will immediately begin looking for a successor to Mr. O'Donnell.
