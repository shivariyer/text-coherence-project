Thomas H. Bruggere, 48 years old, said he is retiring as chairman effective April 26.
Mr. Bruggere said he decided to retire "well over a year ago," because after 13 years with the company, "I don't think you can do high-tech all your life."
Mentor makes software used in electronic circuit designs.
Mr. Bruggere said he is considering starting a new company, getting involved in education or running for state or national office.
Mentor is searching outside the company for a successor to Mr. Bruggere.
Walden Rhine will remain as Mentor's chief executive.
