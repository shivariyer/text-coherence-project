Lincoln Foodservice Products Inc. said it has been approached by an unidentified party interested in purchasing the maker of food-service equipment.
The Fort Wayne, Ind., company, which said it isn't currently in talks regarding the possible purchase, has hired the investment banking firm of Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co. to assist it in evaluating its financial alternatives that would maximize shareholder value and "promote liquidity for common stockholders."
Lincoln recently reported earnings of $3.4 million, or $1.02 a share, on sales of $57.6 million for 1993.
In Nasdaq trading yesterday, Lincoln's shares rose $1, to $13.50.
