3Com Corp. said it took a $134.5 million pretax charge to cover costs of two acquisitions, but, excluding the charge, it reported third-quarter profit that topped analysts' expectations.
Including the charge, the Santa Clara, Calif., computer-networking company reported a net loss of $103.5 million, or $3.28 a share, in the fiscal quarter ended Feb. 28, compared with net income of $10.2 million, or 31 cents a share, the year earlier.
Sales rose to $218.1 million from $161.3 million.
Excluding the charge, net would have been $24.9 million, or 72 cents a share.
Analysts had expected the company to earn about 66 cents a share.
The charge stemmed from 3Com's acquisition of two smaller networking companies -- Synernetics Inc., for $104 million, and Centrum Communications Inc., for $36 million, the company said.
