Flooded with cash from individuals pursuing foreign-stock investments, Acorn International fund will close its doors to new investors on Friday.
"This thing has gone out of control with people looking for various ways to get money oversees," says Ralph Wanger of Wanger Asset Management, L.P., the Chicago-based investment adviser to Acorn International.
Launched in September 1992, the fund had a whopping return of 49.11% in 1993 and is up 5.4% so far this year.
With about $1.2 billion in total assets currently, Acorn International has been receiving an additional $10 million to $15 million a day from investors, says Mr. Wanger.
"We've obviously been one of the funds investors are turning to.
But in a small-stock investment format we don't want to have to buy too many names to use up all the money."
Acorn International invests in small companies, mostly under $1 billion in market value, from about 38 different countries.
Recently the fund has increased its exposure in Mexican stocks, which make up 4% of its total assets.
