Metallgesellschaft AG's shares plunged 10.5% in a sell-off reflecting general pessimism over the company's prospects before the group's earnings report today and a shareholders' meeting Thursday.
"The market is waiting eagerly, but the earnings will not be a major event," said Stefan Ermisch, an institutional trader for Merck, Finck & Co. in Duesseldorf, Germany.
He added that traders expect the company to confirm dire predictions for the current year.
Some reports have suggested the fiscal 1994 loss could match last year's loss of 1.8 billion marks ($1 billion).
The German company's shares fell on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to 175.50 marks from 196 marks.
Adding to the company's difficulties, the German shareholder-protection group DSW said it would broaden its request for a special inquiry to include Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board.
