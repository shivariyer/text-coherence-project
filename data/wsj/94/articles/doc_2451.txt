The European Union Commission said it will investigate proposed government subsidies to state-owned airlines TAP-Air Portugal and Olympic Airways of Greece.
The commission said the inquiry will seek to verify that restructuring plans attached to the proposed subsidies are sufficent to address the airlines' problems and return them to financial viability without damaging competition in the EU.
The commission will examine the proposed capital increase of as much as 180 billion escudos ($1.02 billion) for TAP, under which the Portuguese government will take over part of the airline's debts and guarantee TAP's borrowings.
The financial help and a tax exemption, which is also under investigation, are part of a restructuring plan aimed at restoring TAP to financial and economic viability by the end of 1997.
The commission said the probe of subsidies to Olympic Airways will include loan guarantees given to the company since 1986 in addition to proposed debt conversion of as much as 1.18 billion European Currency Units ($1.34 billion), a capital injection of 96 million ECUs and new loan guarantees.
The commission said it has "doubts" over whether the subsidies are in line with EU rules.
It said it must have assurances that the subsidies won't "transfer Olympic Airways' difficulties" to its EU competitors.
