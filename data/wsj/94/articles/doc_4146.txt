A jury ruled that Ford Motor Co. must pay $10.5 million in damages for failing to provide enough support to a struggling car dealership operating under an incentive program for minority-owned businesses.
The dealership later failed in 1991, after attempting to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., said it plans to appeal the verdict delivered Wednesday by a Lowndes County, Ala., jury.
Sam Foster, who is black, and Dee-Witt Sperau, who is white, were awarded a Ford dealership under the incentive program in 1988.
They claimed they were forced into bankruptcy in 1991 due to a lack of support from Ford.
Ford, however, argued that the River City Ford dealership in Selma, Ala., failed because the partners spent the business's money on personal expenses.
The partners denied any wasteful spending.
In addition to the judgment against Ford, the jury ordered Mr. Foster and Ms. Sperau to pay Ford Motor Credit $635,000 to compensate for a loan used to start the business.
The partners could not be reached for comment.
