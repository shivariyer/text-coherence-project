ValueVision International Inc. said National Media Corp., which rejected its hostile takeover bid last month, agreed to a sweetened offer to buy the company for about $150 million.
In February, Minneapolis-based ValueVision launched a $10-a-share stock-and-cash bid, which National Media rejected as "inadequate."
As a result, ValueVision threatened to start a proxy fight at National Media's annual meeting on March 21, asking the company's shareholders to seat eight new directors in favor of its takeover bid.
But National Media, a Philadelphia television marketing concern, was persuaded to accept the deal when ValueVision, a home-shopping network, raised its bid to $11.50 a share, and made it an all-cash offering.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market, ValueVision Class A shares soared $1.375 a share, or 17.7%, to close at $9.125.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, National Media stock rose 87.5 cents, or 8.5%, to close at $11.125.
