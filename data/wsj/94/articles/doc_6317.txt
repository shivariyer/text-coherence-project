The Clinton budget would jack up the price of cigarettes, as well as making it more expensive to visit Yellowstone, get a copy of your tax return, sell a gun or trade stocks.
The new budget hits only smokers with a tax increase, up 75 cents a pack to 99 cents, which would pay for the administration's ambitious health-care plan.
But the budget would raise about $1.5 billion in new user fees in fiscal 1995, yielding about $8.4 billion through 1999.
In a budget geared toward reducing the deficit, the user fees are more palatable politically than higher taxes.
For one thing, they don't require separate tax legislation.
Moreover, the fees help cover the costs of government services without adding to the budget deficit.
"These are important because they allow you to spend more on other things," said Stanley Collender of Price Waterhouse, who closely follows the federal budget.
Leon Panetta, head of the Office of Management and Budget, defended the user fees at a news conference yesterday, saying that they don't exceed those in spending plans proposed by congressional Republicans.
Wall Street and pharmaceutical companies get hit with the biggest fees.
The budget estimates that the Food and Drug Administration will reap $338 million in fiscal 1995 by charging drug companies for the process of approving new products.
The FDA fees stem from recent laws calling for speedier FDA approvals or rejections of new drugs and medical devices as well as for new inspections for mammography equipment.
An application for the FDA to test and approve a new drug, for example, will be $208,000 in fiscal 1995.
The FDA is to increase its staffing for those purposes.
A variety of securities fees would raise $378 million in fiscal 1995.
For instance, the fee on the sales of stocks would increase to 1/250 of 1% of the sales amount from 1/300 of 1%.
And all those corporate titans battling to buy Paramount Communications Inc., beware: The fee on tender offers and mergers will increase to 1/29 of 1% of the transaction price from 1/50 of 1%.
That $10 billion deal, for example, would result in a $3.4 million fee to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
-- A boost in the maximum drive-in fee at national parks to $16 from the current $10.
-- Gun dealers would be assessed $600 a year, up from $200 a year, raising $25 million a year.
-- The Internal Revenue Service would charge $12 for photocopies of tax returns, up from $4.25 previously, raising $5 million.
-- And the Agriculture Department would begin charging for overtime for its meat and poultry inspectors, raising $103 million in fiscal 1995.
