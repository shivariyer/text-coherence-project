The European Union (EU) Commission said it had cleared a joint venture between international engineering concern Asea Brown Boveri and Renault Automation, a unit of Renault SA, to combine their robotics and automobile manufacturing systems.
In a statement, the commission said the joint venture doesn't create or strengthen a dominant position in the EU's common market.
