Fashion designer Bill Blass pledged $10 million to the New York Public Library, one of its largest gifts ever, the institution announced.
Half of the contribution is earmarked for new technology, staff, and services in the public catalog room, with the remainder going to unrestricted endowment.
The catalog room at the midtown Manhattan landmark will be named after Mr. Blass, who has been a library trustee since 1986.
