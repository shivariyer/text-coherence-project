Quaker Oats Co., Chicago, raised prices of its ready-to-eat cereals an average of 2.2%.
The move, Quaker's first such increase in more than a year, came in response to a recent price increase, averaging 3.3%, by market-leader Kellogg Co., and could rekindle price wars in the $8 billion U.S. cold cereal market.
"This wasn't something we wanted to do," Quaker chairman William D. Smithburg said, adding that "the current arena suggests we need to meet the competition."
Mr. Smithburg said Quaker probably would "deal back" much of the increases in the forms of deeper discounts -- which may well mean higher-value coupons for consumers and more in-store specials.
Asked about a recent statement by Kellogg's chairman that he hoped to avoid costly price wars, Mr. Smithburg replied, "I watch feet.
Action is what counts."
Quaker has 7.8% of the domestic ready-to-eat cereal market; Kellogg 37%.
