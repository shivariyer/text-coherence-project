First Chesapeake Financial Corp. said its chairman resigned and will sell much of his holdings in the mortgage banking company.
John E. Dell, 45 years old, said he resigned for several reasons, including other business commitments and philanthropic pursuits.
Mr. Dell had been chairman of the company since May 1992.
The duties of chairman will be assumed by First Chesapeake's president and chief executive officer, Max E. Gray, 44.
First Chesapeake said Mr. Dell has set up a disposition trust to sell 550,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 300,000 shares.
He will continue to own 450,000 common shares, or about 9.9% of the company's common shares.
Separately, the company said it completed its merger with Waterford Mortgage Corp., putting it into the residential loan origination business.
