South Korea's Goldstar Co. said 1993 profit more than doubled and sales jumped 14% as a result of its year-long efforts to streamline operations.
The company's unconsolidated statement showed that net income jumped to 65.63 billion won ($81.1 million) from 26.52 billion won in 1992.
Sales rose to 4.32 trillion won from 3.79 trillion won.
Exports led the company's sales gains, with a healthy 17% rise to a total of 2.33 trillion won.
Exports to such new markets as Southeast Asian countries and China were particularly strong.
Domestic sales rose 11% to 1.99 trillion won.
The company is targeting 1994 sales of 5.10 trillion won.
Goldstar attributed the sharp rise in profit to its leaner organization and continued investment in technology, which helped hone the company's competitiveness in world markets.
