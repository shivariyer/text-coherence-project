Shares of Liuski International Inc. skidded 27% after the company reported a sharp decrease in fourth-quarter profit partly because of lower gross profit margins and competition.
Net income was $678,392, or 15 cents a share, down from $1.1 million, or 34 cents a share.
Liuski said if year-ago earnings were adjusted for its secondary public offering of 1.1 million shares in May 1993, comparable fourth-quarter earnings would have been 25 cents a share.
Liuski, of Melville, N.Y., said it was "disappointed" with the results, blaming the lower profits on a reduction in manufacturer incentives, increases in sales promotion programs that didn't meet expected sales volume and competitive industry conditions.
Revenue, however, rose 37% to $84.4 million from $61.7 million.
Liuski's shares closed at $9, down $3.25 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
The company is a distributor of microcomputer peripherals, components and accessories and it also makes personal computers.
