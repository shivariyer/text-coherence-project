Greyhound Lines Inc., Dallas, said its board adopted a rights plan to protect shareholders "in light of recent declines" in the company's stock price.
The move came after a Canadian investment concern tripled its Greyhound stake.
Amid falling ridership, the stock has been struggling, closing at $11.375 yesterday on the American Stock Exchange, up from $10.875.
The bus company's stock was trading as high as $22.75 last May.
The company said that Connor Clark & Co., a Toronto-based investment-management concern, had acquired about 18.2% of Greyhound's 14.7 million common shares outstanding, up from a 6% stake as of Dec. 31.
"It's just for investment purposes purely," a Connor Clark spokesman said.
Greyhound said it would distribute one right for each common share outstanding at the close of business on April 4.
If any party acquires at least 15% of the company's stock, or announces an offer to acquire 30% or more, the rights entitle other shareholders to acquire additional shares in Greyhound or the acquiring entity at a 50% discount from the market.
