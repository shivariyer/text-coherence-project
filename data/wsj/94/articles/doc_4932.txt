MasterCard International Inc. sued Sprint Corp. and World Cup USA 1994 Inc. for allegedly violating its exclusive worldwide rights to use the soccer competition's trademark and design logos on "card-based payment and account access devices" and other similar products.
The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the violation occurred when Los Angeles-based World Cup USA 1994, the organizing committee for this year's games, granted the long-distance phone company the right to use the World Cup marks in association with Sprint's telephone calling cards.
MasterCard, one of 11 World Cup sponsors, said it learned of the development last September.
Sprint, Kansas City, Mo., said the prepaid calling cards aren't credit devices but are used solely to access Sprint services.
"We are surprised and disappointed by MasterCard International's suit, and we will take appropriate legal measures to vigorously protect our rights to issue and market World Cup prepaid calling cards," the company said.
World Cup USA declined to comment.
