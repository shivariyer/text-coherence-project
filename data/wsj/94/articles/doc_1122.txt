Yields on bank certificates of deposit rose across the board in the latest week, pushing the popular six-month small-denomination CD to 3% for the first time in a year and a half.
The average yield on six-month "savings" CDs offered by major banks inched up from 2.99% in the week ended yesterday, according to a survey by Banxquote Money Markets.
The Wilmington, Del., information service said the average yield on five-year small-denomination CDs rose to 4.72% from 4.70%.
CD yields have been rising steadily since the Federal Reserve moved to increase short-term interest rates in early February.
Yesterday, the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee decided on a further increase, a move that could come as soon as today.
On large-denomination "jumbo" certificates, which typically require deposits of $95,000 and more, Banxquote said the average yield increased in the latest week to 3.19% from 3.13% on six-month CDs, and to 5.10% from 5.04% on five-year CDs.
The average yield on six-month CDs sold by major brokerage firms remained at 3.46% in the latest week, according to Banxquote.
The average on five-year broker-sold certificates of deposit rose to 4.93% from 4.84%, the survey found.
