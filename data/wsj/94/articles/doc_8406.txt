The French government said it will start shedding control of oil giant Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine within several weeks when it puts $6 billion of the company's stock on the block.
The offering will entail 88.5 million of Elf's 257 million shares hitting global markets in a series of tranches.
The government, which owns 51% of the company, expects to retain 13% ownership.
The offering comes at a difficult time for the oil industry, which has been enduring oil prices at five-year lows.
The timing for the company isn't any better, with debt continuing to grow, reaching almost 50% of equity at the end of 1993.
And net income for 1993, reported earlier this week, slipped by about 82%.
The French government hasn't given the exact date when Elf shares will go on sale, but the action is expected next month.
The government intends to place 22 million shares with a core group of stable institutional shareholders, expected to be mainly major French companies.
These investors must pledge to hold their shares for several years, creating a type of poison pill to prevent takeovers.
