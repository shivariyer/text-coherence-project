Bankers Trust New York Corp. said market conditions have been "difficult" and "adversely affected certain of the corporation's trading positions," but said the bank continues to be profitable, according to its 1993 annual report.
The comment is the first time that Bankers Trust has confirmed it has had problems in trading financial assets, where the bank earns the bulk of its money.
The bank had been the subject of widespread rumors about trading losses a few weeks ago, and was forced to issue a statement saying the company was profitable thus far in 1994.
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Bankers Trust closed at $75, down $1.125.
Meanwhile, Bankers Trust Chairman Charles Sanford earned nearly $10 million last year, according to the company's proxy statement, a 47% increase from 1992.
That includes about $3 million in a cash bonus and $5 million in stock bonus.
Last year, the company had earnings of $1.07 billion, up 67% from 1992.
