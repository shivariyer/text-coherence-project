Continental Airlines said its January traffic fell 8.6%, to 2.99 billion revenue-passenger miles from 3.27 billion a year ago.
A revenue-passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile.
Load factor, or percentage of seats filled, rose slightly to 57.1% from 56.2%.
The airline has said that January's cold weather on the East Coast affected its operations.
