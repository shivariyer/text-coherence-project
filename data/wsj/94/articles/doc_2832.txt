Nielsen Marketing Research, a unit of Dun & Bradstreet Corp., reclaimed two more clients from archrival Information Resources Inc. in their seesaw battle for business.
Nielsen, Northbrook, Ill., said Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceuticals giant, signed a multiyear contract that includes its J&J/Merck and McNeil Consumer Products Co. units.
Both branches, representing several million dollars in annual billings, had left Nielsen for IRI in 1991.
Those signings follow the expected defection of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. from IRI, Chicago, back to Nielsen.
The Johnson & Johnson business returned to Nielsen after what the market-data concern characterized as "a very competitive battle."
James G. Andress, IRI vice chairman and co-chief executive officer, expressed "regret" at the Johnson & Johnson units' departures, but said they had occurred "in the face of whopping discounts."
On the Nasdaq Stock Market, IRI closed at $21.50, down $1, or 4.4%.
