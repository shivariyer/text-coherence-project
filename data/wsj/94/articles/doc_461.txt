First Chicago Corp. said it received Federal Reserve Board approval to underwrite and distribute corporate debt securities through its First Chicago Capital Markets Inc. unit.
The unit, established in 1988, already underwrites government securities, municipal bonds, commercial paper, consumer-related asset-backed securities and certain other instruments.
First Chicago, with $52.6 billion in assets, joins the growing number of banking companies authorized to underwrite corporate debt.
