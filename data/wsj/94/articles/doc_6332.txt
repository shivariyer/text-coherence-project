Legent Corp. said a federal court in Virginia dismissed a securities class-action lawsuit against the mainframe software concern.
The Herndon, Va., company and several officers and directors had been sued by shareholders in July; the suit alleged they violated federal securities laws by issuing false and misleading statements.
The suit had been filed after Legent projected lower earnings for the fiscal third quarter when analysts had been expecting a healthy increase.
Legent shares in July traded as high as $36 a share and as low as $15.50 a share.
Legent President and Chief Executive John F. Burton called the suit "typical" of a trend for suits to be filed against companies with volatile stock prices following a decline in the stock price.
"We hope our actions will encourage other companies to stand their ground against these suits and eventually help reverse this trend," he said.
