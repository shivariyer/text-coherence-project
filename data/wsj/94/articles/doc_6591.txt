The Lazard investment banking group led European cross-border mergers and acquisitions deals in 1993, ahead of Deutsche Bank AG's Morgan Grenfell unit and Goldman, Sachs & Co. in second and third place respectively.
With 22 transactions totaling #4.8 billion ($7.2 billion), the combination formed by the three Lazard houses in London, Paris and New York, moved up from third place in 1992, according to Acquisitions Monthly, a trade publication.
Among the major deals, Lazard Freres et Cie. of Paris advised Union des Assurances de Paris on its 1.8 billion two-step bid for 73.6% of Vinci, a Dutch insurance and financial-services group.
Through this deal, UAP took control of Colonia Konzern AG, a German insurance company, in a cross-shareholder arrangement with Suez et Cie. of France.
In Britain, meanwhile, Lazard Bros. & Co. advised U.K. retailer Kingfisher PLC on its #1 billion acquisition of Financiere Darty SA of France.
Morgan Grenfell came second in the magazine's rating, with 44 completed transactions, the highest number of deals achieved by any adviser in the table, totaling 3.56 billion.
Goldman Sachs ranked third with 32 cross-border deals totaling 3.55 billion.
S.G. Warburg Group PLC, which led the magazine's 1992 ranking for cross-border deals, figured sixth in 1993 with 21 deals valued at 2.2 billion.
According to another recent ranking, published by Mergers & Acquisitions International, however, Warburg was top adviser for the second year running in all European deals, including domestic deals.
