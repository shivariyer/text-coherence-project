A Borden Inc. subsidiary said it plans to build a forest-products resins plant in Hope, Ark.
The adhesives and resins North America unit of Borden's packaging and industrial-products division said the new facility will serve the growing forest-products business in the region.
Borden is a leading supplier of resins used to make plywood and particleboard.
