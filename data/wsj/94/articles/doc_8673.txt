United Illuminating Co. said it will take a one-time charge of $7.8 million, or 56 cents a share, against fourth-quarter earnings as part of its "ongoing organization review".
The electric utility company, New Haven, Conn., said the charge reflects the cost of a voluntary early-retirement program and other restructuring costs.
The company also lowered its fourth-quarter operating earnings estimate, previously between 15 cents and 25 cents a share.
Final earnings will be released next week.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, United Illuminating closed at $37.25 a share, down $1.25.
