Mary Farrell, a market strategist at PaineWebber Inc., said the merger news showcases the attractiveness of smaller issues.
"In the 1980s mergers mostly involved big-cap companies and were done for financial-engineering reasons," Ms. Farrell said.

This is further evidence that small-cap stocks are undervalued."
