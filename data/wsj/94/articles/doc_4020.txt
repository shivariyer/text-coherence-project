Ira Magaziner and Robert Reich, both now influential in the Clinton administration, first reached a broad audience with their 1982 book on international competitiveness, "Minding America's Business."
The book advocated a U.S. industrial policy, and in the introduction the authors explained: "our standard of living can only rise if (i) capital and labor increasingly flow to industries with high value-added per worker and (ii) we maintain a position in those industries that is superior to that of our competitors."
Well, "Minding America's Business" never really justifies these criteria.
Nowhere does the book compare actual value-added per worker in different industries.
Such numbers are not hard to find.
The table, based on data in the Statistical Abstract of the United States, shows that the U.S. industries with really high value-added per worker are in sectors with very high ratios of capital to labor, like cigarettes and petroleum refining.
(This was predictable: Because capital-intensive industries must earn a normal return on large investments, they must charge prices that are a larger markup over labor costs than labor-intensive industries, which means that they have high value-added per worker.)
Among large industries, value-added per worker tends to be high in traditional heavy manufacturing sectors like steel and autos.
High-technology sectors like aerospace and electronics turn out to be only roughly average.
Surely Messrs. Magaziner and Reich were not calling for an industrial policy that would funnel capital and labor into the steel and auto industries in preference to high-tech.
How, then, could they write a whole book dedicated to the idea of targeting high value-added industries?
