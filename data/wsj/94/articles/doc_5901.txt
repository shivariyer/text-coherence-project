ASK Group Inc. said Pier Carlo Falotti, its president and chief executive officer, resigned for personal reasons.
Mr. Falotti, 51 years old, had been with the software concern since the summer of 1992.
Before that, he was president of Digital Equipment Corp.'s big European unit.
He had worked 23 years at Digital.
A spokeswoman said Mr. Falotti's unexpected resignation was due to "family considerations" but wouldn't elaborate.
She said the company didn't know of Mr. Falotti's professional plans, and that he wasn't available for comment.
Leslie Wright, 40, ASK's executive vice president and chief financial officer, was named acting operating officer, until a new chief executive is found.
For its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, Ask posted a net loss of $13.7 million, or 59 cents a share, compared to net income of $3.6 million or 16 cents a share a year earlier.
Revenue fell to $100.6 million from $113.5 million.
For the six months, Ask posted a net loss of $20.5 million, or 89 cents a share, on revenue of $184.5 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $197.3 million.
