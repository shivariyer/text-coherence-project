The Justice Department is expected to inform Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown this week that it hasn't found any evidence to support charges that he sought a bribe to influence U.S. policy toward Vietnam.
A letter from department officials to Mr. Brown probably will be sent within a few days, a Clinton administration official said.
Investigators weeks ago concluded there wasn't any basis for charging Mr. Brown, but top department officials wanted to be certain that all possibilities had been thoroughly checked before clearing the secretary.
Mr. Brown's sole accuser, Ly Thanh Binh, told reporters and federal agents that Mr. Brown wanted $700,000, plus oil and gas royalties, for his assistance in improving trade relations between the U.S. and Vietnam.
Mr. Binh was a business partner with Nguyen Van Hao, a former South Vietnamese official, who Mr. Binh said was the middleman between Mr. Brown and Vietnamese government authorities.
Mr. Brown acknowledged meeting with Mr. Hao on three occasions from November 1992 to January 1993, including once in the secretary's Commerce Department office.
Mr. Hao has denied Mr. Binh's allegations and Mr. Binh acknowledged that he had never talked to Mr. Brown and had no first-hand information that Mr. Brown improperly solicited Vietnamese business.
