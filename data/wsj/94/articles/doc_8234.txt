Southern Co., Atlanta, will take a onetime after-tax charge of $38 million in the first quarter, reducing per-share earnings 12 cents, to cover an early-retirement program at its Georgia Power Co. unit.
Georgia Power said it will offer the program to 445 workers and is aiming for a participation rate of at least 80%.
The company said it expects to recoup the costs in about two years through reduced salaries and benefits.
Georgia Power has trimmed its work force by 15% since 1988 to cut costs in the face of rising competition.
For the first quarter of 1993, the utility holding company, reported earnings of $177 million, or 56 cents a share, on revenue of $1.84 billion.
