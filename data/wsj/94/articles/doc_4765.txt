Intel Corp. increased its hold on the world microprocessor market last year, while rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. slipped in the race to supply the chips that run personal computers, according to a survey by Dataquest Inc.
The market-research company said Intel's already-commanding lead climbed to 74%, or $6.6 billion, of the market in 1993 from 69%, or $3.8 billion, in 1992.
The market itself grew 61% to $8.9 billion last year from $5.5 billion in 1992.
AMD fell to third with a 6% share compared with 10% and was the only producer in the top 10 whose revenue declined last year.
AMD was unable to increase production fast enough of its version of Intel's 486 chip to offset a drop in sales in the less powerful 386 chip.
Motorola Inc. moved up to second place although its share held at 8%.
Texas Instruments grabbed a 2% share, up from 1%.
Motorola also surpassed NEC Corp. in Japan, in the market for microcontrollers, which are used to control things like airbags in cars.
Motorola nabbed a 19% slice of that market in revenue, edging out NEC at 17%.
