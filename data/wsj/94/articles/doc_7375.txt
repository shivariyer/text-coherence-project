WordPerfect Corp. said it won't release any major new versions of its DOS word-processing program, one of the most popular pieces of software ever, citing a steep decline in sales.
WordPerfect, the last major software company to downgrade its DOS offerings in favor of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating environment, said it will only release "maintenance" versions of its DOS word processor in the future.
However, the closely held company promised to ensure that documents created by its DOS program work with its future word processors.
WordPerfect shipped a new DOS version last June and has sold 1.5 million copies since.
But in recent months sales have slowed considerably and are now "minuscule," compared with the Windows version of WordPerfect, a spokesman said.
The swing to Windows, a program that makes DOS easier to use and requires applications to be tailored to it, means tougher competition for WordPerfect.
Last year, WordPerfect lost its lead to Microsoft in the $1.3 billion annual market for wordprocessing software, partly because Microsoft pushed Windows programs harder and sooner.
