After some early market choppiness, small-company stock investors decided Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony was harmless and bid prices higher.

Market players showed caution as the testimony began, but they later tossed aside their concerns.

"The lack of any extraordinary comments one way or another from Greenspan really helped us," said Larry Kinney, head of over-the-counter trading at SoundView Financial Group.
"After some early indecision, we gained strength as he signaled the uptick in rates wouldn't occur right away."
Peter Coolidge, a senior equity trader at Kidder Peabody, said that after two down sessions, small-cap stocks were due for a bounce, but "the market was a little bit nervous, and nobody wanted to commit themselves until they could determine what Greenspan's comments and his actions would mean."
Although Mr. Coolidge said yesterday's action "did not validate the correction theory" that many analysts have put forth in the past few weeks, all in all the session doesn't have much effect because "there weren't a lot of players around."
