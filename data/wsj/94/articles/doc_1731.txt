Oshkosh B'Gosh Inc. said it terminated its negotiations to acquire Rio Sportswear Inc., a jeans maker that recently signed an agreement to buy the jeans business of Calvin Klein Inc.
"In the final analysis, we weren't able to reach an agreement as to the strategic direction of Rio going forward, and certainly Calvin Klein was a part of that," said David Omachinski, chief financial officer of Oshkosh B'Gosh, in Oshkosh, Wis.
He also disclosed that Oshkosh had planned to buy closely held Rio for "in the range of about $65 million."
New York-based Rio, with annual sales of more than $150 million, is "very intent" on completing the acquisition of Calvin Klein jeans for $35 million in the next few weeks, said Arnold Simond, Rio president.
"Everything is status quo.
We can handle the financing on our own.
Calvin Klein for me represents such a tremendous opportunity that I would turn down $65 million" from Oshkosh, he said.
