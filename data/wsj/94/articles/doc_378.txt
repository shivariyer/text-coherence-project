Baker Performance Chemicals Inc., a unit of Baker Hughes Inc., said it will shed its Mineral Handling Group.
Baker Performance said in Houston that it was selling the group to focus on its core specialty chemical businesses in the oil and gas industry.
The move is in keeping with the parent company's recent decision to concentrate on its core oil, gas and process industries.
The group has 55 employees based in four states and two manufacturing plants.
A spokesman said Baker Performance had revenue last year of less than $20 million.
The company said it hired Texas Commerce Bank of Houston to assist in the sale.
The mineral group markets dust suppressants and freeze-conditioning agents to the coal mining and mineral transportation industry.
THE MINERAL HANDLING GROUP of Baker Performance Chemicals Inc. had revenue last year of less than $20 million.
