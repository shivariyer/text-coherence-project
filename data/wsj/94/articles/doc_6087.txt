President Paul M. Brockman left the company, which said it expects to post a net loss in the fourth quarter because of lower-than-expected sales.
Hamburger Hamlet's chairman and chief executive officer, Thomas A. McFall, who assumes the additional title of president, said Mr. Brockman has left to "pursue other business opportunities."
Mr. Brockman couldn't be reached for comment.
David R. Fox, executive vice president, was named to the new post of chief operating officer.
