Bridgestone Corp. reported its consolidated pretax profit for 1993 tumbled 53% to 37.35 billion yen ($355.2 million), citing the domestic economy.
The automobile-tire maker reported its 1993 unconsolidated, or parent-only, pretax profit plunged 48% to 35.55 billion yen from a year earlier.
For 1994, the company predicts group pretax profit will total 50 billion yen, up 34% from 1993.
It expects parent pretax profit to rise 4.1% to 37 billion yen this year.
Bridgestone officials said the company expects to have an operating profit of roughly 52 billion yen for 1994, down about 2.5 billion yen from 1993.
Although the company plans to save 16 billion yen by cutting costs, an expected increase in the yen's value against the dollar is seen trimming the profit by 11 billion yen.
A drop in sales volume also is seen knocking 7.5 billion yen off operating profit.
The company assumes the U.S. dollar at 103 yen for 1994, down from 112 yen in 1993 and sharply below 127 yen in 1992.
A one-yen decline in the value of the dollar against the yen would cause the parent company's sales to fall by roughly 1.5 billion yen, based on the company's 1994 forecasts.
On the back of lower profit, Bridgestone will slash its capital investment to 22 billion yen for 1994 from 41.7 billion yen in 1993.
Of the total 1994 figure, 12 billion yen will cover the tire-production sector, while 2.5 billion yen will pay for product-processing facilities.
Investment in the research-and-development sector will slide to 5.5 billion yen from 6.6 billion yen.
Vice President Isao Imaizumi said its U.S. subsidiary, Bridgestone Firestone Inc., posted annual profit for the first time since it acquired U.S. tire-maker Firestone in 1988.
A recovery in the U.S. economy, as well as the company's efforts to rationalize its operations over the past years, contributed to the improved earnings, he said.
