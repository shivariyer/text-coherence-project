Hyde Athletic Industries Inc., citing a decline in sales of its leading brand of Saucony sneakers, reported a sharp decline in fourth-quarter net income.
The Peabody, Mass., athletic-footwear maker said net income was $276,004, or four cents a share, down from $1.9 million, or 36 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales fell 18% to $21.3 million from $26 million a year earlier.
The company said sales in its Saucony division fell 16%, to $13.2 million from $15.8 million a year earlier.
The brand apparently is coming off a boost received after one of its shoes was rated No. 1 in a running-shoe category by Consumer Reports magazine in May 1992.
Net income for 1993 was $4.6 million, or 76 cents a share, up 35% from a year-earlier $3.4 million, or 65 cents a share.
Sales for the full year increased 28% to $103.7 million from $81.3 million in 1992.
