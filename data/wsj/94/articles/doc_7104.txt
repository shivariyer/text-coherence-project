Transco Energy Co. said that a natural gas line belonging to its Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. unit in Rockville, Md., was punctured after it was struck by construction equipment.
A 12-mile section of the pipeline, located near Route 28 and Research Boulevard in Rockville, was shut down minutes after the incident yesterday morning, the company said.
There were no injuries, explosion or fire.
Although authorities evacuated businesses and residents, according to the Associated Press, they later reopened the area.
Transco said the pipeline was punctured by a backhoe working in the area.
The construction work was being performed by a third party on the company's right-of-way.
The broken line is one of four running through the area from the Gulf Coast and supplying much of the East.
Transco said repairs are expected to be complete this week.
The company said it doesn't anticipate any disruption in service because gas was rerouted to the other lines.
