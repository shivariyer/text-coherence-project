Genesco Inc., hurt by sluggish sales of clothing and footwear, said it will take a $38 million fourth-quarter charge for a restructuring that will include eliminating 1,400 jobs, or 20% of the company's work force.
The clothing and footwear manufacturer and retailer said the restructuring would reduce manufacturing capacity, corporate overhead and operating expenses.
As part of the restructuring, Genesco said it will close about 60 of its 530 retail shoe stores.
A spokeswoman said the company hasn't yet decided which of its 14 plants will be affected.
Genesco has three footwear chains -- Jarman, Johnston & Murphy and Journeys.
The Journeys chain, which sells shoes to the teenage market, has been the weakest performer, but the company hasn't yet determined which stores would be closed, the spokeswoman said.
Some of its footwear brands, such as Laredo western boots, have sold well in western-wear shops.
But others, such as Code West, a fashion boot sold in department stores, had weaker sales.
In apparel, Genesco blames the move toward more casual dress at the workplace for weaker sales of tailored clothing.
In the year-earlier period, ended Jan. 31, 1993, net income was $3.6 million, or 15 cents a share.
The quarter included a charge of $583,000, or two cents a share, from early retirement of debt.
Genesco said it revised its credit agreements with its banks, providing as much as $100 million to the company.
