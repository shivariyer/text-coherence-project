Andersen Consulting said its worldwide revenue rose 6% in 1993, boosted by strong growth in its telecommunications practice.
Revenue at the Chicago-based management and technology consulting concern totaled $2.88 billion, up from $2.72 billion a year earlier.
Of that figure, U.S. revenue totaled $1.41 billion, up 13% from $1.25 billion in 1992.
Revenue from telecommunications, Andersen's fastest-growing industry practice, rose 24% to $238 million.
George T. Shaheen, Andersen's world-wide managing partner, said the growth is fueled by the convergence of telephone, cable-TV and computer technologies.
Mr. Shaheen said Andersen also is seeing strong growth from helping companies "re-engineer" their operations.
