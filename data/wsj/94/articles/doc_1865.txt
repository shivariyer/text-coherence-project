Lockheed Corp. said its joint venture to sell Russian Proton rockets won a contract to launch multiple radio and television satellites for Societe Europeene des Satellites.
The value of the contract has been estimated at about $250 million.
The number of satellite launches involved for the Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International venture wasn't disclosed.
However, Russian and Lockheed officials said at a news conference that the enterprise has firm orders valued at about $600 million, including the new European contract.
Other launch contracts held by the venture include satellite launches for Loral Corp., and for Motorola Inc.'s Iridium communications satellite network.
Lockheed also is building parts of the 66-satellite Iridum constellation.
