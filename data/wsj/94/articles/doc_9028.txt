Adolph Coors Co. said its Coors Brewing Co. subsidiary reached record beverage sales volume for the year ended Dec. 26, 1993, of 19.8 million barrels, up 1.3% from the previous year's 19.6 million barrels.
The company said, however, that beer sales for its fourth quarter declined 3.6%, to 4.2 million barrels from 4.4 million barrels a year earlier.
The brewer blamed the drop on an anticipated reduction in distributor inventories in the quarter and an increase in distributor inventories in the year-earlier period.
Officials said Coors Brewing's sales volume isn't necessarily indicative of the financial performance of Adolph Coors.
