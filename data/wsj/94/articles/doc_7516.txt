Paramount Communications Inc. said both Viacom Inc. and QVC Network Inc. agreed to abide by Tuesday's deadline to submit their best and final takeover bids for Paramount.
In talks with takeover-stock traders this week, Viacom advisers indicated that unless both bidders agreed to honor the deadline, Viacom believed it would have been free to extend the bidding beyond the 5 p.m.
Feb. 1 cutoff.
Paramount said it wants to conclude the prolonged contest, which has already dragged into its fifth month, "in a timely manner."
Viacom's roughly $9.8 billion offer for Paramount trails the current market value of QVC's bid, worth about $10.2 billion.
But the Paramount board has endorsed Viacom's bid because it contains more cash and a security offering some extra value if Viacom's stock price doesn't appreciate.
Both Viacom and QVC have made cash-and-stock bids.
