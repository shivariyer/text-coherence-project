Sears, Roebuck & Co. is jumping into celebrity sponsorship with both feet.
The retailer said it will be a prime sponsor of the Stars & Stripes boat in the America's Cup races beginning in September, and this spring will begin selling an exclusive line of men's casual shoes and sportswear called Stars & Stripes.
Sears said the sponsorship results from agreements with Stride Rite Corp., the Cambridge, Mass., shoe maker, and Dennis Conner, the renowned skipper of the Stars & Stripes boat who also owns the Stars & Stripes logo.
The agreements add to the recent roster of celebrities and brand names that Sears is linking up with in an effort to boost sales and bolster its image.
Last month, Sears announced it would be the exclusive sponsor of Phil Collins's concert tour that begins in May.
But just how Sears will benefit through sponsoring an event such as the America's Cup, whose patrons' tastes are typically more upscale than the stores' apparel offerings, in unclear.
Sears says that while yachting may be a sport practiced mostly by the wealty, the America's Cup event has broad appeal, as do the patriotic themes associated with the boat and the race.
Sears will spend $3 million to become a "gold" sponsor of the apparel campaign.
As such its logo will appear from time to time on one of the boat's sails during the races.
Sears joins General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division as a Stars & Stripes sponsor.
