Russia assured other major aluminum-producing nations that it will implement planned production cuts to help reduce the world aluminum glut.
The assurance was disclosed yesterday, at the conclusion of a two-day meeting of officials from major aluminum producing nations, including the U.S., Russia, Canada, Australia, Norway and the European Union.
Russia, at a previous meeting in Brussels in late January, agreed to cut output by 300,000 metric tons immediately -- and by an additional 200,000 tons after similar cutbacks by Western producers.
Some industry observers had expressed doubts about Russia's ability to force its smelters to implement the proposed cuts.
But the Russian delegation in Ottawa said Moscow has at its disposal "the necessary legal means" to ensure that the necessary production cuts are made.
Canadian officials told reporters that since November, major aluminum producers, including Russia, had cut output by one million tons.
Russia had reduced production by 120,000 tons and announced its intentions to cut an additional 37,000 tons "in the very near future," officials said.
Western producers had announced cuts of 850,000 tons.
"There has been a very substantial number of cuts," said one official.
"We are not anticipating a major problem in reaching the goals that have been set out" in the Brussels agreement, he said.
The accord is aimed at reducing global production by up to two million tons over two years.
