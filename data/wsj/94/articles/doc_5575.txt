Your Jan. 21 page-one article concerning abuses by life insurance agents paints an unfair picture of a profession that has done more to sustain people than any other profession.
The life-insurance business is made up of people who consider the clients' needs and respond to them.
We all regret the existence of the bad apple, and have rules and regulations to respond to a situation when it is brought to the attention of the insurance carrier.
We are very conscious of our social responsibility, and I can say with pride that the agents I know have a degree of moral, social and fiscal responsibility to the client that is surpassed by no other profession.
