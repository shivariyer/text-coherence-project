KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said it intends to sell 51% of its majority-owned KLM Aerocarto BV map-making affiliate to Eurosense Group of Belgium.
Financial terms weren't disclosed.
The Dutch carrier said it will retain 9% of Aerocarto, with United Aerial Mapping Inc. of San Antonio holding onto its 40% stake.
KLM, which is 38.2% state-owned, said the disposal of the 51% stake in Aerocarto is in line with the company's strategy of shedding noncore operations.
Aerocarto has about 14.5 million guilders ($7.6 million) of revenue a year and is modestly profitable, KLM said.
