New Valley Corp. said it will amend its reorganization plan to ensure that all secured and unsecured creditors receive 100% of their allowed claims.
The amendment will be filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newark, N.J., as part of New Valley's proceedings under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
The original plan, filed Nov. 24, had proposed recoveries of as low as 51% for some creditor claims.
New Valley, the parent of Western Union Financial Service Inc., said the amendment was aimed at disgruntled creditors who had opposed the original plan.
"We want to get the deal done, and complete the reorganization," said a New Valley spokesman.
"We believe this is the way we can do it."
New Valley said the amended plan will require an additional $25 million in cash.
As part of the amended plan, New Valley said it will ask the court for permission to forgo post-petition interest payments to unsecured creditors.
In addition, New Valley said it will request a postponement of a court hearing scheduled Jan. 28 to consider the plan, due to the new filing.
