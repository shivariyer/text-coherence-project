Nynex Corp. plans to spend about $2.8 billion to build an interactive network across the Northeast that could connect up to two million homes and businesses by the end of 1996.
But Nynex stopped short of announcing a rollout for New York, the most lucrative potential U.S. market for new multimedia services, until it can win assurances of getting greater regulatory relief.
Instead, employing a carrot-and-stick approach with regulators, the telephone company said it will start its entry into the interactive era merely by constructing a 60,000-home system in Warwick, R.I.
Rhode Island is the only state in Nynex's service region that offers the free form of regulation the company seeks -- "incentive-based" rules that free the Baby Bells to hold on to more profit in exchange for freezing or holding down prices on monopoly services.
The older approach of "rate-of-return" regulation guarantees the Bells a certain level of profit, but it forces refunds when they surpass that cap.
"We aren't in the position to announce interactive plans in New York until we see what happens with the regulatory landscape," Richard Jalkut, president and chief executive officer of Nynex's New York unit, said in an interview.
"It's too risky under the current circumstances."
Nynex is the latest of the seven Baby Bells to announce its interactive plans.
Pacific Telesis Group, U S West Inc. and Bell Atlantic Corp., which is in the process of acquiring cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., have all announced aggressive plans to construct interactive networks across their territories.
