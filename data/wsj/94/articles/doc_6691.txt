Ross Stores Inc., citing increased fourth-quarter price competition, said it expects to report a decline of about 13% in fiscal 1994 earnings.
The Newark, Calif., discount retail chain said it expects to report profit of between $1.12 and $1.15 a share for the year ended Jan. 29.
Ross had net income of $34 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier.
The company will report earnings in March.
Norman Ferber, Ross's chairman and chief executive officer, said earnings declined because of competition among apparel retailers during the holiday season.
Ross said its January sales rose 14% to $56 million from $49 million a year ago.
Same-store sales for the period rose 5%.
For the fiscal year, sales were $1.12 billion, up 8% from $1.04 billion a year earlier.
