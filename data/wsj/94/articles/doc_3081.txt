McDonald's Corp. apparently isn't giving up on dinner.
Although it hasn't been successful in developing a separate dinner menu for its thousands of fast-food outlets, the company is considering what it calls "a test concept" of what is described as a sit-down family restaurant called Hearth Express.
The outlets reportedly will feature rotisserie chicken -- a hot item in the casual-dining industry these days -- as well as meat loaf and other traditional foods.
The Hearth Express test, scheduled for later this year, was first reported in Crain's Chicago Business.
A company spokesman confirmed that what he called a "test concept" was in the works but wouldn't elaborate.
McDonald's, the world's largest restaurant chain, typically has several tests of potential menu items under way at any given time, but few make it onto the company's U.S. menu.
McDonald's has tried the home-cooking concept before, without success.
In 1990 it opened a 1950s-style restaurant, called the Golden Arch Cafe, in Hartsville, Tenn.
Its menu included such traditional fare as pork cutlets and mashed potatoes and cole slaw, but the company abandoned that idea after more than a year.
