National City Corp. said its board authorized the purchase, in the open market or otherwise, of as many as five million additional shares of the company's common stock and any amount of depositary shares of its 8% cumulative convertible preferred stock.
The buyback program is subject to a combined purchase limit of $200 million, the bank holding company said.
National City said all common shares purchased will be held as treasury shares for reissue in connection with stock option plans, and used for general corporate purposes.
Any depositary shares of preferred stock acquired will be retired.
The stock repurchase program will begin after completion of an existing buyback program announced in December.
