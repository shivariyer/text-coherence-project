Movie distributor Savoy Pictures Entertainment Inc. said it will start a television-station group, in partnership with News Corp.'s Fox Television Stations Inc.
The new venture, SF Broadcasting LLC, will acquire U.S. television stations, seeking primarily to purchase affiliates of the Fox television network.
The group will start with $100 million in equity capital, which it said will allow it to invest as much as $500 million with borrowings.
Fox will provide 58% of the financing and Savoy will provide 41%.
The remaining 1% will come from a new corporation owned by Savoy principals Victor A. Kaufman and Lewis J. Korman, which will hold all voting interests in SF Broadcasting.
Mr. Korman, president and chief operating officer of Savoy, said the Fox network is poised for sharp growth.
He said Savoy will also look at other entertainment-related acquisitions, such as local sports teams, in areas where SF buys TV stations.
Thomas Herwitz, former vice president and general manager of Fox's Washington television station, WTTG, will be president and chief executive officer of the new venture.
Fox, which already owns eight stations, will have no management role in the new venture, to avoid any potential conflicts with federal rules limiting companies from owning more than 12 stations reaching 25% of the U.S.
