Swedish pulp and paper group Svenska Cellulosa AB, or SCA, said it won't proceed with its earlier-reported agreement to acquire an 89.8% stake in French packaging company Otor Holding SA unless it can also acquire the remaining 10.2% held by Stora Billerud, a subsidiary of Stora AB, Europe's largest forest-products group.
The announcement represents a change in SCA's position on the minority stake in Otor.
On March 18, SCA Chief Executive Sverker Martin-Loef denied the group had any immediate intention to take over Stora Billerud's holdings in Otor.
The total price for Otor would amount to the equivalent of 2.39 billion kronor ($302.8 million), SCA said previously.
The share issue will be considered by SCA shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on April 11 "should an agreement be reached with majority shareholders Jean-Yves Bacques and Stora Billerud within the near future," the group said.
