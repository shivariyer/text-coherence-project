Littlefield, Adams & Co. said it decided to cancel a marketing agreement with an operator of medical and chiropractic clinics, maintaining that the agreement had confused investors.
The move will force Littlefield, based in San Antonio, to reduce the earnings it reported for the first quarter of 1993 by $5.2 million, the company said.
Following the announcement, trading in Littlefield Adams shares resumed after being suspended for two days at the company's request.
Friday, the stock tumbled $3, or 15%, to $16.375 a share in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange.
Littlefield, a maker of sportswear and some medical products, said it decided to rescind its year-old agreement with Americare Health Group Inc., East Islip, N.Y.
Officials of Americare couldn't be reached for comment.
Its shares aren't widely traded.
