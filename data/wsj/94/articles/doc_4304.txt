The number of cellular-telephone lines in Brazil increased to more than 250,000 by the end of last year, Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras said.
The state-owned phone holding company said about 77% of the cellular-phone lines were created last year and that the total will increase to 600,000 this year.
Brazil has 12.7 million fixed telephone lines, or one for every 8.4 people.
As of January, 17 of Brazil's 27 states had cellular lines.
