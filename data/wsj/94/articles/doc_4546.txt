Labor Secretary Robert Reich said he plans to introduce a major worker-retraining program to Congress next month.
Mr. Reich told reporters that one of the hardest transitions Americans face is in moving from job to job.
His retraining proposal seeks to turn the unemployment insurance system into a re-employment system.
The labor secretary's comments came as President Clinton focused on training and education in a speech to the American Council on Education.
In pushing for his Goals 2000 legislation, Mr. Clinton said, "we enshrine the national education goals, establish national standards by which we can deter mine whether schools are meeting those goals, encourage grass-roots reforms and give the schools the flexibility and the tools they need to meet the goals."
