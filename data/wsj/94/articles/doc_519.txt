Diversified British trading company Inchcape PLC said 1993 pretax profit rose to 271.4 million ($406.7 million), up 8.5%.
The 1993 profit was hurt by the strength of the Japanese yen.
Sir David Plastow, chairman, said Inchcape was hurt by the strength of the yen and that 1993 was "even tougher than expected."
The company gets many of its products from Japan.
Despite encouraging signs in certain markets, Inchcape doesn't "expect any marked recovery in the business climate for the majority of our operations in 1994, nor can we rely on any significant improvement in the currency situation," he said.
