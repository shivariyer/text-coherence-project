Japan Airlines Co. is studying the government's official labor-adjustment fund as an "option" in its large-scale cost-cutting plan, a company spokesman said.
However, it hasn't decided whether to apply for the subsidy, which is paid by the government to cover part of the labor costs in struggling industries, he said.
He denied a Japanese newspaper report that JAL already has notified its labor union of its intention to apply for the fund.
