Associate Counsel William Kennedy III was reassigned within the White House legal department after acknowledging that he failed to make 1991 and 1992 Social Security payments on time for a child-care worker.
Mr. Kennedy had been in charge of reviewing the background checks of presidential nominees and potential employees to ensure they didn't pose security threats.
But this week, he said he paid about $2,000 in taxes and penalties for 1992 in January 1993.
And a few weeks ago, he paid $805 for his 1991 taxes.
Mr. Kennedy, former managing partner of the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., will perform other duties in the counsel's office, according to White House officials.
Another lawyer, Beth Nolan, will perform his old duties.
