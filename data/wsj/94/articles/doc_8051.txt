Looks like the Clinton health-care proposal has problems on defense.
Last week, House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski appeared before 35 Health Insurance Association of America members to warn them to end their TV ads in which a couple named "Harry and Louise" express misgivings about the Clinton plan.
"Your messages are becoming the Willie Horton commercials of the health-care campaign," Rosty pontificated.
But then Mr. Rostenkowski became all sweetness, telling HIAA members: "It's time to make a deal.
But making a deal implies a willingness to compromise.
It requires you to abandon the high-profile outside game you've become so good at and instead embrace an intense, but private, inside game."
Sounds like HIAA's campaign is having an impact.
It's hard to see why anyone, including the opponents of Clintoncare, would abandon an "outside" strategy just when it's moving the ball.
