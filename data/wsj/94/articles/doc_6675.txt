Blue Dolphin Energy Co. said it expects to report a pretax gain of $890,000 in the first quarter.
In the year-earlier quarter, the company had net income of $289,752, or one cent a share, on revenue of $979,000.
The results included a gain of $288,811.
The oil and natural gas company in Houston, said the 1994 gain results from its recent debt restructuring, which lowered its interest rate.
The company said it was able to retire the debt because it arranged a $10 million loan so it could retire and consolidate existing debt and finance future working-capital needs, including acquisition and development of assets.
