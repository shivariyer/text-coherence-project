From a brief filed by Mother Teresa this month asking the Supreme Court to hear a case involving Alexander Loce, who was convicted of trespassing when he tried to stop his fiancee from having an abortion.
America needs no words from me to see how your decision in Roe v.
Wade has deformed a great nation.
The so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women against men.
It has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships.
It has aggravated the derogation of the father's role in an increasingly fatherless society.
It has portrayed the greatest of gifts -- a child -- as a competitor, an intrusion, and an inconvenience.
It has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters.
And, in granting this unconscionable power, it has exposed many women to unjust and selfish demands from their husbands or other sexual partners.
Human rights are not a privilege conferred by government.
They are every human being's entitlement by virtue of his humanity.
The right to life does not depend, and must not be declared to be contingent, on the pleasure of anyone else, not even a parent or a sovereign.
