Standard & Poor's Corp. said it affirmed its triple-A claims-paying ability rating on Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association, a life-insurance company with assets of $67 billion.
S&P said its rating reflects TIAA's superior market position, solid earnings performance, excellent capitalization and the limited liquidity requirements of its liability structure.
Combined with its College Retirement Equities Fund affiliate, TIAA is the largest private retirement system in the nation, with assets of $128 billion at year-end 1993.
"Due to the company's market dominance and low cost structure, TIAA has continued to enjoy strong operating performance.
Return on assets increased to 0.79% in 1993 from 0.44% in 1991 due to the company's active dividend management, despite the declining interest-rate environment," S&P said.
The report noted, however, that TIAA has substantial investments in mortgages and real estate, and a high, though declining, proportion of noninvestment-grade issues in its bond portfolio.
The company's strong capital base and the long maturity of its annuities offset substantial long-term risk, S&P added.
