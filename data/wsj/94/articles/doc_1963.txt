A positive inflation report sparked a rally in bond prices.
Stock prices and the dollar were mixed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 13.39 points to 3849.59, and Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index slipped 0.38 to 467.01; but the Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.72 to 793.52.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond jumped more than 7/8 of a point, driving the yield down to 6.87% from 6.95% Monday.
Bond prices surged following the release of data showing that wholesale prices in February rose 0.5%, slightly above expectations; excluding food and energy, the increase was just 0.1%, below analysts' forecasts.
Analysts said bond prices benefited from a considerable shift among traders to bond futures from S&P futures.
But a report showing an increase in capacity utilization raised some warning flags about inflation, analysts added.
That data is regarded by some as more important than the price indexes because it suggests future trends while the indexes assess past conditions.
Stock prices flagged as investors remained cautious.
Some insurance companies and banks that have large investment management divisions rose on the heels of GE Capital Corp.'s takeover bid for Kemper Corp.
Insurance companies and banks also were aided by yesterday's drop in interest rates.
World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.14 to 116.04.
Stock prices were mixed.
Volume totaled 303.3 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,138 issues rose and 1,000 fell.
Bond prices rallied.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue gained more than 7/8 of a point, or more than $8.75 for each $1,000 face amount.
The dollar was mixed.
In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.6965 marks and 106.00 yen, compared with 1.6900 marks and 106.10 yen Monday.
