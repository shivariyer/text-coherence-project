Stocks advanced as bond prices climbed amid a smooth government note auction.
The dollar fell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 25.89 points to 3931.92.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index climbed 1.72 to 472.77, and the Nasdaq Composite Index surged 3.83 to 786.53.
Even the Dow Jones Utility Average joined the rally, adding 0.93 to 218.96.
"Overall it was a very good day," said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads a consulting firm that bears his name.
He said there were some concerns in the morning that U.S. stocks would fare poorly, considering the declines in overseas markets.
But those fears were overblown.
Mr. Birinyi said strong earnings from such companies as Goodyear Tire & Rubber, together with a stable bond market, helped to mitigate the worries about weakness abroad.
Though stocks started the day higher, the rally only took off in the afternoon when it became clear that the Treasury's $12 billion auction of 10-year notes had gone off without a hitch.
On Tuesday, lackluster demand for the government's three-year note auction had sent the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond to the highest level since August and put pressure on stocks.
But a drop in oil prices yesterday paved the way for healthy demand at the government's note sale.
Wayne Nordberg, a partner at Lord Abbett, which manages about $6 billion in stock assets, said investors were flocking to areas of the market that have an "economic tail wind," while avoiding those sectors that have an "interest rate head wind."
Thus, economically sensitive stocks such as AlliedSignal, Aluminum Co. of America and General Electric continued to outperform financial stocks yesterday, and helped to power the industrial average to a double-digit gain.
He said investors are recognizing that those companies that have an economic tail wind "are going to be able to report sufficient earnings growth to overcome this modest backup in interest rates."
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index lost 0.23 to 115.96.
Stock prices rose.
Volume was 322.6 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,289 issues rose and 850 fell.
Bond prices gained.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue rose more than 1/2 point, or more than $5 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.40%.
The dollar weakened.
In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.7585 marks and 108.35 yen, compared with 1.7640 marks and 108.75 yen Tuesday.
