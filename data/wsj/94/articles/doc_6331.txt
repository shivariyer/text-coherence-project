Westcoast Energy Inc. said it plans to spend about 74 million Canadian dollars ($55.1 million) this year expanding parts of its British Columbia gas-pipeline system.
A spokesman for the Vancouver, British Columbia, pipeline and gas-distribution company estimated that two phases of the project, slated for completion by year end, will cost C$55 million and C$19 million respectively.
Westcoast said it plans to build the new gas-transportation facilities in Northeastern British Columbia, near a number of large recent natural-gas discoveries.
Westcoast plans to file a regulatory application for the expansion within the next two weeks, the spokesman said.
