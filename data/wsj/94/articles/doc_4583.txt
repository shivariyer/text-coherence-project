Federal safety investigators have opened an inquiry into Honda Motor Co.'s Acura NSX sports cars, after receiving eight complaints that their rear tires wear out quickly.
Some NSX owners have reported their tires wore out after less than 5,000 miles, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Replacement tires as well as the original tires, made by Yokohama Tire Corp., allegedly wear down quickly, the safety agency said.
Agency officials wouldn't speculate on what could cause the tires to wear out quickly.
A NHTSA spokesman said none of the eight complaints concerned replacement tires.
But members of an NSX owners club reported similar wear patterns on replacement tires.
The safety agency spokesman said no problems have been reported with Yokohama tires on other high-performance cars.
Kelly Teenor, a spokeswoman for Yokohama Tire, said the tires were designed for high-performance cars and "continue to deliver what they were designed to deliver," including quick steering response and high traction.
The company, based in Fullerton, Calif., is a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Yokohama Rubber Co. Ltd.
A spokeswoman for American Honda Motor Co., which distributes the Acura NSX, said, "We think they're the right tires for the vehicle."
She added that premature wear "may have something to do with the way people drove the car."
The inquiry, opened Jan. 28 and reported in Tuesday's New York Times, concerns just 3,500 vehicles, and is still only a preliminary evaluation.
It is unusual for the NHTSA to investigate tire wear, but an agency spokesman said tires can be a safety problem if they go bald without the driver's knowledge.
The fenders of the low-slung NSX shield much of the rear tires from view, according to NHTSA, which has stated that "owner inspection of the tires without lifting the vehicle is very difficult."
According to the agency, the eight complaints about the NSX included two reports of injury-causing accidents, neither one fatal.
