U.S. Banknote Corp., New York, was named in a shareholder suit in the wake of its loss of U.S. Postal Service printing work.
A lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan alleges that the New York company failed to warn shareholders that its Postal Service contract was at risk.
U.S. Banknote, North America's largest private security-printing company, received no orders in the most recent round of contracts, valued at as much as $330 million over five years.
The lawsuit seeks class-action status for those who bought U.S. Banknote common stock between April 1993 and Jan. 6, 1994, the day the company announced that the Postal Service contract would be split among four competitors.
The news hammered the company's stock price.
The company declined to comment on the lawsuit.
The suit also alleges that Morris Weissman, chairman and chief executive officer, had an incentive to keep U.S. Banknote's stock price artificially high because of terms on an employment contract tied to the stock price.
