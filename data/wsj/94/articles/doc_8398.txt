United Kingdom chemicals concern BOC Group PLC said it will make an #85-million ($126.9 million) provision for the year ending Sept. 30, 1994.
BOC added that some 1,700 jobs will be lost.
It didn't say when these cuts would take place.
Commenting on the restructuring plans, company Chief Executive Officer Pat Dyer told the annual meeting: "In effect, this is spending money to save money -- a one-time cost to achieve considerable savings year after year into the future."
The company said the payback on the provision will begin in the current year and "within three years will lead to savings of almost #60 million a year."
BOC said current business was in line with expectations, but that signs of economic improvement are limited.
BOC said profits in health care would continue to be depressed by the effect of generic competition for its Forane anaesthetic in the U.S., but that its replacement drug, Suprane, was progressing well.
BOC also said that Patrick Rich plans to step down from his post of chairman at the begining of April, shortly after his 63rd birthday, partly because of health reasons.
The board expects to make a decision on a successor "soon."
Mr. Rich, who has worked for BOC for 11 years, had been chairman and chief executive until late last year, when the roles were split and Pat Dyer was named to the chief executive spot.
