British supermarket operator Tesco PLC said that it is in talks to invest about #12 million ($17.9 million) in Global TH, a major Hungarian regional chain that operates 43 stores with a total of 100,000 square feet.
"This investment by Tesco, although small, will provide the company with a stake in a developing market. . .," the company said.
Tesco said it will subscribe for shares in Global as "part of a capital-raising exercise," which will be done at the same time as the company's flotation on the Budapest Stock Exchange.
The flotation is expected to take place in mid-April as part of the government's privatization program.
After this, Tesco said it will control 45% of Global's shares.
