CitFed Bancorp Inc., Dayton, Ohio, expects that strong home building, along with higher fee revenue from growing consumer-banking and mortgage-banking businesses, will contribute to sharply higher earnings for its fourth quarter ending March 31.
The financial-services concern's management doesn't quarrel with analysts' forecasts of a rise of about 20% in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, said Jerry L. Kirby, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
In fiscal 1993, CitFed earned $8.6 million, or $2.03 a share.
Analysts project earnings of $2.50 a share for the current fiscal year.
That estimate indicates fourth-quarter net of 63 cents a share, compared with 52 cents a year earlier.
Earnings will reflect higher fee revenue from mortgage banking, trust accounts and checking accounts, officials said.
In addition, loan-loss provisions will drop to between $600,000 and $750,000, from $2.7 million a year earlier, they said.
CitFed's largest unit is Citizens Federal Bank, a savings bank with assets of $1.83 billion, as of Dec. 31.
