Immunex Corp. said that it has settled a shareholder class-action lawsuit, which alleged violations of securities law, for $14 million.
The Seattle biopharmaceutical company said $10 million of the settlement will be covered by insurance with another $4.4 million taken as a charge to previously released fourth-quarter earnings, resulting in an increased net loss of $10.5 million, or 27 cents a share, on revenue of $42.4 million.
The settlement, subject to court approval, stipulates that the concern does not admit any wrongdoing.
The suit alleged that the company made false statements or withheld information.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Immunex closed at $16, up 25 cents.
