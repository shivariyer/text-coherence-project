Komag Inc. restated its previously announced fiscal fourth-quarter results to show a wider loss per share.
But the total net loss for the period remains unchanged.
The Milpitas, Calif., computer hard-disk supplier's restated loss for the fourth quarter ended Jan. 2 was $29.7 million, or $1.37 a share, after a restructuring charge of $35.4 million, or $1.64 a share.
The per-share figures are based on 21.6 million shares outstanding.
Komag had reported a net loss of $1.35 a share, based on 22 million shares outstanding.
Komag's chief financial officer, William Potts Jr., said the company erroneously included common-share equivalents related to stock options when it first calculated its results.
Separately, Komag said it obtained waivers or amendments to loan covenants covering $44 million of debt.
Last month, the company said that, as a result of its restructuring charge, it was in violation of its loan covenants.
