Japan's average monthly household spending in 1993 rose 0.5% from a year earlier, to 335,246 yen ($3,163), a government agency reported.
Adjusted for inflation, however, the average monthly spending by households nationwide was down 0.6%, the first decline since a 0.8% slide for 1981, the agency said.
