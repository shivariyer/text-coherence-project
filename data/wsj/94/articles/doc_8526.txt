Genentech Inc., riding the resurgence of its heart attack drug Activase, said fourth-quarter earnings tripled to $18.7 million, or 16 cents a share, from $6.2 million, or five cents a share, a year earlier.
The biotech company's performance, which hit the high end of Wall Street forecasts, did little to stir its stock, though.
Genentech was quoted in late New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $50.50, up 25 cents.
Revenue rose 14% to $161.5 million from $142 million.
For the full year, Genentech's profit surged to $58.9 million, or 50 cents a share, from $20.8 million, or 18 cents a share.
Revenue rose 19% to $649.7 million from $544.3 million.
The company cited Activase's 30% sales growth, which propelled the drug to a two-thirds market share after its performance in a large clinical trial by heart attack patients last year.
Genentech President G. Kirk Raab said he expects profit growth to continue in 1994, as the company begins to realize sales from two new products recently granted market approval by the Food and Drug Administration: Pulmozyme for cystic fibrosis, and Nutropin for growth problems due to kidney failure.
Separately, Genentech said a federal court in San Francisco dismissed a longstanding patent lawsuit by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. against Genentech and its licensee Miles Inc.
In a 1983 lawsuit, Rhone-Poulenc's predecessor Rorer Group Inc. charged Genentech's gene-spliced version of a blood-clotting substance known as Factor VIII violated a Scripps Institute patent covering natural, plasma-derived Factor VIII which was licensed to Rorer.
The lawsuit's dismissal -- clearing the way for Genentech to receive royalties on Factor VIII sales -- follows a recently reported settlement of the dispute with Rorer and Scripps by Genentech and Miles, a unit of Germany's Farbenfabriken Bayer GmbH.
