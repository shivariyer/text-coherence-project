Hundreds of thousands of calls recently flooded Capitol Hill switchboards to protest a bill that would have required all teachers, including those in private schools and parents who home school, to be state-certified.
One office we spoke with reported it received nearly 1,000 calls from the district.
Nearly one million Americans teach their children at home.
Many do so because they can't afford private schools, but refuse to expose their children to public schools they see as plagued by violence or a lack of vigorous standards.
Not one of the 50 states now requires home-schooling parents to be certified.
After hearing from their constituents, the House voted 374 to 53 in favor of an amendment by Rep. Dick Armey banning federal regulation of home schools.
Sounds as if home-schooling parents not only taught their children last week, but gave a stern lecture to Members of Congress as well.
