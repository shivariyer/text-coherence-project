Home Shopping Network Inc., in a move to clear up some litigation stemming from a scandal last year, said it reached out-of-court settlements of several lawsuits by shareholders and would incur a related charge of $13 million to $16 million.
The St. Petersburg, Fla., television home-shopping company said it would take the charge in the fourth quarter, but didn't project results for that period.
A spokeswoman couldn't be reached for comment.
Most of the lawsuits covered by the settlements were sparked by a gale of charges and federal investigations into accusations that Home Shopping's founder, Roy M. Speer, and others engaged in wrongdoing involving the company's purchasing operations.
Among other things, Mr. Speer and colleagues were said to have held secret stakes in the company's vendors, paid hush money to silence would-be whistle-blowers and received kickbacks from suppliers.
A federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., and the Securities and Exchange Commission are conducting investigations into the allegations.
Yesterday, Home Shopping said it reached an agreement in principle to settle nine suits that were filed last April in federal court in Tampa.
The suits accused Home Shopping of failing to fully disclose the problems.
Under the settlement, which must be approved by the court, Home Shopping would contribute $8.6 million of a fund totaling $9.6 million.
The company didn't say who would contribute the rest.
In another settlement, the company said Mr. Speer agreed to pay the company $2 million.
As part of the same settlement, the company agreed to pay $4.5 million to Western Hemisphere Sales Inc. in exchange for, among other things, releasing Home Shopping from a 1985 license pact with Western Hemisphere's predecessor.
Home Shopping also settled two class action suits filed in federal and state court in Delaware.
Terms of those settlements weren't provided.
