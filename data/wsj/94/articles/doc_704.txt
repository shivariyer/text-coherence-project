Convex Computer Corp., Richardson, Texas, said it agreed in principle to settle a class-action lawsuit filed in August 1991.
As a result of the settlement, the supercomputer maker said it restated its 1993 fourth-quarter and full-year results for an additional charge of $2.5 million, or 10 cents a share.
Fourth-quarter results were restated to a loss of $15.7 million, or 62 cents a share.
On Feb. 4, the loss was reported as $13.2 million, or 52 cents a share.
Full-year results were restated to a loss of $63.8 million, or $2.53 a share, from $61.3 million, or $2.43 a share.
The company said it "vigorously denies" any violation of state or federal laws in relation to the settlement.
The suit alleged Convex misled investors about low demand for its C3 computer line.
