Shareholders of Goldcorp Inc., Dickenson Mines Ltd., and CSA Management Ltd. approved a reorganization of the three companies, including the merger of most of their assets.
CSA, a holding company controlled by Canadian mining executive Robert McEwen, currently controls Goldcorp, which controls Dickenson, a Toronto gold producer.
Mr. McEwen said the reorganization is aimed at simplifying the structure of the companies, improving the valuation of their assets, improving shareholder liquidity and making financing easier.
The merged assets will be held by Goldcorp, which will continue to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and will seek a listing on the American Stock Exchange.
Mr. McEwen will continue to control CSA, which will own 18% of the equity of Goldcorp.
Dickenson will no longer exist.
The reorganization is subject to regulatory clearance.
