The Municipal Securities Rule-making Board finally unveiled its proposed rule to end "pay-to-play" political gifts by municipal bond dealers, and depicted the controversial rule as immune from constitutional challenge.
"The board wishes to sever any connection between contributions and municipal securities business," the MSRB said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It said problems associated with political gifts to state and local officials "undermine investor confidence in the municipal securities market."
The MSRB, a self-regulatory body subject to SEC oversight, said it believes there have been "numerous instances" where dealers have won business based on their political contributions.
The SEC, which must approve the rule before it goes into effect, will ask for public comments for 21 days after the proposal is published in the Federal Register, an SEC spokeswoman said.
SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt commended the board for its work and said he looks forward to reviewing the rule and public response to it.
The SEC's fast-track comment period angered critics of the proposed rule.
Milton Wells, director of federal relations for the National Association of State Treasurers, called a 21-day comment period "totally insufficient," given the seriousness of the constitutional and other questions posed by the proposed rule.
The rule would bar a dealer from doing business with a bond-issuing jurisdiction within two years after any contribution is made to officials of the jurisdiction.
The rule covers contributions by the dealer, by any of its municipal finance professionals, or by any political action committee controlled by the dealer or its muni professionals.
An exception would allow muni professionals to contribute up to $250 to candidates in races where they can vote.
It would cover gifts made on or after April 1, 1994.
