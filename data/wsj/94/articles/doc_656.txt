Koll Real Estate Group Inc. said it has been told by the U.S. Tax Court that it must pay about $21 million to settle what the company called "an alleged tax deficiency."
A Koll spokesman said the liability was incurred by a subsidiary that was sold by a predecessor company to Koll.
"We have carried the liability on our books since 1989," he said, adding that it is "the subject of various tax-sharing agreements to which Koll and others are parties."
Koll, a real-estate investment and property management company, is evaluating the settlement and potential sources of financing, the spokesman said.
