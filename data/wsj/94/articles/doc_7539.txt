Authentic Fitness Corp. said it plans to reduce its annual interest expense by $800,000, or five cents a share, by refinancing a $100 million credit facility with a new $100 million credit facility.
The sportswear maker said the new loan will bear interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, plus 1%, reduced from Libor plus 2.75% on its current loan.
