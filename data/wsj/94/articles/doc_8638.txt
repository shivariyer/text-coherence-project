International Colin Energy Corp. said a recent gas discovery in northeastern British Columbia tested at 16 million cubic feet a day.
The oil and gas producer said the discovery well, in which it holds a 73% interest, cost 1.6 million Canadian dollars (US$1.2 million) to drill.
The company said it has applied for a pipeline permit and hopes to begin construction within two weeks, and that it plans to connect the well to British Columbia's gas transportation network by the end of March.
International Colin said it plans to drill as many as three more wells in the Adsett area of British Columbia, near the new discovery well, and that it plans to buy more land there.
