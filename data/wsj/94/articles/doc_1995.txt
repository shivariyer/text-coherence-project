American Express Co.
Chairman Harvey Golub received compensation of $7.3 million last year, his first year as chairman and chief executive, according to the company's proxy.
Last year, American Express staged a strong comeback under Mr. Golub's leadership.
The financial-services concern sold its Shearson retail brokerage division and additional stakes in First Data Corp.
Earnings at Travel Related Services division rebounded sharply in 1993, driven by fewer bad debts and cost-cutting measures.
Earlier this year the company announced it would shed its Lehman Brothers investment banking arm to concentrate on its flagship TRS business.
In addition, the proxy confirmed speculation that the company incurred a $5.2 million loss when it paid for Mr. Golub to relocate from Minnesota.
The loss came as a result of reselling his home, which had still been under construction when Mr. Golub was reassigned.
The company also paid $780,000 to a relocation service.
Mr. Golub's compensation included a salary of $776,923, up from $650,000 in 1992, as well as a bonus of $1,850,000, more than double the $900,000 he received in 1992, when he was president of the company and chairman of TRS.
He received $3,390,000 in restricted stock awards.
In addition to his $7.3 million in compensation, Mr. Golub was also awarded 400,000 options, with an exercise price of $28.25 each, that have a present value of about $2.8 million.
One-third of them can be exercised beginning next year, and the remaining two-thirds in 1996 and 1997.
