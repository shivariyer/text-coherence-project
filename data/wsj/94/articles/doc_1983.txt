SCEcorp agreed in principle to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of electricity from an independent wind-power company, ending a stalemate over the future of such alternative-energy projects in California.
But unlike state-imposed proposals calling for more rapid construction of generating plants, SCE said most of the power wouldn't be available until the end of the decade.
The utility also said a portion of the purchase contracts envisioned under its proposal is subject to prior approval of its cutomers.
The move by the utility, which signed a preliminary agreement to buy as much as 750 megawatts of power from San Francisco-based Kenetech Corp., follows a bitter fight over who will build new generating capacity in California.
The proposed plants would cost a total of about $750 million.
SCE's announcement came the day before state utility regulators are slated to consider ordering the giant utility to sign long-term supply contracts with independent producers.
By moving on its own to acquire about 60% of the renewable energy capacity required by the state, SCE hopes to persuade regulators to refrain from mandating additional purchases.
