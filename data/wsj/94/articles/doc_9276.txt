Optical Radiation Corp.'s share price rose nearly 10% in heavy trading after an investment group led by Benson Eyecare Corp. said it has acquired a 6.2% stake in the Azusa, Calif., company.
Benson, a Rye, N.Y., marketer of ready-to-wear glasses, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it approached Optical about a "possible friendly business combination" in July.
But after several discussions, Optical "indicated that it wasn't in a position to consider an offer for the company at this time," the filing said.
Optical Radiation produces precision optical surgical products and is an eyeglass wholesaler.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Optical's stock rose $1.50, or 9.7%, to close at $17 a share in heavy trading.
Gary Patten, Optical Radiation's chief financial officer, said, "We don't want to comment until we've read the SEC filing."
The company also said late yesterday in a statement that it hasn't held merger negotiations with Benson.
