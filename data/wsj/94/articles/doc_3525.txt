Oracle Corp. is expected to announce today that it won a contract to supply British Telecommunications PLC with software and systems integration needed to beam multimedia services into British homes.
Oracle declined to comment on the contract, but people close to the deal say the software maker will supply British Telecommunications with an array of products, from television set-top boxes to the multimedia information server that will channel video, audio and textual data into the home.
The pact is thought to include consulting services and a number of software products, such as Oracle Media Server, a multimedia library that stores and retrieves video, audio and textual data.
Also included is Oracle Media Objects, software used in the televised presentation of such services as movies on demand or home shopping.
In addition, Oracle Media Net will link consumers with the media server delivering the requested services.
Oracle has pushed hard to establish its software products as the standard tools for ferrying data along the information superhighway.
The British Telecommunications contract will be Oracle's third major telecommunications alliance in less than a year.
Last May, Oracle, struck a pact with U S West Inc. of Denver to supply information services based on the Oracle Media Server.
In January, Bell Atlantic Corp. of Arlington, Va., tapped Oracle software and consulting services for its planned interactive business.
