Eastman Kodak Co.
Chairman George Fisher plans to expand the company's electronic imaging business through joint ventures with U.S. computer companies.
Kodak will restructure its core imaging division within three months to implement a new focus on electronic technology, said Mr. Fisher, who joined Kodak Dec. 1 after leading Motorola Inc. to the forefront of wireless electronic technology.
The alliances should be set by the end of the year and although he named no one specific, Mr. Fisher said there would not be "one master partner."
Mr. Fisher also said that he would go outside the company for a few key leaders to direct the digital side of imaging.
"We need to separate the two," he said.
"There's been too much fear that the new technology would kill the old business."
Yet, he said, Kodak will keep one person to which both sides will report.
