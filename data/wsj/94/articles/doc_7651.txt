Stock prices rolled to highs as interest rates fell.
Bond prices soared and the dollar fell.
Smashing through the record set Jan. 21, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 18.30 points to 3926.30.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index jumped 3.85 to 477.05, also a high, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 4.08 to 792.88.
Stock analysts said news of a sharp drop in jobless claims and a healthy gain in durable goods orders in December helped to set the stage for a rally in economically sensitive stocks.
But the real trigger for the advance was falling interest rates.
Yesterday, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond slipped to 6.26% from 6.30% and gold prices, considered by many to be a hedge against inflation, fell sharply.
More importantly, the Dow Jones Utility Average, seen by some as a leading indicator of interest rates, rose for the second straight day.
The index of 15 blue-chip stocks surged 4.15 points to 225.61, its biggest single-day gain in three years.
"The fact that utilities have rebounded has made people feel better, the fact that the financial stocks have come back has made people feel better, and the fact that the S&P is keeping pace with the Dow's advance is encouraging to investors," said Steven Einhorn, stock strategist at Goldman Sachs.
Meanwhile, William Dodge, chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter Reynolds, said he was heartened to see that yesterday's advance was broad-based.
"Cyclicals were up, financials did well and even some growth stocks like PepsiCo had a good day," he said.
World-wide, stock prices gained in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index added 1.01 to 115.45.
Stock prices rallied.
Volume totaled 346.3 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,392 issues rose and 784 fell.
Bond prices rose.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue added 5/8 point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
The dollar weakened.
In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.7295 marks and 108.55 yen, compared with 1.7450 marks and 110.05 yen Wednesday.
