Seagull Energy Corp. said its 1994 capital budget will jump 54% to $173 million from $112 million in expenditures for 1993.
Seagull, an oil and natural-gas company, said both numbers exclude property acquisitions.
The company said it will increase spending for exploitation to $100 million from $64 million, for exploration to $50 million from $26 million, for lease acquisition to $10 million from $8 million and for corporate expenditures to $3 million from $2 million.
Spending for its Alaskan gas utility and its southwestern U.S. gas-pipeline and gathering systems will drop to $10 million from $12 million in 1993.
