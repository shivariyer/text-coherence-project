In your Feb. 1 Tracking Travel column, the item "Expanded Air Access for the Disabled Sought" states that "Paralyzed Veterans of America concedes that it wouldn't make sense" for the Air Carrier Access Act to apply to planes with 18 or fewer seats.
PVA certainly recognizes the difficulty in gaining access to very small commercial planes, but does believe the Air Carrier Access Act should apply.
Mechanical boarding devices that are the subject of referenced rule-making at the Transportation Department can provide access to many smaller planes as well.
PVA believes that if a passenger with a mobility impairment can board safely, the carrier must provide that person with transportation.
Additionally, the Air Carrier Access Act goes far beyond the requirement to assist people with mobility impairments in boarding.
It is a broad prohibition against disability-based discrimination in the provision of air transportation.
As such, it applies to all air carriers providing air transportation.
Only when this act is properly implemented will people with disabilities be able to fly without fear of discrimination.
