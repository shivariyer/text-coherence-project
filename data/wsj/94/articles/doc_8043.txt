Conductus Inc. said it delivered a scanning magnetic microscope to Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.'s basic research laboratory in Japan.
In a news release, the company said the microscope allows users to map currents flowing on or beneath the surface of electronic devices and materials.
The company said NTT bought the microscope to study weak electric currents within semiconducting samples.
Other potential applications include the mapping of magnetic media and the mapping of currents flowing in integrated circuits.
Conductus also said it got a patent on Jan. 18 for a method of preparing electronic structures containing multiple superconductor layers.
