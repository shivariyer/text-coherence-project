U.S. Bioscience Inc. posted a substantially widened loss for the fourth quarter, reflecting a $10.2 million charge for litigation settlement.
The West Conshohocken, Pa., drug developer concentrating on cancer and AIDS products said the loss was $19.3 million, or 49 cents a share, compared with a loss of $6.8 million, or 17 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
The latest quarter's figure included a provision for settling a shareholder class action, which alleged the company made misleading statements on the likelihood of a product gaining rapid government approval.
The company said its insurers will pay for $5 million of the $15 million total cost.
Revenue, including sales and investment and licensing income, fell to $1.2 million from $2 million a year earlier.
For the year, the company reported a net loss of $40.6 million, or $1.03 a share, nearly double the loss of $20.2 million, or 51 cents share, in 1992.
Revenue was $8.2 million, compared with $11.4 million.
