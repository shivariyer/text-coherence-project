Petersburg Long Distance Inc. said Navona Communications Corp. conditionally agreed to invest up to $38 million in Petersburg, which invests in telecommunications in the former Soviet Union.
Clayton Waite, senior vice president of Toronto-based Petersburg, said it will use the funds to raise its stake in a joint-venture telecommunications company in St. Petersburg, Russia, and to buy an interest in its local partner.
Details of those transactions haven't yet been completed.
If the full $38 million is invested, Navona will receive the equivalent of 4,180,000 common shares of Petersburg, at an indicated price of $9.09.
In trading yesterday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Petersburg closed at $10 a share, up 25 cents.
Petersburg said Novona will hold as much as 39.9% of its shares once this and certain previous agreements are completed.
Navona is a Bermuda holding company.
The transaction is subject to shareholder approval.
