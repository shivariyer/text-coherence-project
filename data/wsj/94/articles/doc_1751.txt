T. Marshall Hahn Jr., who retired as chairman of Georgia-Pacific Corp. in December, received 162,000 shares of company stock that he had accumulated from 1988 through 1993, according to the company's 1994 preliminary proxy statement.
The stock awards, part of two long-term incentive plans tied to company stock-price increases, were accompanied by $9.7 million worth of tax payments by the company on behalf of Mr. Hahn.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Georgia-Pacific stock closed at $68.50 a share, up $1.25, giving the 162,000 shares an indicated value of $11.1 million.
Ordinarily, such stock awards "would have been spread out over a number of years," said a company spokeswoman, "but they became vested all at once because of his retirement."
She emphasized that the stock awards were predicated on company stock-price increases in a plan approved by shareholders.
In 1993, Mr. Hahn earned a salary of $1.4 million, a bonus of $500,000 and long-term incentive plan payouts of $1.4 million.
His retirement package includes the provision of an office and secretarial service for as long as 10 years.
Georgia-Pacific estimates that benefit to be worth $581,000.
A.D. "Pete" Correll, Mr. Hahn's successor as chairman and chief executive officer, earned $816,667 in salary, $550,000 in bonuses and $1.4 million in long-term incentive payouts in 1993.
In addition, Mr. Correll received new long-term incentive-plan allocations of 140,000 company shares, which can be earned incrementally only if Georgia-Pacific's stock price hits certain targets, ranging from $71.76 a share to $128.52 a share.
