The Securities and Exchange Commission might issue a special report on the findings of its inquiry into the role of political contributions in the municipal-bond market, according to SEC Commissioner Richard Roberts.
Mr. Roberts also said the agency will address the issue in an interpretative release spelling out muni-disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws.
Mr. Roberts said the SEC's enforcement staff "has collected a great deal of information concerning this issue" and continues to review and analyze the data.
The agency, as reported, has obtained reams of data from some 70 securities firms regarding their political gifts to state and local officials and the relationship, if any, of those contributions to their underwriting business.
The SEC commissioner said the agency might publish a so-called 21 (a) report to spell out its findings.
An enforcement report issued under Section 21 (a) of the Exchange Act would strive to make clear what sort of muni-money conduct is unacceptable under federal securities laws.
In addition to this general inquiry, Mr. Roberts said the SEC's enforcement division continues to investigate particular cases of suspected political influence-peddling.
"Whether these inquiries result in enforcement proceedings remain to be seen," Mr. Roberts said in a speech prepared for delivery today at a securities-law conference in Louisville, Ken.
"It is clear, though, that a substantial amount of enforcement attention will be focused on the municipal-securities market by the commission in 1994," he said.
The SEC now has under review a proposed rule, fashioned by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, designed to quash the once-prevalent muni-market practice known as "pay to play," in which securities firms made political contributions to state and local officials to obtain underwriting business.
