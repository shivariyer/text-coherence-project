French luxury goods maker LVMH Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton ADR surprised analysts with better-than-expected 1993 earnings and a bold profit forecast for 1994.
Despite the unglamorous economic environment, last year's net profit fell only to 2.97 billion francs ($517.3 million), a drop of 1.2% from 1992.
Even the champagne division's operating profit was stable.
Strong sales growth at the end of the year boosted 1993 sales 10% to 23.82 billion francs.
The company, which makes leather goods and cosmetics as well as champagne, said growth will keep sparkling in 1994: By late February, sales already topped 1993 levels by 28%.
For the whole year, group Chairman Bernard Arnault predicted a 20% rise in net profit.
Following the earnings report, LVMH shares gained 5%, or 208 francs ($36), climbing to 4,389 on the Paris stock exchange yesterday.
