An Alabama municipal-bond dealer filed suit against the Securities and Exchange Commission challenging the constitutionality of a proposed rule that would put restrictions on political campaign contributions made by dealers.
William Blount, who is also chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, and his securities firm, Blount, Parrish & Roton Inc., filed suit against the SEC in federal court in Montgomery, Ala., seeking to block the rule from taking effect and to have it declared unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds.
The proposal would bar a dealer from doing business with a state or locality within two years of making a contribution to an official of the jurisdiction.
The rule, which would apply to contributions made on or after April 1, was proposed by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, a self-regulatory body that is overseen by the SEC.
The board is also named in the suit.
SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has said he believes the rule, which has also been assailed by state and local officials, will pass constitutional muster.
Neither the SEC nor the MSRB had any official comment on the lawsuit.
The rule was proposed in January in response to what officials called widespread linkage between political contributions by bond dealers to state and local officials and the obtaining of bond-underwriting business.
The lawsuit seeks a preliminary injunction to block the rule's enforcement, as well as a ruling that it is unconstitutional because it "substantially burdens and restricts plaintiffs' exercise of their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech."
