Wackenhut Corp.'s Wackenhut Corrections Corp. unit said it was chosen by the Florida Correctional Privatization Commission to design, build and manage a 750-inmate prison in Glades County.
Wackenhut Corrections expects annual revenue of $12 million from its three-year contract to run the prison.
The contract also gives Wackenhut two one-year options to continue operating the prison.
