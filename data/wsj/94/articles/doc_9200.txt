Conner Peripherals Inc. said its new software unit has agreed to acquire Quest Development Corp., a closely held software concern in San Luis Obispo, Calif.
Conner, a maker of computer disk drives, created the unit, called Arcada Software Inc., in November and transferred its software assets into the unit late last year.
Under the agreement, Quest shareholders will receive cash and Arcada shares in exchange for all Quest stock.
Conner, which is based in San Jose, Calif., wouldn't place a value on the acquisition.
Conner intends to use Arcada as an "acquisition vehicle" to gain muscle in the market for software that manages mass storage of computer data, said William J. Schroeder, Arcada's chief executive.
Conner, traditionally a hardware company, "spied what is an opening market opportunity in storage-management software," he said, adding that "this is the first clear step that shows we're serious about it."
