Sports Markets Inc., under pressure from the NCAA, pulled the plug on its stock-market-simulated basketball contest running on the Internet computer network.
The contest by the startup ran afoul of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's efforts to separate its annual basketball tournament from "any semblance of gambling," said Francis Canavan, NCAA spokesman.
"It's an unfair and illegal exploitation of our tournament," Mr. Canavan said of the First Annual College Basketball Stock Market Challenge.
"We have an interest in protecting our goodwill."
The contest, which was the subject of an article this week in this newspaper, allowed entrants to "trade" shares on their computers of the 64 teams playing in the NCAA tournament.
The grand prize was $25,000.
Although Sports Markets co-founders Boaz Weinstein, 20 years old, and Simon Reeves, 22, have conceded defeat, they maintain that their contest was completely legal, but that they couldn't afford to challenge the NCAA in court.
"This time the David and Goliath story didn't work out the same way," Mr. Weinstein said.
Anyone who entered the program for the $69.95 fee can expect a full refund.
