Bloomberg P.L.'s Bloomberg Financial Markets is expected to announce today that it will launch a business-television news network to be broadcast by General Motors Corp.'s unit, Hughes Electronics Corp.'s DirecTv satellite.
Michael Bloomberg said the program, to be produced in alliance with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, will offer 13 hours of business news, 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. EST, starting in May.
He said he expects the network, Bloomberg Direct, to offer 24-hour-a-day programing by year end.
DirecTv customers will use a satellite dish and a decoder box to receive the signals.
Last month, Dow Jones & Co., publisher of this newspaper, announced a similar direct-broadcasting service.
It purchased a minority stake in Hubbard Broadcasting Inc. and will provide broadcasting for Hubbard's new U.S. Satellite Broadcasting venture, a national direct-broadcast satellite service beginning operation in April.
BLOOMBERG L.P.'s name was misstated as Bloomberg P.L. in an article yesterday that described Bloomberg's plans to launch a business-news television network.
