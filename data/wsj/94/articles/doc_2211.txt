Metallgesellschaft AG said it has reached an agreement to sell its 47% stake in Kolbenschmidt to Dana Corp. of the U.S.
The Frankfurt company wouldn't release price or timing details, and said the sale is contingent upon approval of antitrust authorities and the companies' supervisory boards.
"The companies intend to close this transaction in short order," Metallgesellschaft said in a press release.
A spokesman for the company couldn't be reached.
Kolbenschmidt, a German auto-parts making subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft, forecasts sales of 1.1 billion marks ($653.2 million) in the year ending Sept. 30 1994 and employs 7,600 workers worldwide, Metallgesellschaft said.
Dana Corp., also a maker of automobile parts, has annual sales of 8.6 billion marks and 35,000 employees.
