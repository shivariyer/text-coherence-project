Existing-home sales rose 12.3% in January from a year earlier as buyers took advantage of record low mortgage rates late last year.
On an annualized, seasonally adjusted basis, January sales hit 4.2 million, according to the National Association of Realtors.
The pace was the second highest on record, following the surge in December.
January activity slid 3% from December's revised annual pace of 4.4 million.
All regions posted healthy gains, with California outpacing the nation with a 20.2% jump in activity from a year before even though prices continue to drop there.
The numbers reflect sales that on average take 30 to 90 days to close, and were therefore largely unaffected by winter storms in the Northeast and Midwest.
The bad weather, however, is expected to damp sales to be reported in subsequent months.
Moreover, some analysts worry that a further increase in interest rates could throttle a housing recovery.
"The sharp uptick in interest rates could strangle housing sales," said Warren Lasko, executive vice president at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"The backlog of demand has already been worked off substantially.
I'm really concerned."
Mortgage rates, while still historically very low, have been ascending, convincing people that now is the best time to buy a house.
Last week, rates hit 7.44% for a conventional 30-year mortgage, more than half a percentage point above their 25-year low in October, according to a survey by HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., mortgage-data publisher.
"We've all been a little Polyannish on interest rates," Mr. Lasko said.
"The market is just too nervous to let rates go down."
