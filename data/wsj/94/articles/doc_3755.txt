Canadian capital spending is expected to rise 4.2% this year from 1993, said Statistics Canada, a government agency.
Spending by Canadian businesses and government agencies on construction, machinery and equipment is expected to total 126.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$93.48 billion) in 1994.
The projected increase follows three consecutive annual declines in spending outlays.
Much of the 1994 rise is expected to come from manufacturing industries, which are expected to boost spending 10.4% from 1993 levels.
