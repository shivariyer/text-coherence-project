Shareholders of Society Corp. and Albany, N.Y.-based KeyCorp approved the previously announced merger between the two companies, ending some nervousness at the companies that the deal might not go through.
While the merger of equals was largely expected, during the past few weeks the companies lobbied resistant institutional investors who believed a better deal for KeyCorp might be found elsewhere.
Moreover, New York state law required a two-thirds approval from KeyCorp shareholders -- and those not voting would essentially become "no" votes.
But the wooing apparently worked, with 88% of KeyCorp's shareholders approving the plan.
Meanwhile, Society, which required a simple majority for approval, said 74% of its shareholders approved the deal, including 97% of those shares voting.
Under terms of the merger, KeyCorp shareholders will receive 1.205 shares of the new company common stock for each share of KeyCorp held.
Society shareholders will retain their existing number of shares in the new company.
The merger, effective March 1, will create a new banking company with about $60 billion in assets and more than 1,300 branch and affiliate offices in 18 states.
The combined companies will retain the name KeyCorp with headquarters in Cleveland.
