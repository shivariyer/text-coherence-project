Officials have persuaded American Airlines to continue jet service to the Panhandle City.
The cost to Amarillo taxpayers: as much as $1 million for this year.
While companies in many cities rally support for a particular airline, it is unusual for a government entity to directly subsidize a carrier.
In this case, American had planned to eliminate its three jet departures from Amarillo to Dallas-Fort Worth on June 16.
The move was part of the AMR Corp. unit's efforts to save costs by paring service from small cities.
But Amarillo's Economic Development Corp., funded by a local sales tax, offered American a minimum revenue guarantee on round-trip jet service flights.
(American also has four commuter flights a day from Amarillo.)
Under terms of the agreement, the Economic Development Corp. will cover any shortfall in revenue of as much as $1 million for the last six months of 1994.
In return, American will replace its 97-seat F100 jets with larger 142-seat MD-80s.
In addition, the Economic Development Corp., whose board is appointed by the city commission, will participate in deciding fares on American flights in and out of Amarillo and will also be involved in scheduling decisions, said John Ward, Amarillo's city manager.
The agreement, which is subject to approval, will be up for renewal every six months.
"We were more than happy to work with them," an American spokesman said.
