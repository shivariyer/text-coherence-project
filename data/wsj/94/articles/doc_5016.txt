The European Union Commission opened an inquiry into two capital injections valued at 940 million European Currency Units ($1.05 billion) from Italian state energy holding company Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi to its chemical unit, Enichem SpA.
In a statement, the commission said the capital was given to Enichem during 1992 and December 1993 by ENI and its investment unit SCI.
The commission said it hasn't received details of a restructuring plan for the company that is being prepared by the Italian authorities.
The EU's executive body must examine the plan to ensure that the subsidies will be used to return Enichem to viability and also to ensure that they won't damage competition in the EU.
The commission said that given the level of intra-Community trade in chemicals and the current recession, the capital injections "appear to distort trade and, therefore, to be . . . incompatible" with EU competition rules.
Separately, the commission said it also will probe a 670 million ECU subsidy paid by ENI to fertilizer company Enichem Agricoltura.
It said it needs more details of ENI's global restructuring plan before ruling whether the capital injections made between 1991 and 1993 are in line with EU subsidy rules.
However, it did say the capital injections appear to damage EU trade.
