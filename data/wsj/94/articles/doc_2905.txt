Alan Blinder, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, said that a "rumor" he will be nominated to succeed David Mullins as Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman was "well-founded."
"This is still in the rumor stage," Mr. Blinder said during a discussion with several financial reporters.
"Let me just say . . . it's a well-founded rumor.
And were this actually offered to me, I would look favorably upon it."
Mr. Blinder added, however, that "I have not been formally nominated for the job."
During the discussion, held to talk about the Group of Seven conference on employment in Detroit scheduled for next week, Mr. Blinder also restated the Clinton administration's view that "Germany and Japan could do more to expand their economies than they are now doing."
However, the official stressed that the next week's jobs conference is more focused on addressing structural impediments to job growth than to macroeconomic issues.
The Group of Seven also includes the U.S., Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
