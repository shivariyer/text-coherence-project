Staodyn Inc. said poor weather and the California earthquake, as well as computer glitches, would result in wider first-quarter losses than a net loss of $686,000, or 18 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.
The maker of electrotherapeutic medical devices said sales and earnings for the quarter ended Feb. 28 also "would be down substantially" from the fourth quarter of 1993, when the company posted losses of almost $82,000, or two cents a share, on revenue of $4.1 million.
Staodyn, Longmont, Colo., said winter weather and the earthquake affected patients' ability to visit rehabilitation and physical therapy clinics.
In addition, problems in converting to a new computer system at the company's TMD retail operations in Tampa, Fla., resulted in higher expenses and temporary revenue loss.
Staodyn said the computer system is now on-line.
In addition, the company said it extended the expiration date of its warrants outstanding to Feb. 28, 1995, from June 19, 1994.
Last year, the company extended the expiration date of the warrants from June 19, 1993.
