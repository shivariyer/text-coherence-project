United Parcel Service of America Inc. said thousands of drivers temporarily were off the job in January because of a business slowdown from bad weather and a recent strike.
On days when volume was off, the company said, some employees were told not to report to work.
In a recent letter reprimanding employees for last week's strike, the package carrier's chief executive, Kent C. Nelson, said domestic weekly ground volume fell as much as 13% in the first five weeks of 1994 compared with 1993.
Volume dropped 3.2% during the week of the strike, a decrease of about 350,000 packages.
Although the biggest declines were because of weather, Mr. Nelson said the strike cost the company "business, goodwill and jobs."
In the fourth quarter, the company's ground traffic, which makes up about 90% of its volume, fell about 1% on a decline in residential customers, a company spokesman said.
While not giving specific numbers, UPS said "several thousand drivers" had to stay home because of declines.
A week ago, UPS filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, seeking damages following what UPS called an illegal strike.
The Teamsters have said the suit is without merit.
