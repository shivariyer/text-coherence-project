National Westminster Bancorp said it will move 1,300 back-office jobs from the New York area to Scranton, Pa., to cut costs.
The bank-holding company also says it will farm out another 275 data-processing jobs to General Motors Corp.'s EDS.
National Westminster, a unit of Britain's National Westminster Bank PLC, said the moves will save $17 million annually after two years, and $25 million a year after 10 years.
The company said it will take a $25 million restructuring charge in the first quarter to pay for the moves.
Positions to be moved include 700 in Melville, N.Y., 295 in lower Manhattan and 195 in Bridgewater, N.J.
Current employees will be offered jobs in Scranton.
National Westminster, with assets of $24 billion, employs about 8,500 people in the New York area.
