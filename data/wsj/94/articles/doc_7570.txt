In your Jan. 4 editorial "Postal Bully," complaining about Postal Service enforcement of rules limiting private carriers, you claim that customers of Federal Express and other private services "must pay at least twice the cost of a first-class stamp and your shipment must be considered `urgent.' " Your claim is false -- surprisingly so, since this is the second occasion in recent weeks on which you have addressed this issue.
The law at which you take such umbrage (39 CFR sec. 320.6) says something altogether different.
Subsection (c) of that regulation states that if a customer pays double the postal rate (or $3, whichever is greater), his package will be "conclusively presumed" to be urgent.
In other words, there's no separate need to prove "urgency" in that case.
Of course, a customer may pay less than that, in which case urgency must be shown, as provided in subsection (b).
