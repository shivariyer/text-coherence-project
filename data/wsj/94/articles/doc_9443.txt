Reuters Holdings PLC said it plans to launch a financial television service for the foreign exchange market around the middle of the year.
Mark Wood, editor in chief of the London-based media company, told executives and analysts at a Palm Springs, Calif., media conference that the service would be available over the workstations of foreign exchange dealers, alongside existing data.
The company intends to begin the service with live video coverage of events of interest to the foreign exchange markets, such as news conferences.
Because it will be "event-driven," it will not begin as a continuous service, said a spokesman for New York-based Reuters America.
The service will be available initially in London and continental Europe.
Reuters said it expects eventually to offer it world-wide.
