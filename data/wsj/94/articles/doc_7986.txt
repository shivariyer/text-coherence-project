Amrep Corp. said investor Nick G. Karabots, a director of the company, had agreed to purchase about 1.2 million Amrep shares for $10 a share from shareholder Peter B. Bedford.
The purchase would boost Mr. Karabots's holdings to more than 24% of the shares outstanding from about 8%.
Mr. Karabots's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicated he views the purchase as an investment.
Mr. Karabots acquired his current stake in August in exchange for distribution rights to publications published or distributed by his companies.
Amrep is a New York housing developer and distributor of more than 800 magazines to local wholesalers across the country.
Amrep was quoted at $9.375, up 12.5 cents, in late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
