Cultivating a well-rounded image is fine.
But for sure impact, there's nothing like a rugged stereotype.
Texas tourism officials say a new advertising campaign -- especially the close-up shot of a weathered Western boot -- has spurred unexpectedly strong interest in the Texas Travel Guide.
The 272-page paperback, a compendium of the state's attractions, is distributed free to anyone requesting it by the Texas Department of Transportation.
Officials consider interest in the guide a leading indicator of the state's tourism industry, which had revenue of $21 billion last year; half of the people who request it generally visit the state within a year, they say.
In recent weeks, new travel-guide ads that have appeared in about 20 national magazines have produced a threefold surge in requests for the publication, says Stan Hodge, travel research coordinator for the Texas Department of Commerce.
The biggest response is coming from a two-page ad in February's Life magazine featuring a leather boot, a bluejean cuff and gleaming metal spur.
"How can you tell one country from another?
By their feet," the ad reads.
Mr. Hodge says the ad has generated 25,000 phone and mail responses.
GSD&M, the Austin agency that has produced ads for the travel guide since 1988, says the campaign's goal is to broaden outsiders' perceptions of Texas.
That's why some ads feature state beaches and bluebonnets.
But the boot "romanticizes Texas' Western heritage," says Steve Amos, an account supervisor with the agency.
The campaign, however, may have a costly consequence.
Producing and mailing the guide costs $1.50 a copy, and Mr. Hodge fears the strong response will put the state over its budget on the book this year.
"There may be such a thing," he says, "as being too successful."
