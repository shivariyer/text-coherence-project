The Congressional Budget Office endorsed an idea that's getting some attention on Capitol Hill: letting the government tap into the windfalls created when mutual savings banks become stockholder-owned institutions.
Acting on a request by Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), the House Banking Committee chairman, the CBO said the government has "a reasonable claim" to some of the gains, because federal deposit insurance helps thrifts accumulate their net worth.
The CBO said the government could be granted options to buy conversion stock or it could tax gains from conversions.
Mr. Gonzalez is interested in the concept of the government claiming some of the windfalls that go heavily to management when a depositor-owned savings bank converts to a stock savings bank, a committee staffer said.
But so far, the House and Senate Banking panels are concentrating on legislation that would help push federal financial regulators to adopt stiffer conversion rules that benefit depositors more as they limit insider windfalls.
Some witnesses in recent committee hearings have urged that part of the windfalls go either to the government or to local communities.
