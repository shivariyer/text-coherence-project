Net Ryland Group Inc. reported a 10% increase in fourth-quarter earnings largely due to improvements in its homebuilding operations.
The Columbia, Md., homebuilder and mortgage-services company posted fourth-quarter net income of $7.6 million, or 45 cents a share, up from $6.9 million or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue totaled $430.2 million, a rise of nearly 9% from the same period a year earlier.
Ryland's 1994 focus is on "optimizing the strength of our mortgage operations and maximizing shareholder value," said R. Chad Dreier, the company's recently named president and chief executive.
For the year, Ryland had a net loss of $2.7 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with net income of $27.5 million, or $1.66 a share, in 1992.
Revenue rose about 2% to $1.47 billion.
RYLAND GROUP Inc. said priorities in 1994 include improving its home-building operations.
An article Friday omitted this goal in citing the company's focus on "optimizing the strength of its mortgage operations and maximizing shareholder value."
