British Petroleum PLC said it and four Japanese companies signed an agreement with China National Petroleum Corp. to conduct geophysical surveys in the Tarim Basin.
The Tarim Basin lies in a remote northwestern part of China.
The area is said to hold as much as 70 billion barrels of oil; if that figure is correct, the basin would triple China's reserves.
BP said its BP Exploration Operating Co. unit and four other partners would now have three years to conduct seismic surveys in Block 4 of the basin, with an option to conduct exploration drilling subsequently.
The British company holds a 55% interest in the Tarim Group.
Nippon Oil Exploration Co. has a 15% interest.
Three other companies -- Itochu Oil Exploration Co., Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui & Co. -- each have a 10% stake.
