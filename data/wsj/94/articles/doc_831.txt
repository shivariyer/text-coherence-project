Spiegel Inc. said it will hire 500 to 600 people and take over a Wichita, Kan., telephone-order facility closed last year by Sears, Roebuck & Co.
Sears closed the 50,000 square foot facility last year in conjunction with the closing of its Big Book catalog operations.
Spiegel said the jobs created in its new catalog order center won't be offset by layoffs at its three other telephone order centers.
Sears had employed up to 1,600 people at the Wichita facility during peak holiday shopping.
The Downers Grove, Ill., catalog company has reported strong sales growth in recent months.
The transaction includes the assumption of the Sears lease at the facility and the purchase of the center's telecommunications equipment.
The center will provide order-taking services for the Spiegel catalog, and its Eddie Bauer and New Hampton catalog units, as well as for Catalog 1, its cable-television shopping service.
