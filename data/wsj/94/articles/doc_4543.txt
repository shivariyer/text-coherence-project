Concept Communications Inc. said it acquired a controlling interest in Nostalgia Network Inc. from Tiger Communications Inc. for $11.5 million, a price that values Nostalgia shares at $2.16 to $2.30 apiece.
The move gives Concept a significant advantage in the bidding to buy the cable network, which had been the subject of several offers in recent months.
In particular, it nudges aside International Family Entertainment Inc., Virginia Beach, Va., which had been discussing a $2-a-share offer for the company.
The purchase boosts Concept's stake to about 11.5 million shares, or 59% of the company, from 32%.
As part of the agreement, Concept is to invest $2 million in Nostalgia in newly issued shares at a price of at least $2.30 a share.
Nostalgia is a cable network that targets viewers over 45 years old.
A spokesman for Nostalgia wasn't available to comment.
