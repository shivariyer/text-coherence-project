U.S. Long Distance Corp., San Antonio, said it is likely to report a first-quarter loss, partly because of accounting and legal costs related to an informal Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company's accounting.
The long-distance and operator-services concern maintains that its financial statements are fairly stated.
The inquiry involves how U.S. Long Distance accounts for certain receivables that it acquires.
After the inquiry was disclosed last month, the company was sued by two shareholders alleging improper accounting.
U.S. Long Distance called the suits unfounded.
The company said its loss for its first quarter, ended Dec. 31, could reach five cents a share.
Analysts had expected a profit of five cents to 11 cents.
A year earlier, profit before a tax benefit totaled $548,000, or five cents a share.
U.S. Long Distance last month postponed a planned offering of 1.6 million shares until the SEC inquiry is completed.
The company said it is cooperating in the investigation.
