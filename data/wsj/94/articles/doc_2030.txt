Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc. is expected to name Hank J. Belsky executive vice president of the company and head of its Dejaiz and Chess King men's clothing store chains.
Mr. Belsky, who had been executive vice president of Americo Group Inc., a New York-based apparel manufacturer, is expected to join Merry-Go-Round on April 4, according to people close to the company.
Company executives couldn't be reached for comment.
Mr. Belsky will work primarily on "refocusing" the merchandising direction of the store chains, according to people close to Merry-Go-Round.
Merry-Go-Round operates more than 1,400 stores in 44 states that sell contemporary fashions to young men and women.
Dejaiz operates 366 stores, and Chess King operates about 400 stores.
The company has been searching for a chief merchant who would at some point succeed Leonard Weinglass, Merry-Go-Round's founder and chairman, who recently returned to take over the company's merchandising operations.
According to those familiar with the company's plans, Mr. Belsky is the most likely candidate to become the company-wide head of merchandising.
The company is expected to continue its search for top merchants for its remaining chains.
Merry-Go-Round, which filed for federal bankruptcy protection in January, has had disappointing sales from stores open at least a year.
It also has had trouble maintaining sufficient inventory levels at stores.
The company is working to improve relationships with vendors, but said it will take a few months for the inventory levels to rebound.
