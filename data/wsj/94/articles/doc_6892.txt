An avalanche of negative news stories caused shares in Fokker NV to slide 8.3% yesterday but the Dutch aerospace company dismissed the reports.
The shares closed at 21 guilders ($10.81) on the Amsterdam exchange, down from 22.90 guilders Tuesday, amid reports that the company faces massive losses this year and that a board room battle may claim additional victims.
Already this week, Chairman Erik Jan Nederkoorn announced his departure after an apparent disagreement with other directors over ongoing restructuring efforts.
Fokker, which is 51% controlled by the Deutsche Aerospace AG arm of German industrial group Daimler-Benz AG, was said to be facing losses this year of anywhere between 108 million and 276 million guilders.
However, the company issued a statement saying the internal report used by the media is outdated, although it didn't give any loss estimates.
