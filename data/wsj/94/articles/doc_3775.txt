Georgia-Pacific Corp. said James C. Van Meter, vice chairman and chief financial officer, is retiring.
Mr. Van Meter, 55 years old, had joined the forest-products concern in 1983 as CFO.
He will be succeeded in that position by John F. McGovern, 47, currently senior vice president, finance.
Mr. McGovern joined Georgia-Pacific 13 years ago as vice president, project financing.
At one time, Mr. Van Meter was considered a candidate to succeed T. Marshall Hahn Jr., former chief executive officer.
But in January 1993, the company named A.D. "Pete" Correll, president and chief operating officer, to that position.
At the time, Mr. Van Meter was elevated to vice chairman.
Mr. Van Meter's retirement as CFO and as a director is effective immediately.
He will retain the office of vice chairman until March 11 and will continue to work with the company as a consultant.
