American Airlines asked the Department of Transportation to refuse to renew the agreement between British Airways and USAir that allows those carriers to share flight codes in the computer-reservation system.
In March, the DOT authorized a one-year code-sharing agreement between British Air and USAir, a unit of USAir Group Inc.
That authorization ends March 17.
American, a unit of AMR Corp., fought the agreement last year.
By sharing flight codes, British Air and USAir appear as in the reservation system as one airline covering more countries with connecting flights.
The effect is that USAir can feed domestic passengers onto British Air flights abroad-taking customers away from American.
American says code sharing generally should be forbidden because it misrepresents which airline a passenger actually is flying.
American says it specifically objects to the alliance because it believes the British government doesn't allow the same access to British markets that the U.S. government gives to domestic markets.
