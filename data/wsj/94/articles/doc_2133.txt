CBS Inc. reinstated the CBS Television Network division it eliminated more than five years ago and named Peter A. Lund, executive vice president of the CBS Broadcast Group, as president.
CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer cited the network's recent Olympics ratings triumph, the success of David Letterman in late night and CBS's continued prime-time ratings leadership as reasons for reviving the network presidency.
"The value of a `network' has never been more obvious," Mr. Stringer said in a memo to his staff.
The post of network president was abolished along with the division in May 1988, at the close of the television season that saw CBS drop to third place from second.
CBS network operations were at the time divided up between marketing and affiliate-relations executives.
Mr. Lund, 53 years old, had been executive vice president of the CBS Broadcast Group and president of CBS Marketing since October 1990.
Before that, he was president of Multimedia Inc.'s Multimedia Entertainment.
Mr. Lund also worked at CBS from 1977 to 1987 at posts that included president of CBS Sports and president of the CBS television stations.
CBS's television-station and radio divisions will continue to report to Mr. Lund, as will the sales and marketing-and-communications departments.
Affiliate relations, which had reported to Mr. Stringer, will report to Mr. Lund.
Mr. Lund will continue to report to Mr. Stringer.
