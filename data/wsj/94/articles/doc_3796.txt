Reflecting the strength of the global music business last year, PolyGram NV said 1993 earnings climbed 21% on a revenue gain of 12%, led by the performance of such artists as Sting and Bryan Adams.
The London-based music and film company also announced a proposed 15% increase in the 1993 dividend from the 1992 payout of 33.5 cents a share.
The proposed increase, subject to shareholder approval, will be paid on May 24 to shareholders of record May 6.
The results surprised investors, who drove up the company's stock $2.125 to $40.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
A total of 132,000 shares traded hands yesterday, about three times normal daily volume.
The company earned $316 million on sales of $3.82 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, compared with earnings of $262 million on sales of $3.41 billion in 1992.
Per-share earnings rose 19% to $1.83 from $1.54 a year earlier.
PolyGram, which is 75%-owned by Dutch consumer electronics giant Philips Electronics NV, said North American operating profit doubled in 1993.
"If there are any surprises for analysts, it's the fact that all of our financial ratios are now pointed in the right direction," said Alain Levy, PolyGram's president and chief executive.
Mr. Levy noted that PolyGram's North American net income benefited from tax-loss carry-forwards accrued in the U.S. in earlier years.
The company's revenue gains were led by a 13% increase in pop music, including 30 record albums that sold more than one million copies each.
Top performers included "So Far So Good" by Bryan Adams, which sold nearly seven million copies world-wide in six weeks.
Pop music accounted for 69% of the company's revenue last year.
Classical music sales were flat in 1993, reflecting major price-cutting.
Nonetheless, PolyGram's three major labels -- Decca/London, Deutsche Grammophon, and Philips Classics -- contributed 12% of total revenue.
The company's fastest-growing division was filmed entertainment, where revenue jumped 23% in 1993.
The movie "Posse," a black western released by Gramercy Pictures, PolyGram's North American distribution joint venture with Universal Pictures, grossed over $18 million and shipped more than 200,000 videocassettes.
In September, PolyGram acquired the black music company Motown for $301 million and sold 10 million new shares at $34 each.
This raised PolyGram's total capitalization to 180 million shares.
