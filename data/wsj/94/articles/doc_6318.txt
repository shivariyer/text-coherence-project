A Pea in the Pod Inc., Dallas, said sales for its fourth quarter, ended Jan. 29, rose 35% to $11.3 million from $8.4 million a year earlier, though sales at stores open a year or more dropped 7.5%.
For the full fiscal year, sales grew 37% to $40.9 million from $29.8 million, with sales at stores open a year or more up 2%.
The specialty maternity-products and apparel retailer said the fiscal year and fourth quarter were respectively 53 weeks and 14 weeks, compared with 52 weeks and 13 weeks for the previous year.
The company said sales were hurt by the cannibalization from opening additional stores in existing markets, together with the impact of the Los Angeles earthquake and harsh winter weather in other parts of the country.
Mark F. Schreiber, chairman and chief executive, said the company expects to open six to eight stores in the first quarter of 1994.
