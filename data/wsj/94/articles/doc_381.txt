Reader's Digest Association Inc. launched a new children's book and entertainment division, to be called Reader's Digest Young Families Inc.
Co-chairmen of the new subsidiary are Joshua Gaspero and Mike Morris, both 51 years old, co-founders of children's book publisher Joshua Morris, which was acquired by Reader's Digest in 1991.
Books will continue to be published under the Joshua Morris name, as well as under existing names like Reader's Digest Kids, Wishing Well and Wilton House.
The operation will be based in Wilton, Conn.
Although the publishing company based in Pleasantville, N.Y., gets nearly half its annual revenue of $2.87 billion from books, it has been relatively small in the area of children's books.
A spokeswoman said the new subsidiary will publish about 40 titles in 1994, up from 37 children's titles published by the parent last year.
