Capital Cities/ABC Inc. reported a 21% jump in fourth-quarter net income, helped by a pickup in broadcast revenue from both television and radio.
Capital Cities said fourth-quarter net, which was slightly better than expected, climbed to $166.7 million, or $10.35 a share, from $137.9 million, or $8.38 a share, in the year-earlier period.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of Capital Cities rose $1, or 0.2%, to close at $664, after climbing $3.50 earlier in the day.
The stock is up more than 7% so far this year.
"There's good strong revenue growth," said Jay Nelson, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
"Better-than-expected top-line revenue growth is welcome."
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.76 billion, up nearly 7% from $1.64 billion.
Revenue from broadcasting jumped a healthy 9%, while revenue from publishing eased 2.9%.
ABC Television Network, in particular, reported big gains because of higher ratings and stronger advertising revenue.
ABC Radio Networks also performed strongly.
About 85% of the company's income is derived from broadcasting.
"They had an especially strong quarter in broadcasting," said Edward Hatch, an analyst at UBS Securities.
"They had better ratings and tight cost controls."
For the full year, the New York-based media giant reported net income of $455.3 million, or $27.79 a share, including a charge of $12.1 million, or 74 cents a share, for early debt redemptions.
Year-earlier earnings were $246.1 million, or $14.82 a share, including a noncash adjustment of $143 million, or $8.63 a share, to reflect a change in accounting for retiree benefits.
Average shares declined last year as a result of the purchase of 1.1 million shares in December.
The company said it expects to continue to repurchase its shares on the open market.
Revenue rose 6.2% to $5.67 billion from $5.34 billion.
While ratings have been on the upswing, looking ahead, "CBS will steal the show with the Olympics" in the first quarter, said Mr. Hatch.
