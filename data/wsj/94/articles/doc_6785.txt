As anticipated, Silicon Graphics Inc. named Edward R. McCracken to succeed James H. Clark, chairman and founder.
Mr. McCracken, 50 years old, has played the nuts-and-bolts man to Mr. Clark's role as visionary within the company.
It was Mr. Clark, for example, who was credited with forging Silicon Graphics recent multimedia joint ventures with Time Warner Inc. and Nintendo.
But analysts said they didn't expect the transition to cause any ripples in Silicon Graphics' strategy of moving into other digital media ventures.
"Silicon Graphics has a number of visionaries besides Jim Clark.
I wouldn't be surprised if they had other unannounced partnerships on the boards," said Laura Conigliaro, of Prudential Securities Research.
"Jim Clark's vision is alive and well in the company," said Robert Herwick, of Hambrecht & Quist.
Analysts cited as proof Silicon Graphics separate announcement yesterday that Forest Baskett, 50, the company's senior vice president of research and development, was being given the additional title of chief technology officer.
Dr. Baskett is known as one of the company's leading innovators.
Silicon Graphics said Mr. McCracken will retain his title as chief executive officer.
His job as president will shift to Thomas Jermoluk, 37.
Mr. Jermoluk, in turn, will remain chief operating officer but the company will retire his other title of executive vice president.
