Paris based catering group Abela Corp. lodged a formal complaint with the European Union Commission on Wednesday against Olympic Airways of Greece to block the airline's application for a $1.2 billion debt write-off.
Abela accused Olympic of violating several EU laws by breaking contracts that would have given Abela a majority stake in the Greek airline's catering unit.
The move follows an announcement in January by Abela of its plan to file a lawsuit in a Greek court seeking as much as $25 million in damages from Olympic, and a further action in Geneva claiming as much as $75 million.
Abela claims that the airline broke a 1991 agreement under which it bought 49% of Olympic Catering for $14 million.
Under that deal, Abela was eventually to take an additional 17% through an option.
But when Abela sought to excercise that option last September, after restoring the catering unit to profitability, Olympic refused the deal and soon after dismissed senior managers and board members installed by the Parisian company.
"What we are saying is that they have renationalized the company through the back door," alleged Alexis Sacre, formerly Abela's chief representative at Olympic Catering.
"We feel the company today is worth at least $75 million.
We'll be backing it up with accounts or whatever it takes."
On Tuesday, Greek newspapers printed a memo sent to Olympic employees in which the airline management said that its debts would soon reach about 530 billion drachmas ($2.13 billion), and that the airline would have to shut down if its request to write off about half that is blocked by the EU Commission.
A senior Olympic Catering official said the company did not break any agreement by dismissing managers and board members, and claimed that under Greek law Abela could not have boosted its holding above 49%.
