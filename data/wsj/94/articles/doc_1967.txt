Co-branding is becoming the latest breakfast cereal fad.
General Mills Inc. says it is teaming up with Hershey Foods Corp. to produce a ready-to-eat cereal called Reese's Peanut Butter Puffs.
The kids' cereal combines General Mills's Kix corn puff technology with the taste of Hershey's Reese's Peanut Butter Cups candy, which contain peanut butter and chocolate.
The nation's second-largest cereal maker, General Mills says this is the first time it's collaborated with another company in the U.S. to create a cereal.
Overseas, General Mills distributes cereals in a joint venture with Nestle S.A.
Only last week, Kellogg Co., the market leader, announced an agreement with ConAgra Inc., whereby Kellogg would make and market three Healthy Choice cereals, licensing the ConAgra foods brand.
Both efforts indicate the increasing cost of launching a cereal, and manufacturers' efforts to ensure the brand's success.
Typically, a new brand must win more than one-half of 1% of the $8 billion market to survive.
Co-branding, where two companies share brand equities in a single product, has been growing in popularity elsewhere in the supermarket.
In part, double-branded items are seen as a way to counter the rising popularity of private-label or house brands.
