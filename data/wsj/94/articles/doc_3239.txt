W.R. Grace & Co. said it plans to boost production capacity at its Grace Packaging unit through a $70 million expansion plan.
The specialty chemicals and healthcare concern said the expansion will allow it to increase manufacturing of its Cryovac shrink film product line.
Facilities in Grace Packaging plants in the U.K., South Carolina and France will receive additional equipment.
