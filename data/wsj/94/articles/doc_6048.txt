The Canadian House of Commons approved legislation ordering an immediate resumption of work at West Coast Canadian ports, which have been paralyzed by a 12-day-old labor dispute.
The work stoppage has halted shipments of grain, potash, lumber and other commodities through Vancouver and other ports.
Some cargo has been diverted to U.S. ports including Seattle.
The contract dispute involves the International Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union and the British Columbia Maritime Employers' Association.
The union has been without a contract since December 1992.
The legislation provides for arbitration of the dispute, which centers on the union's wage demands.
The union is seeking an increase of 2.20 Canadian dollars (US$1.64) over three years in the hourly base rate of longshoremen.
The rate is currently C$21.41 an hour.
