As a designer and distributor of Audit Master auditing software to numerous Fortune 500 corporations, we are in a position to know our customers' auditing habits and behaviors.
Your Dec. 13 marketplace article "Firms Reveal More Details of Environmental Efforts But Still Don't Tell All," unfairly suggests that most large corporations have something to hide about their environmental activities.
In defense of our customers, you should know that environmental audit reports may refer to proprietary manufacturing processes.
There are more than environmental issues at stake.
