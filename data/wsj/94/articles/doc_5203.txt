American Express Co., New York, plans to sell about $195 million of securities it owns in Travelers Inc.
The plans include the sale of 2.5 million shares of 5.5% convertible Travelers preferred stock; each of the series B shares has a stated value of $50 and is convertible at a price of $36.75 a common share.
American Express also plans to sell 3.75 million Travelers warrants, each of which represents a right to buy one share of Travelers common stock at $39 a share until July 31, 1998.
Travelers won't receive any proceeds from the offering.
American Express acquired the securities in July 1993 when it sold its Shearson brokerage unit to Primerica Corp., the predecessor to Travelers Inc.
American Express plans to sell the securities through a public offering for which Travelers has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Travelers closed at $39.125, down 37.5 cents.
