Cameco Corp. said the Canadian government approved its plans to develop three new orebodies at its Rabbit Lake uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan.
The Rabbit Lake mine is owned two-thirds by Cameco and one-third by Uranerz Exploration & Mining Ltd.
The companies still need licenses from the Atomic Energy Control Board.
