Advanced Logic Research Inc. returned to profitability in its fiscal first quarter after posting losses for several quarters amid a personal-computer price war.
The Irvine, Calif., company, which makes microcomputer systems, said it earned $521,000, or five cents a share, in the first period ended Dec. 31, compared with a net loss of $1.8 million, or 16 cents a share, a year ago.
Sales climbed 17% to $49.6 million from $42.5 million.
The year-earlier loss included an accounting-related net charge of $900,000, or eight cents a share.
The charge was taken after the company's initial earnings announcement for the quarter.
A company spokesman said the company ended its loss streak by focusing on higher-margin products and scaling back operations.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Advanced Logic Research shares closed at $4.625, up 50 cents.
