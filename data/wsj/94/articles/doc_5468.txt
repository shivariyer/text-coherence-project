Buoyed by the prospect of near-term growth, manufacturers and construction firms continue to be optimistic about new orders, employment and prices, according to two surveys by Dun & Bradstreet Corp.
The monthly survey of 1,000 manufacturers nationwide showed an increase in expectations about the coming three months, despite a sharp decline in production and new orders reported in the past three months, which were largely the result of harsh weather conditions.
Douglas P. Handler, manager of economic analysis for the business information services company, speculated that manufacturers could overproduce in the first part of the year and be forced to make cyclical cutbacks in production.
D&B's industrial-sentiment index was up for the second consecutive month, rising to 21 from 20.
The index represents the percentage of responding companies expecting increases in the coming three months in orders, production and other facets of manufacturing, minus the percentage expecting decreases.
D&B's survey of 200 construction firms indicated strong optimism for near-term increases in employment, new orders and prices in the industry.
The index measuring three-month expectations for orders shot up to 43 in January from 18 in December.
The index for employment rose to 33 from 15, and the index for prices rose to 23 from 19.
However, orders and employment in January fell sharply from December's levels.
With stable interest rates, "the rise in construction orders is now driven by improving economic conditions throughout the country, rather than by falling interest rates," Mr. Handler said.
