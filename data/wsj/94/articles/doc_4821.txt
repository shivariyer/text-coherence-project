America West Airlines, bowing to pressure from creditors and shareholders, withdrew its motion requesting that the U.S. bankruptcy court here prohibit the sale or transfer of its securities.
America West, which has been operating in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection for almost three years, filed the motion last week because the carrier said it wanted to protect the company's tax benefits.
Those benefits can be lost when an investor acquires and reorganizes a company in Chapter 11.
But the motion drew quick fire from America West's creditor and equity committees, which said the action would hurt the value of the airline's securities.
By withdrawing the motion, America West avoids a fight in what has already been a long, contentious process.
Separately, the bankruptcy court granted America West's request to extend until next Wednesday the date on which the company must choose a lead proposal from potential investors.
America West has been in discussions with several interested parties, including New York money manager Michael Steinhardt, but no clear leader has emerged.
