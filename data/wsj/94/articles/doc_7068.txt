Beneficial Corp. said fourth-quarter earnings almost doubled, aided by a sharp gain in receivables growth and improved credit quality.
The consumer finance, banking and insurance company, based in Wilmington, Del., said net income rose to $43.3 million, or 80 cents a share, from $22.7 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.
The 1992 figure includes a loss of $600,000, or one cent a share, from discontinued operations.
Per-share figures reflect a 2-for-1 stock split effective Dec. 15.
Finance receivables at year end totaled $11.02 billion, up 15% from $9.59 billion a year earlier, and the allowance for credit losses was 2.53%, down from 2.74% a year earlier.
The company said the year-end loss reserve "remains quite conservative both on an absolute basis and relative to net charge-offs."
