Moody's Investors Service Inc., citing what it called the "expectation of lower profit margins in the future" for Eli Lilly & Co., lowered its ratings on the pharmaceutical company's $900 million of long-term debt.
The rating concern had put the Indianapolis-based company's debt under review last June.
James M. Cornelius, Lilly's chief financial officer and vice president, finance, said through a spokesman that the move "will have no material adverse effect on the company's financial position."
Moody's lowered to double-A-1 from triple-A the notes, medium-term notes, Euronotes and industrial revenue bonds issued by parent Eli Lilly; similarly marked down were guaranteed Eurobonds issued by Eli Lilly Overseas Finance N.V. and guaranteed amortizing debentures issued by the Lilly Savings Plan Master Trust C. The company's Prime-1-rated commercial paper wasn't under review.
Moody's said it expects Lilly's profit margins to narrow, partly from the loss of patent protection on certain profitable drugs, such as its Ceclor antibiotic, as well as a "dearth of meaningful new products for the intermediate term."
In addition, Lilly's weaker fundamentals will be exacerbated, Moody's said, by the rising concentration of negotiating power among its major customers in health-care services.
Moody's said the broad-scale corporate restructuring undertaken by Lilly should make it a more efficient organization but will "unlikely be sufficient to prevent an erosion in operating profit margins in the next few years."
It pointed out that the company's balance sheet is expected to remain "very strong" and that Lilly's planned divestiture of its medical device and diagnostics business will "enable management to concentrate its attention to restoring the forward momentum of its mainstay pharmaceutical business" and that certain development-stage drugs hold the potential for becoming big sellers.
