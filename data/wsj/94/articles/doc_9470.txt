Ladd Furniture Inc., High Point, N.C., said it expects to report a "modest" loss for the fourth quarter, compared with the profit of five cents to six cents a share expected by analysts.
Ladd's chairman, Richard R. Allen, said sales in the final quarter dropped to $124 million, from $129 million in the year-earlier period, for which the company reported net income of $1.5 million, or six cents a share.
Ladd attributed the slump to fewer product lines, manufacturing inefficiencies and slow sales of its higher-priced Pennsylvania House line.
Mr. Allen said the slowdown is "temporary" and that strong housing growth and rebounding consumer confidence will bring the company back to profitability this year.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Ladd shares closed at $10.125, down $1.375 or 12%.
