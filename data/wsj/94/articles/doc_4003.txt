Gerald P. Maloney, 60 years old, vice president of this electric-utility holding company, was named a director, temporarily increasing board membership to 13.
A company spokeswoman said the board will return to 12 members after the annual meeting in late April, as W. Ann Reynolds won't seek re-election.
Mr. Maloney also is executive vice president and chief financial officer of the company's AEP Service Corp. unit.
