Seagate Technology Inc. said it was successful in litigation with the Internal Revenue Service, and as a result believes it won't have to pay most of the $112.3 million in taxes sought by the IRS.
The IRS claimed Seagate owed taxes on an additional $285 million of income for the fiscal years 1983 through 1987.
At issue was the allocation of income between Seagate and its Singapore manufacturing facility.
Seagate said that based on an opinion issued by the U.S. Tax Court on the matter, it believes the disputed income figure to be about $45 million instead of $285 million.
A Seagate spokesman said the company doesn't expect any negative impact on earnings related to the matter.
Seagate is a Scotts Valley, Calif., maker of computer data-storage products.
The company or the IRS may appeal the decision, Seagate said.
