Magma Copper Co. said it intends to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell from time to time up to $300 million in debt or equity securities.
The copper producer said the most likely use for the proceeds from any offering would be to refinance debt.
Magma also registered a previously announced plan by Warburg, Pincus Capital Co. to sell 3.3 million shares of common stock, including one million shares to be converted from warrants held by Warburg.
The sale will leave Warburg, an affiliate of investment firm E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co. with a 36% fully diluted stake in Magma.
