Hit by slumping demand, Kanebo Ltd. said it reduced its nylon plant's production to 60% of capacity and is giving 540 workers three extra days off a month.
Kanebo, a major Japanese cosmetics and textile manufacturer, began the measures last month, according to a company spokesman.
The plant is in Hofu, 489 miles southwest of Tokyo.
The measure is planned to last through March.
