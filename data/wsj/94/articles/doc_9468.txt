Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. said its net income for the fourth quarter was 15 cents a share.
That includes a loss of $9 million at its Rio Tinto Minera unit, a newly acquired subsidiary whose principal asset is a copper smelter in Spain.
A year earlier, the New Orleans affiliate of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. reported net income of $36.4 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $208.7 million.
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold also said that its proved and provable reserves at year-end 1993 increased significantly over a year earlier.
The company said copper reserves increased 28% to 26.8 billion payable pounds, gold rose 22% to 29.1 million payable ounces, and silver was up 72% to 76.7 million payable ounces.
These new reserves were added primarily at the Grasberg deposit in Irian Jaya, Indonesia.
