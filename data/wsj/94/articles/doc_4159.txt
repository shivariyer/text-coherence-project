Boosted by strong catalog sales, J.C. Penney Co. reported a 17% increase in profit for its fiscal fourth quarter, to $437 million, or $1.64 a share, from $375 million, or $1.42 in the year-ago period.
The results, which included a $2 million charge for debt redemption, exceeded analysts' expectations of about $1.60 a share.
Sales for the period ended Jan. 29 rose 3.9% to $6.32 billion.
Noting that Penney's catalog sales rose 23% for the quarter, Edward Weller, an analyst with Robertson Stephens, said that Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s withdrawal from the catalog business continues to be a "major stroke of good luck" for Penney, the nation's fifth-largest retailer.
By improving the quality of its brands while cutting prices, analysts said the results indicate that Penney has lured customers from other retailers.
"I think it shows that the company continues to gain market share in the mass middle markets of the country and that their merchandise connotates good price-to-value images in the consumers' minds," said Dennis Van Zelfden, an industry analyst with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes.
For the fiscal year, Penney posted a 21% increase in net income, to $940 million, or $3.53 a share, from $777 million, or $2.95 a share.
The current fiscal-year results included a $55 million extraordinary charge for debt reduction and a $51 million gain from the cumulative effect of an accounting change.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Penney closed at $53.50, down $1.875.
