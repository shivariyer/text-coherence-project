IN THE WORLD BUSINESS special report Sept. 24, a footnote in the ranking of the world's 100 largest public companies provided by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective incorrectly defined insurance companies' fiscal 1992 sales figures as being based on assets.
Those sales figures were actually based on net premiums written.
In addition, the sales figure for American International Group was incorrectly given as $9,139,000,000.
It should have been $13,992,000,000.
