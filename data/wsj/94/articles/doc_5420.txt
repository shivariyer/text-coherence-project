Chrysler Corp. announced a recall of 110,000 1994 Dodge Intrepids, Eagle Visions and Chrysler Concordes, New Yorkers and LHSs, because of an electrical problem.
Chrysler is recalling sedans built between late July and early December 1993.
A transmission wiring flaw could stop the vehicles from starting, cause lights to malfunction, or cause a sedan to operate only in second gear, a spokesman said.
The Highland Park, Mich., auto maker is repairing the problem by rerouting the wires and protecting them from a steering rod which, by rubbing against the wires, can short out the system.
