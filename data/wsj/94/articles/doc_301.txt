Eaton Corp., citing increased demand in its automotive and commercial markets, plans to break ground in April for a 44,000-square-foot fastener-manufacturing plant in Brunswick, Ohio.
The plant and equipment will cost about $4.8 million.
About 45 employees will be hired in the expansion program and an additional 58 administrative staff will be relocated to the new facility from the division's headquarters, now located in leased office space in Lakewood, Ohio.
