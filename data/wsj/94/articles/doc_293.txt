Amdahl Corp. became the latest computer maker to enter the market for massively parallel database machines, which will be built by nCube Corp. and use software from Oracle Corp. and Information Builders Inc.
The company said the alliance with the three companies will develop electronic repositories that can store and retrieve vast amounts of data.
Massively parallel computers get their power from using hundreds or thousands of processing units; nCube, based in Foster City, Calif., makes systems with up to 8,192 processors.
Amdahl, which is best-known for mainframe computers compatible with those of International Business Machines Corp., also said it will boost its mainframe line with the addition of machines that use 10 and 12 processors.
The 12-processor system, to be delivered in the fourth quarter at a list price of about $30 million, offers a 40% performance boost over its previous eight-processor system, the company said.
The company's moves were intended to upstage IBM systems that will be unveiled next week.
The announcements are expected to include an improved version of an existing massively parallel machine, as well as a 10-processor mainframe.
Amdahl, which hasn't had a profit since the fourth quarter of 1992, expects to return to profitability this year.
To do that, it is trying to use partnerships with other vendors to find new niches that are growing faster than the moribund mainframe market.
But the market for massively parallel systems may be crowded, analysts note.
Vendors that match such systems with database software now include American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem Computers Inc.
Amdahl didn't disclose the price or delivery date of its new parallel systems.
