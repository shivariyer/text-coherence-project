Proponents of school financing reform were upbeat yesterday in Michigan, where a statewide referendum proposal calling for a sales tax increase seemed headed for passage, based on early voting returns.
Michigan voters had to vote on the $10.2 billion tax package after Gov. John Engler passed legislation last July that wiped away future use of local property taxes for public school financing.
The move created a national stir and a $7 billion shortfall for Gov. Engler that he has since said could be addressed with an increase in the sales tax to 6% from 4%.
With 10% of the precincts reporting, 172,184 people, or 72%, had voted in favor of the proposal, and 67,849 people, or 28%, against it.
The measure also called for cutting the state's income tax to 4.4% from 4.6%.
"I think we are going to win," said Gov. Engler, who pitted the proposal against a mandatory alternative that would have raised the state's income tax to 6% from 4.6% and would have raised taxes on businesses.
"It gives us a tax profile now that allows us to be very competitive nationally," he said.
Critics, however, said the sales tax boost would probably still fall short of fully funding the state's public school system.
Indeed, opponents of the governor's initiative claimed his plan was underfunded by as much as $1.2 billion.
The state "will either have to raise other taxes or cut other services that citizens require," said Julius Maddox, president of the Michigan Education Association, the teachers group that was part of an opposition movement that included tobacco interests.
The governor's measure, known here as "Proposal A," would include an increase in cigarette taxes.
If the measure passes it would be the first sales tax increase approved by Michigan voters after five rejections dating back to 1978.
Seven other plans addressing school financing and property taxes have also failed in the state since 1972.
