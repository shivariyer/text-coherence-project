The Northrop Corp. team building a next-generation stealthy cruise missile stands to lose at least $1 billion on the program by 1997, according to Air Force officials.
The officials, who oversee development of the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile, are quoted in today's edition of the defense newsletter Defense Week.
Northrop, based in Los Angeles, has reported $603 million in losses on the fixed-price program so far.
The company is expected to lose as much as $750 million, Brig. Gen. Richard Roellig said in the interview and in written follow-up responses.
The rest of the projected $1 billion losses are being incurred by about 25 subcontractors.
A Northrop spokesman said he is familiar only with the company's losses declared to date.
He also confirmed the company has increased oversight of the program.
The Army has been granted permission to leave the program, meaning the number of missiles to be bought has dropped to 4,525 from 6,650, the Air Force officials said.
The Air Force estimates the total cost of each Air Force missile at $2.1 million, with a Navy variant estimated to cost $5.2 million each.
Until now, the program has been highly classified, meaning few details have been available on costs and planned deliveries.
