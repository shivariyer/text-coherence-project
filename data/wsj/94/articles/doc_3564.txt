Barron's, the business and financial weekly published by Dow Jones & Co., will begin appearing in a redesigned format with the March 7 issue of the magazine.
The changes don't alter the content of Barron's.
"The substance of what we do remains the same," said James P. Meagher, editor of Barron's, "but redesigned for a cleaner, crisper look."
Mr. Meagher said most of the changes "came from suggestions we've received from readers over the years."
A highlight of the redesign is a new pullout section, "Market Week."
The pullout section combines Barron's display of market statistics and its markets columns, including commentaries on foreign and domestic stock markets, credit markets, options and commodities.
Other regular features and articles will be divided between the front and back portions of the magazine.
The first change readers will notice is the redesigned cover, which includes moving the start of Alan Abelson's "Up and Down Wall Street" column to an inside page near the front of the magazine.
In addition, pages will be four columns wide instead of the previous five columns.
"And we are eliminating the jumping of stories from one page to another far away," Mr. Meagher said.
"That improved continuity should help readers who like stories to be in one place."
Among the editorial features that will either be introduced or reformatted for the new design: expanded Washington coverage; a follow-up section on articles that appeared in earlier editions; book reviews, which Mr. Meagher said have been "on vacation" from Barron's recently; and an expanded section reviewing key events of the past week and highlighting those expected in the coming week.
The redesign was done by WBMG Inc., New York.
In addition to Barron's, Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, other business publications, electronic newswires, Dow Jones Telerate financial information and the Ottaway group of community newspapers.
