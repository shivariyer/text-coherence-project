TIG Holdings Inc. said directors authorized the repurchase of as many as 1.3 million shares, which will take place earlier than the company had planned.
TIG, a holding company for a property-and-casualty insurance group, said the buybacks may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, and will be financed by available company funds.
TIG currently has 63.9 million shares outstanding.
