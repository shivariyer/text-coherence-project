Stone & Webster Inc., expecting financial results to be "negatively" influenced in the first part of the year, said it would cut costs and trim its principal subsidiary's work force 6%.
The move follows remarks made in the company's latest annual report which says results would be hurt by lower profit margins and delays in the start-up of some new work among other factors.
The Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. unit will cut 300 of about 5,000 jobs nationwide and continue to consolidate certain offices and divisions.
Stone & Webster revenue suffered in the latest reporting period, falling nearly 13% to $63.3 million in the fourth quarter 1993.
Stone & Webster is an engineering and construction company.
