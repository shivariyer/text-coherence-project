Sports-apparel maker Starter Corp., which enjoyed a price runup a year ago when it went public, reported sharply lower earnings for the fourth quarter and projected continued weak results for the first half of 1994.
Starter said fourth-quarter net income fell 53% to $1.8 million, or seven cents a share, from the year-earlier pro forma $3.8 million, or 14 cents a share, although sales rose 7.4% to $77.6 million from $72.2 million a year earlier.
A spokesman said profit margins in the quarter were hurt due to increased distribution costs and "the inability of Korean outerwear manufacturers to obtain export quotas within reasonable time frames and at reasonable prices."
Starter had reported earnings gains as recently as the third quarter, when net income rose to $15.6 million, or 59 cents a share, from pro forma $12.6 million, or 47 cents a share, and sales rose to $148.7 million from $107.2 million.
Starter said its performance through the first six months of this year "will not be as strong" as a year ago.
The company previously had said first-quarter results would trail year-earlier figures, due to higher costs and sale of late-arriving inventory at lower than normal margins.
After the forecast, a shareholder sued the company alleging it had failed to disclose problems with winter outerwear products, and a spokesman yesterday said it expects a second suit.
Starter's shares, which went public at $21.50 in April 1993 and traded as high as $28 on the first day, have slumped and closed yesterday at $13.625 a share, up 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
For the fiscal year, net income on a pro forma basis rose 11% to $26.4 million, or 99 cents a share, from $23.8 million, or 90 cents a share a year earlier.
Sales rose 26% to $356 million from $282.7 million a year earlier.
