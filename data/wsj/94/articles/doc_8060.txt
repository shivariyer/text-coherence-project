Short interest in Nasdaq stocks, scheduled to have been reported at the close of trading yesterday, will be released at the close of trading Friday because of weather-related delays, according to the National Association of Securities Dealers.
The short-interest table for Nasdaq issues will appear in Monday's edition of The Wall Street Journal.
Short sales are bets that a stock's price will fall.
"The reporting of short-interest data has been delayed until the market-close Friday because last week's adverse weather conditions meant that NASD staff in Rockville, Md., couldn't get in to enter the figures," said an NASD spokesman.
"A number of Nasdaq-listed firms may also have been late in reporting short-interest data.
So we decided to give these companies a little extra time" to provide NASD with their respective short-interest entries, he said.
