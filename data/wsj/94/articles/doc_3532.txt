CML Group Inc., Acton, Mass., said net income for the fiscal second quarter climbed 18% to $38.3 million, or 74 cents a share, reflecting continued strong sales of its NordicTrack home-exercise machine.
In the year-earlier quarter, CML earned $32.5 million, or 63 cents a share.
Sales rose 25% to $292 million from $236.4 million.
The latest quarter ended Jan. 29.
The company said sales in its other two divisions, retailers Nature Co. and Britches of Georgetowne, rose significantly.
Sales at NordicTrack, the company's cash cow, increased 25%.
CML said profit margins in the second quarter were squeezed by increased advertising for some of NordicTrack's product lines.
But media expenditures have been cut substantially, which is expected to improve earnings in the coming quarters by equal measure.
Chairman Charles M. Leighton reaffirmed the company's goal of increasing earnings in the second half by 20%.
