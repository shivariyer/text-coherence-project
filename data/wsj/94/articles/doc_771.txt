Japan's major auto maker group said it will seek more cooperation with foreign auto and auto parts makers in an effort to ease trade frictions with the U.S. and other countries.
The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said it will call on its U.S. counterpart to reopen meetings between the two groups.
The last meeting between JAMA and the American Auto Manufacturers Association was in 1992.
JAMA Chairman Yutaka Kume, who is also chairman of Nissan Motor Co., said last week JAMA will announce its own plans to help reduce the industry's trade surplus with its trading partners.
He said the plan would be announced before individual auto companies start releasing their foreign auto parts purchase plans, which are expected by the end of March.
In addition to the talks with its U.S. counterpart, JAMA also proposed holding regular meetings between Japanese and European auto executives.
The auto and auto parts sector is a major stumbling block in framework negotiations between the U.S. and Japan, which have been suspended since last month due to discord over setting of numerical targets to measure the improvement in the bilateral trade imbalance.
The Japanese government is scheduled to release a package of voluntary market-opening measures next Tuesday, hoping it will pave the way for the resumption of the stalled trade talks.
As part of its voluntary measures, JAMA also plans to broaden the participation of new auto parts suppliers in business meetings where JAMA members and U.S. parts makers work together to expand business.
The industry group will also seek to increase the number of seminars and other events with auto makers from Europe, Canada, Australia and Asia.
