Stock prices crumbled under the weight of sharply rising interest rates and the unraveling of Bell Atlantic's planned takeover of Tele-Communications.
After recovering partially during the early afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank again, ending 51.78 points lower at 3839.90.
It was the Dow's lowest close since Jan. 7 and the index's biggest one day drop since Feb. 4, when the Federal Reserve's move to tighten monetary policy drove the Dow down more than 96 points.
Other stock-market indexes also posted steep declines.
Standard & Poor's 500 stock index tumbled 6.43 points to 464.26 and the Nasdaq Composite index slid 9.67 to 779.44 as investors rapidly unloaded telecommunications stocks after Bell Atlantic's pact to acquire cable-television giant Tele-Communications collapsed late Wednesday amid a bitter disagreement over price.
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index was off 6.16 to 465.58.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was extremely heavy with 341,615,000 shares changing hands, up from 309,891,000 shares Wednesday.
Declining issues smartly outpaced advancers, 1,795 to 442.
The relentless selling activated the New York Stock Exchange's 50-point "collar" rule that effectively stifles program trading any time the Dow industrials rise or fall 50 points.
Though the collapse of the Bell Atlantic-Tele-Communications deal cast a pall over the market when it opened yesterday morning, the real catalyst for yesterday's sharp drop was rising interest rates.
"The bond market just rolled off the edge at about 2 p.m. on the cumulative comments by Alan Greenspan and others about the strength of the economy," said William Dodge, chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter Reynolds.
Mr. Dodge said that even though the Federal Reserve didn't tighten monetary policy yesterday, traders were betting that, based on Mr. Greenspan's comments, the Fed will raise short-term interest rates sooner, rather than later.
That set off alarm bells in the bond market where the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond shot up to 6.73% from 6.65% the previous day.
The price dropped more than a point.
The rising rates clobbered utility stocks, with the Dow Jones Utility Average slumping 3.30 to 207.29, its lowest level since April 1992.

J.P. Morgan lost 1 to 67 5/8, Bankers Trust 7/8 to 80 1/2, Citicorp 5/8 to 40 3/8 and BankAmerica 1/2 to 42 1/2.
