Pace American Group Inc. said its board has begun an investigation into charges that certain former and present members of senior management have "engaged in improper transactions involving business of the company."
The surety-bond company said in Tucson, Ariz., that two top officers have taken voluntary leaves of absence "to facilitate the investigation."
They are Don H. Pace, president and chief executive officer, and Greg S. Kaplan, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Frank J. Barrett, a director, was named interim president and chief executive during the investigation.
Steven L. Ramsey, a certified public accountant, was named interim senior vice president and chief financial officer.
The company said it has reached no conclusions as to the truth of the allegations.
It declined to comment further.
