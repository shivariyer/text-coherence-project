First Pacific Networks Inc., San Jose, Calif., said it signed a nonbinding letter of intent with Central & South West Corp. of Dallas to provide energy management services to 2,500 Laredo, Texas, residents.
Under proposed terms, Central & South West's utility unit, Central Power & Light Co., would use a combination of fiber and coaxial cable to send residents information about power rates at different times of the day.
Residents would program in which rates they want to use, similar to the way people place phone calls during off-peak times to get lower rates.
Residents would also get itemized bills, showing how much energy was used by their larger appliances, such as refrigerators.
The pilot project is scheduled to last 18 months.
First Pacific develops and markets products for telephone, data and energy management communications.
