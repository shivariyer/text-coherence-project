Lubrizol Corp. said a federal judge in Houston ordered it to pay $129 million for infringing an Exxon Corp. patent.
In a 1992 trial, a jury ruled that Lubrizol had willfully infringed on Exxon's patent covering the use of copper in a motor-oil additive product.
A second jury late last year awarded damages of $48 million.
But the judgment U.S. District Court Judge Norman Black entered last week is substantially higher; because of the jury's finding that the violation was willful, he could have tripled the damages.
He doubled them, to $96 million, and the final amount includes prejudgment interest, court costs and Exxon's $23.8 million in attorney fees, Lubrizol noted.
Lubrizol noted it has already appealed the jury's earlier finding that the Exxon patent is valid and that there was infringement.
It said the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington's decision on the pending appeal "could affect" the judgment.
Lubrizol removed the copper from its products following the 1992 jury finding.
The company said it hasn't established a reserve to cover costs of the penalty, because it anticipates prevailing in the appeal.
Lubrizol said it "continues to believe that none of its products infringed the Exxon patent and that the patent is invalid."
