With all due respect to your Scots-born correspondent Paul Gilmour ("The Irish Are Scottish and Vice Versa," Letters, Jan. 3), Scotland is a true melting pot containing much more than the Irish-origin Scots.
There were also Caledonians (Picts, who may have derived from an earlier Celtic migration from the Continent), Angles (the northern border of English Northumbria once was the Firth of Forth, and Edinburgh was named after King Edwin of Northumbria), Danish and Norse Vikings (including my own Tait ancestor from Aberdeen-shire), the Welshspeakers of the ancient kingdoms of Strathclyde, Rheged and Manau Goddodin that lie in the southern tier of modern Scotland (the great fighting patriot Sir William Wallace apparently was descended from these "North Welsh"), and Normans (King Robert Bruce's ancestral surname is the Norman "de Brus" -- and just to complicate matters further, the Normans themselves were of Viking origin).
Thus the transplanted Protestant Scots of Northern Ireland, to the extent that they came from outside of the Gaelic-speaking Scottish islands and Highlands, are ethnically more heterogeneous and thus distinct from the Irish, certainly much more ethnically distinct than, say, Bosnians and Serbs.
(Two further observations are in order here: First, the modern Irish have their own English, Norman and Norse strains -- among other things, Norse Vikings founded Dublin.
Second, the actual genetic differences between the great Germanic and Celtic branches of the Indo-European family may be quite small.)
