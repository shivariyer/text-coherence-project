Central Illinois Public Service Co. said the 1,000 employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 702 ratified a new labor contract.
The contract replaces a pact that expired June 30, 1992.
At one point during the negotiations the utility locked out union members and continued to operate with its salaried staff.
The move triggered a complaint by the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to hold hearings on the matter this year.
The new contract expires June 30, 1995.
