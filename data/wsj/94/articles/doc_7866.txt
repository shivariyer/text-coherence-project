Future Healthcare Inc. said it completed the public offering of 1,359,500 common shares at $12.25 each.
The provider of clinical trial services to the pharmaceutical industry said it offered 800,000 of the shares, with the remaining 559,500 being offered by shareholder Christopher L. White.
Underwriters led by Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., New York, exercised an option to purchase an additional 80,000 shares to cover over-allotments.
Future Healthcare said net proceeds of the offering, which are expected to be $10 million, will be used to repay about $1.1 million principal amount of debt and to enhance computer, telecommunications and related capital equipment, with the balance to be used as working capital.
The company said that after completion of the offering, it will have 7,655,525 common shares outstanding.
GLASER CAPITAL Corp., Cincinnati, was the lead underwriter for the recently completed common stock offering of Future Healthcare Inc., also based in Cincinnati.
An article Wednesday incorrectly identified the lead underwriter as Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., New York.
