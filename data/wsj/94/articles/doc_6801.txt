Warner Insurance Services Inc. said it expects to service as much as $15 million of additional premiums this year.
The increase is due to the addition of Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. of Boston to the group of insurance companies whose New Jersey automobile assigned-risk insurance obligations are handled by Warner as the servicing carrier and Clarendon National Insurance Co. of New York as the insurer.
In 1993, Warner serviced about $140 million in total premiums, a spokeswoman said.
