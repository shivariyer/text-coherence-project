Intel Corp. said it settled several issues in a complex and long-running patent-infringement dispute with Cyrix Corp.
Under the settlement, Intel and Cyrix, of Richardson, Texas, agreed to drop patent-infingement counterclaims involving a system of external memory and paging software known as the '338 patent.
They also agreed on which thirdparty companies will be allowed to build Cyrix's microprocessor, which is part of the '338 system.
The companies said they will ask the International Trade Commission to drop '338-related claims against a third company that used Cyrix chips.
But Intel said it plans to proceed on a separate claim in the case involving the Cyrix customer's use of chips made by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
The two companies' dispute over the '338 patent has been in U.S. court since 1992.
They went to trial over the patent last month in federal court in Sherman, Texas.
"This settlement ends the trial," an Intel spokesman said.
But Intel said the settlement still leaves some '338 patent issues unresolved.
It is appealing a decision in the Sherman federal court last month that Intel may not collect royalties from Cyrix customers who bought clones of Intel's 386 and 486 chips made by Cyrix's primary subcontractor.
Cyrix is also seeking the court's permission for two other third-party factories to build cloned chips.
