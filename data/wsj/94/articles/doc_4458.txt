International Business Machines Corp.'s IBM Personal Computer Co. said it cut the prices of its ThinkPad 500 subnotebook computer by as much as 20%.
Under the new pricing, the 3.4 pound portable sells for $1,699 with an 85-megabyte hard drive.
The same computer with a 170-megabyte hard drive sells for $1,999.
IBM temporarily withdrew the model from the market last year while it fixed a battery problem.
IBM said the pricing move came in response to competition.
