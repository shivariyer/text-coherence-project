Liberty Technologies Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Industrial NDT Co., a closely held provider of safety compliance services for the paper, chemical and electric utility industries.
Liberty, which makes diagnostic systems for valves, motors and turbines, said it plans to acquire Industrial NDT for about $5.5 million, including $2.5 million in cash and the balance in Liberty stock.
The proposed acquisition would significantly boost Liberty's size.
Industrial NDT had revenue of $11 million in 1993, while Liberty's revenue totaled $18.6 million.
The transaction is expected to close by the end of March.
