Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., a unit of Transco Energy Co., said it completed repairs to its natural-gas transmission main line in Rockville, Md., after a third-party contractor punctured the line while working with a backhoe Tuesday.
Repairs were completed by Wednesday evening, and the 30-inch line was back in service yesterday morning.
The backhoe hit one of four parallel natural-gas lines, located near Route 28 and Research Boulevard, that are part of the company's main pipeline system.
No one was injured.
The natural gas was rerouted to adjacent lines, and deliveries weren't affected.
