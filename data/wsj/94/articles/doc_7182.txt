United Technologies Corp. said George David, president and chief operating officer, was named to the additional post of chief executive officer.
Chairman Robert F. Daniell, 60 years old, called the move a "logical next step in a carefully planned transition plan to assure continuity and stability in our top management succession."
The promotion of Mr. David, 51, who has been shepherding a major restructuring of the company, didn't surprise Wall Street analysts.
Since being named president and chief operating officer two years ago, Mr. David has played a visible role at the company in managing the restructuring.
Announced in August 1991, the restructuring is intended to slash $1 billion in annual costs by 1995.
In announcing the move, Mr. Daniell said Mr. David had done "an outstanding job in moving our restructuring program forward ahead of schedule."
Some analysts who gave Mr. David high marks for helping bring the company's stock "back on the growth path" said they were a little surprised by the timing of the announcement.
"It is bit sooner than I expected," said Phil Friedman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
"It means that Mr. Daniell is going to focus on strategic issues, and Mr. David is going to focus on operations," he said.
A United Technologies spokesman said Mr. Daniell has "no retirement plans."
Mr. David will assume the new position on April 18.
Mr. David joined United Technologies' Otis elevator unit in 1975.
United Technologies' other businesses include automotive products, jet engines and heating and air-conditioning systems.
