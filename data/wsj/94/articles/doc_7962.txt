Rust-Oleum Corp., a closely held maker of protective coatings, said the family that owns 90% of the company hired Lehman Brothers to find a buyer.
Rust-Oleum, of Vernon Hills, Ill., had revenue of about $132 million in the year ended Oct. 31, 1993, and its operating profit has risen in each of the past five years, the company said.
It wouldn't disclose earnings or an asking price for the company.
Donald C. Fergusson, chairman and president and a member of the controlling family, said that aligning Rust-Oleum with a larger company could help bring the resources needed for further growth.
The company was founded in 1921 and sells its paint products through 35,000 retail outlets.
The company employs 465 people and has manufacturing plants in Wisconsin, Maryland and Oklahoma.
