Cincinnati Milacron Inc. reported a fourth-quarter loss as a result of a one-time charge for closing two U.S. machine tool plants and consolidating machine tool operations.
The company's loss was $47.3 million, or $1.40 a share, due to the one-time charge of $47.1 million.
The quarterly loss also included losses of $4.7 millon on the sale of the company's Sano business.
Net profit a year-ago was $9.4 million, or 34 cents a share, which included an extraordinary tax credit of $2.5 million, or nine cents a share.
As part of its consolidation, the company will phase out two machine tool facilities in Fountain Inn, S.C., and Greenwood, S.C., and transfer the bulk of those operations to Cincinnati.
The consolidation will reduce the machine tool group's work force by 235 people, or 12%.
Cincinnati Milacron expects annual cost savings of about $16 million from the moves.
Sales for the quarter rose 25% to $272.7 million from $218.1 million, mainly reflecting contributions from the Valenite and Ferrmatik units, acquired in 1993.
Cincinnati Milacron makes machine tools, plastics machinery, computer controls, measurement and inspection equipment, grinding wheels and metalworking fluids.
For the year, sales were $1.03 billion, up from $789 million, reflecting "record shipments of plastics machinery and grinding wheels, as well as sales" of the newly acquired units, the company said.
"Our industrial products group is performing quite well, but we are disappointed with the operating results in our capital goods businesses, both machine tools and plastics machinery," the company said.
It hopes the consolidation will correct excess capacity problems in its machine tools business.
