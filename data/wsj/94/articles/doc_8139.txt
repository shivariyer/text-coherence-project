Steinhardt Management Co. moved a step closer to gaining control of Integrated Resources Inc., by reaching an agreement with senior creditors of the former tax-shelter company.
Integrated Resources, once one of the largest syndicators of limited partnerships in the 1980s, has been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code for four years.
Privately held Steinhardt Management is an affiliate of a New York-based hedge fund run by Michael Steinhardt.
It has been after Integrated Resources for two years, in alliance with subordinated creditors and lawyers representing individuals in the limited partnerships.
Under the Steinhardt plan, senior creditors with claims of $1.2 billion will receive 55 cents on the dollar in cash and stock of the new company, although Steinhardt says the distribution could be valued at as much as 96 cents on the dollar if the cash is reinvested in more stock.
Subordinated bondholders, who are owed $668 million, will receive a cash distribution of three cents on the dollar of claims, with the right to buy new Integrated stock.
Steinhardt Management will control 12% of the company's new stock.
Representatives of the creditors' committees voiced their support in a conference call last Thursday with federal bankruptcy Judge Cornelius Blackshear in the Southern District of New York.
Representatives of Integrated Resources, which has a competing plan before creditors, could not be reached despite repeated calls.
