Abitibi-Price Inc. said it agreed in principle to sell its Pine Falls, Manitoba, newsprint operation to a group that includes management and employees.
The Pine Falls mill has an annual capacity of 178,000 metric tons of newsprint, or less than 1% of the Toronto newsprint company's total capacity.
Under the proposed agreement, the company will be reimbursed for working capital related to the mill and receive preferred shares with a face value of 40 million Canadian dollars (US$29.5 million) for fixed assets.
The pact is subject to the completion of definitive agreements, financing and regulatory approvals.
A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds.
