Lloyds Bank PLC reported that pretax earnings for 1993 rose 29% as the bank further reduced provisions for bad and doubtful debt, contained costs and benefited from an improving economy in the United Kingdom.
Pretax profit rose to #1.03 billion ($1.51 billion).
The dividend was increased 20% to #22.1 pence a share from #18.4 pence.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations.
During 1993, Lloyds lowered its provision for bad and doubtful debt by 9% to #503 million for 1993.
It also cut its work force by 2,000 last year, bringing the total reduction over the past four years to more than 18,000.
Chairman Sir Robin Ibbs said the bank remains "watchful" for ways to make use of its capital growth, including possible acquisitions.
