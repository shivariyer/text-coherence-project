Imagine the surprise (not to mention, the horror) I felt when I read the Feb. 11 article indicating America's 60,000 surgeons support the single-payer (Canadian) type of health-care system.
It is not the preference of the members of the American College of Surgeons that was announced, but the report of the college's board of regents and/or governors, neither of which are responsible to the membership of the college.
They are not elected by the membership, are not accountable to the membership, and do not speak for or at the direction of the membership of the college.
Let me assure you that if this issue were put to a vote of the fellows of the college, the proponents of the single-payer system would closely resemble General Custer after the Battle of Little Big Horn.
American surgeons are very much aware of the failure of the Canadian system now teetering on the brink of bankruptcy -- so close that Canadian doctors are being required to accept one-week nonpaid layoffs, making already hard-to-get medical care more inaccessible.
In Canada, all of the predictable consequences of bureaucratic control over humanitarian professionalism are coming to fruition.
U.S. surgeons are acutely aware of this and want no part of it, the most blatantly socialistic of all plans.
I would hope the "leadership" of the American College of Surgeons would soon reverse this ridiculous and poorly thought-out position and get in step with the surgeons they purport to represent.
