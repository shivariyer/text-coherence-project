ITT Corp., New York, said its hotel unit agreed to purchase the Phoenician Golf & Tennis Resort in Scottsdale, Ariz., and the Crescent Hotel in Phoenix.
Although terms weren't disclosed, industry officials said ITT Sheraton Corp. purchased the luxury hotels for about $250 million from the Kuwaiti Investment Office, an arm of the Kuwaiti government.
The purchase includes 63 acres of land, 16 of which could immediately be developed.
Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, Irvine, Calif., controlled by Charles Keating's American Continental Corp., built the Phoenician hotel, which included nine Steinway grand pianos, in the mid-1980s for about $275 million.
In turn, the S&L sold a 45% interest in the hotel to the investment arm of the Kuwaiti government for $170 million.
In 1991, the Kuwaiti government purchased the remaining stake in the Phoenician, along with the Crescent, for $111.5 million from the Resolution Trust Corp.
At the time, government officials said they had a loss of about $67.5 million on the transaction.
