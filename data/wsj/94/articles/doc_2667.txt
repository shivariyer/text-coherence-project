Dial Page Inc. said it agreed to buy some 500 specialized-mobile-radio channels in Texas, a move that extends the communications concern's SMR network to a 13th state.
Under the agreement, Dial Page will purchase the channels, as well as other related assets, with 1.5 million shares of stock in a new Dial Page holding company that's expected to be formed later this year.
Dial Page is buying the channels -- which are located primarily in Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and San Antonio -- from Advanced MobileComm Inc., as well as several other parties.
Further terms weren't disclosed.
Through a series of acquisitions, Dial Page, based in Greenville, S.C., is trying to assemble a wireless communications network that could compete with cellular telephone networks.
Radio-network users such as taxi companies, plumbers and truckers use SMR services.
