Williams Holdings PLC, a London-based industrial conglomerate, reported yesterday that pretax profit for 1993 declined slightly after taking into account a loss from disposal of its engineering business in December.
On the operating level, profit rose 13% to #170.3 million.
Included in Williams pretax results is a #17.1 million loss on the disposal of its engineering business.
This includes a previous write-off to reserves for goodwill of #17.4 million.
Williams said it decided to increase its dividend to keep up with British inflation but noted that the 2% rise isn't commensurate with the underlying earnings growth as the company is aiming to rebuild its dividend reserves.
