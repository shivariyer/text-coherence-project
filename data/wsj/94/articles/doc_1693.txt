Congratulations are due to Rep. Danny Rostenkowski for his primary victory Tuesday.
Pulling 50% of the vote, he swamped four challengers.
In case you've forgotten, the Ways and Means Chairman cited the Fifth Amendment in refusing to appear before a grand jury probing allegations arising from the House Post Office scandal.
The investigation is now two years old, and Rep. Rostenkowski's stonewall outlasted the first grand jury.
His Congressional position is crucial to the agenda of President Clinton, who campaigned in his district.
It's also perceived as so important to the city of Chicago that both the Sun-Times and Tribune endorsed him.
On the day before the election, he unveiled a surplus Army helicopter for the Chicago fire department, though the Tribune reported that the chopper on display at Meigs field was borrowed and that his DoD gift won't actually arrive for another two months.
What remains of the Chicago political machine flooded his district with some 1,000 precinct workers to get out his supporters in what proved to be a small turnout.
And it all worked.
Maybe it will be reversed in the fall, since he and Republican Mike Flanagan will square off in a district that went for George Bush in 1988.
But so far the lesson, at least the one sure to be drawn by the rest of the pols, is that despite the electorate's disgust with Washington in general and Congress in particular, enough pork barrel can still trump ethics.
