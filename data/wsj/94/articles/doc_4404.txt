Wyatt Earp's gun control was overruled yesterday, as the City Council in Tombstone, Ariz., repealed its ban on carrying handguns in public.
Some residents, backed by the legal arm of the National Rifle Association, had sued to overturn a 1977 ordinance.
Earlier, in 1881, the storied gunfight at the OK Corral erupted when cowboys of the Clanton Gang refused to disarm.
The Earp brothers and "Doc" Holliday killed three cowboys in 30 seconds.
The cops were supported, the Tombstone Epitaph reported the next day, by "the feeling among the best class of our citizens."
