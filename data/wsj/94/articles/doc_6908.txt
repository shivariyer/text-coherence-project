Scana Corp. expects to report that per-share earnings for the fourth quarter and year "will certainly be in line with, and perhaps be a bit more" than analysts' estimates, said Lawrence M. Gressette Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Scana, a Columbia, S.C., holding company with electric and natural-gas utility operations, is also likely to increase its quarterly dividend of 68.5 cents a share, Mr. Gressette said in an interview.
Analysts have been estimating per-share earnings of about 67 cents for Scana's fourth quarter and about $3.68 for all of 1993.
In the 1992 fourth quarter, the company earned $27.1 million, or 64 cents a share, on revenue of $280 million.
For all of 1992, Scana reported earnings of $117.6 million, or $2.84 a share, on revenue of $1.14 billion.
