A California state appeals court threw out Pilgrim Group Inc.'s libel suit against Morningstar Inc. of Chicago, whose mutual-fund newsletter had criticized two of Pilgrim's 1993 fund ads as misleading.
Filed in state Superior Court in Los Angeles a year ago, the complaint challenged a Morningstar newsletter article titled "Lies, Damn Lies and Fund Advertisements."
In the article, Morningstar chided two Pilgrim ads that ran in The Wall Street Journal for allegedly giving the impression that Pilgrim had managed the five best-performing mutual funds of 1992.
In fact, the newsletter wrote, the Pilgrim funds appeared to rank that highly only when analysed within narrowly defined categories.
Pilgrim, for its part, contended the early-1993 ads had made clear in a footnote that each fund was ranked within its own category.
A trial court denied Morningstar's motion for a "demurrer" to dismiss the suit.
But on Friday the Court of Appeal of the State of California, Second Appellate District, ordered the trial court to dismiss the case, saying, "It is our considered opinion Pilgrim cannot state a cause of action. . ."
The suit had charged Morningstar with libel.
Pilgrim officials couldn't be reached to comment over the weekend.
