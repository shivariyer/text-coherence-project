Directors of Paramount Communications Inc. endorsed a takeover bid by Viacom Inc. over a rival bid by QVC Network Inc. following the final round of bidding in the long-running takeover battle.
Paramount stockholders have until Feb. 14 to decide which of the two offers, each valued at more than $10 billion, to accept.
The board urged shareholders to tender their stock to one or the other bidder, warning that allowing the contest to drag on poses a risk to Paramount's business and could persuade Viacom to drop its offer.
Although Viacom said Friday that it isn't considering dropping its bid, stock traders said that Friday's 96.24-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average might induce investors to make a decision rather than risk a steeper market decline that could cause one or both bidders to reasess their offers.
