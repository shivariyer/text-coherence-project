Alumax Inc., hurt by a world-wide glut of aluminum, said it will close two aluminum-sheet plants, cutting 600 jobs in California and Illinois.
The Norcross, Ga., aluminum company also said it will spend an undisclosed amount to upgrade its other plants.
The cost is included in its previously announced fourth-quarter charge of $57.4 million.
For the quarter, the company reported a net loss of $21.8 million, or 54 cents a share, on sales of $592.8 million.
Alumax, which was spun off from Amax Inc. last year, employs about 14,000 people.
The two plants affected by the cuts are in Riverside, Calif., and Morris, Ill.
The Riverside sheet operation will stop taking new orders immediately and will close permanently as soon as existing orders are filled.
Cast-plate production will continue at that plant, officials said.
The Morris plant will remain open until the end of 1994.
Alumax and other aluminum companies have been battered because worldwide aluminum inventories are too high, pushing prices down to historic lows.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Alumax closed at $26.375, down 75 cents.
