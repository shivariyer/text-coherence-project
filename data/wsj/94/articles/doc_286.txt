Wang Laboratories Inc. said that funds managed by investor Leon Cooperman have become its biggest shareholder.
The funds exchanged bonds acquired while Wang was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings for about three million shares, equal to a 9.7% stake.
Mr. Cooperman disclosed the size of the stake in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Wang emerged from bankruptcy-court protection last September as a provider of software and computer services, having closed most of its manufacturing operations.
It said there aren't any other investors with more than a 5% stake.
