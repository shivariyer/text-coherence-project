A current executive of an American Express Co. unit and one of the unit's former employees pleaded innocent to charges of helping a reputed Mexican drug kingpin launder $30 million.
Antonio Giraldi and Maria Lourdes Reategui are accused of several counts of laundering profits from the alleged drug organization of Juan Garcia Abrego, a Mexican fugitive.
Mr. Giraldi is a senior vice president for American Express Bank International's Miami office, and Ms. Reategui is a former employee of the bank's Los Angeles office.
U.S. Magistrate John William Black tentatively scheduled trial for the two to begin March 4.
The 18-count federal indictment, issued last month, accuses the two of setting up international bank accounts for Ricardo Aguirre Villagomez, a gas-station owner from Matamoros, Mexico, who is named as a key money launderer for the drug ring.
Mr. Garcia Abrego, who is wanted in both the U.S. and Mexico, was accused in a 1990 U.S. indictment of running a Matamoros-based organization that smuggled multiton quantities of cocaine into the U.S. through ties to Colombian drug lords.
