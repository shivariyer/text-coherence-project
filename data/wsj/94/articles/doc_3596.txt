Standard & Poor's Corp. upgraded the company's preferred stock to triple-B-minus from double-B-plus and the company's Bank IV Kansas unit's long-term uninsured certificates of deposit to single-A-minus/A-2 from triple-B-plus/A-2.
S&P said the upgrades reflect the bank holding company's strong capitalization and liquidity and improved earnings performance and asset quality.
Those factors offset continued risks stemming from the company's aggressive growth and limited geographical diversification, S&P said.
