LA QUINTA INNS Inc., San Antonio, Texas, said its board authorized a 3-for-2 common-stock split.
The motel concern said each shareholder will receive one additional share on or about March 15 for each two shares held Feb. 21.
A cash payment will be made in lieu of fractional shares, based on the closing price of common shares on Feb. 21, adjusted to reflect the 3-for-2 split.
The company also said it increased the cash dividend by 50% in conjunction with the split, resulting in a payout at the annual rate of 10 cents a share on postsplit common shares.
After the split, La Quinta Inns will have about 30.4 million shares outstanding.
