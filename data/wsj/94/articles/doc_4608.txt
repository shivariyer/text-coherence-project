Vernon B. Schwartz said he will step down as chairman, chief executive officer and president of Catellus Development Corp., effective June 30.
The move was expected.
Catellus said Mr. Schwartz was resigning to pursue other opportunities.
However, as reported, board members and others close to the company say Mr. Schwartz, 42 years old, was asked to depart after his strategies for turning around the ailing real-estate concern came under fire from directors representing the interests of Calpers, California's huge state employee pension plan, which owns 40% of Catellus's stock.
Catellus said Rod F. Danmeyer and Randall K. Rowe also resigned from the company's board.
Both men were said by people familiar with the company to have been supporters of Mr. Schwartz.
Catellus, one of the nation's largest publicly held real-estate concerns, has been hit by the property bust.
The company had a net loss for the nine months ended Sept. 30 of $34.4 million, or 63 cents a share.
Separately, Catellus said it secured a $280 million first mortgage loan with Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
The new loan refinances a $388 million first mortgage loan.
The new credit carries lower interest rates than the previous loan, but Catellus had to make large principal paydowns and pay other fees to obtain the new funding.
As a result of those costs, Catellus said it will incur a $7.4 million after-tax charge in its fourth quarter.
Word of Mr. Schwartz's planned departure came after the market closed, but the refinancing was announced before trading ended.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Catellus closed at $8, up 62.5 cents.
