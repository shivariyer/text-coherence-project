United Kingdom bank Abbey National PLC announced a 25% increase in pretax profit for 1993 as provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell 20%.
Each of its key U.K. retail-banking, life-assurance and treasury operations improved their performance.
Pretax profit for 1993 rose to #704 million ($1.05 billion), or 29.7 pence a share, from #564 million, or 24.2 pence, a year earlier.
Dividend payout rose 22% to 14 pence compared with 11.5 pence a year earlier.
Debt provisions were down 20% to #218 million from #274 million a year earlier.
Both its pretax profit and dividend payout were higher than market expectations for #672.5 million and 13 pence, respectively.
Abbey National described 1993 as a "successful" year for the bank with its U.K. retail-banking operation "substantially" increasing its share of the mortgage and savings market while serious debt arrears were reduced by one fifth and the number of repossessed properties were halved.
Its treasury operations continued to expand its asset base.
The bank said it expects U.K. net mortgage lending to rise 10% in 1994, and that its bad-debt provisions will fall further in the current year as the trend in house repossessions and mortgage-payments arrears continues downward.
Abbey National said that net interest income rose to 1.34 billion from 1.27 billion in 1992.
Against its profit for the year the bank made an exceptional charge of 30 million for the sale of Cornerstone.
Exceptional items totaled 37 million in 1992.
