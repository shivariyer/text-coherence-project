Lesco Inc. expects 1994 sales to rise more than 15% and earnings to grow by a greater percentage, said William A. Foley, president and chief executive officer.
The growth will result in part from a rapid expansion in Lesco's chain of sales and service centers as well as from rising sales to Home Depot Inc. stores, Mr. Foley said in an interview.
The producer of lawn-care products and equipment, based in the Cleveland suburb of Rocky River, Ohio, is comfortable with analysts' 1994 earnings estimates of 79 cents to 87 cents a share, said Daniel G. Dunstan, executive vice president and chief operating officer.
Sales are expected to total between $192 million and $205 million, he said.
In 1993, Lesco had earnings of $4.8 million, or 68 cents a share, on sales of $166.2 million.
