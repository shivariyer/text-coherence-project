The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Chicago Corp. with violating recordkeeping requirements in connection with non-competitive bidding at Treasury securities auctions.
The two firms settled SEC administrative complaints without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.
Chicago Corp. handed over $250,000 in profits and interest from the transactions in question, and paid a civil penalty of $250,000.
Cantor Fitzgerald paid $90,000 in profits and interest and $100,000 in civil penalties.
Both firms were ordered to cease and desist from further violations of securities laws.
The two separate cases represent the latest SEC enforcement actions to grow out of the 1991 Salomon Brothers Inc.
Treasury bond scandal, and are the most significant actions in the area of noncompetitive bidding.
At issue are alleged abuses of a procedure put in place by Treasury to accommodate smaller, less sophisticated investors.
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is a broker-dealer affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, which has a business relationship with Dow Jones & Co., the publisher of this newspaper.
