Litton Industries Inc.'s Western Atlas Inc. unit said it completed its previously reported $558 million purchase from Dresser Industries Inc. of all stock Western Atlas didn't already own in an oil field services company.
Litton in Beverly Hills, Calif., also said that, on Jan. 14, Western Atlas -- which soon is to be spun off to Litton shareholders -- acquired most of the operating assets of Halliburton Co.'s geological seismic business for about $190 million.
The purchase from Dresser comprised a 29.5% minority stake in an oil field service company.
The payment was in cash and notes.
Litton has owned the other 70.5% of the business, which will become part of the new, independent operation into which Litton has put its nondefense holdings.
A spokesman for Western Atlas, whose shares were to have been spun off to Litton shareholders before the end of 1993 on a 1-for-1 basis, said the transaction has been delayed by the recent purchases.
