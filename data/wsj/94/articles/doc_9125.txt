Winterthur Swiss Insurance Co. said it plans to announce a "major expansion" at a news conference today.
The company didn't provide any more details.
Winterthur shares rose 14 Swiss francs to 820 francs ($554) in trading in Zurich Friday.
There was speculation that Winterthur may announce plans to buy Commerzbank AG's controlling stake in German insurer Deutschen Beamtenversicherungskasse, or DBV.
Commerzbank has also called a news conference for today.
Commerzbank holds a stake of 50% plus one share in the German insurer, which has 3.4 billion marks ($1.94 billion) in annual premiums.
Winterthur declined to comment on the speculation.
Last month, Winterthur sold its 28% stake in Switzerland's medium-size Helvetia Versicherungegen insurance group, which has a strong market position in Germany.
