Another sell-off in the bond market left stocks lower, but the losses were tempered by technical-related buying.
Although the Treasury's 30-year bond skidded more than 3/4 point, lifting its yield to a nine-month high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped just 7.32 to 3824.42.
Broad-based indexes that track New York Stock Exchange shares also posted moderate losses, while prices gained ground on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

"I think the stock market turned in a good performance given the backdrop," said Ralph Bloch, a market strategist at Raymond James & Associates.
Other steep drops in the bond market in the past several weeks have triggered much sharper reactions in equities.
Observers tied the buoyancy in part to buyers lured into the market by the sharp drop in many share prices in the past week.
Some analysts said selling had beaten the market down to what technical analysts call an "oversold" condition.
The snap-back began Wednesday, when the industrial average managed to turn around a morning loss of more than 50 points to close with a 22.51 gain.

Leon Brand, global market specialist at NatWest Securities, said continued signs of strength in the economy helped to buoy stocks.

An initial public offering of 70 million shares of Global Privatization Fund was priced at $15 each through underwriters led by Kidder Peabody.
