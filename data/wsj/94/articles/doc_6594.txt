DEER PARK REFINING L.P., Houston, a joint venture of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co. and a Petroleos Mexicanos SA unit, sold $400 million in notes in a private placement to institutional buyers.
The notes, priced at 0.77 point over the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, carry a 6.47% coupon rate and have a 10-year weighted average life with a 15year final maturity.
The transaction closed Monday.
Proceeds will be used to partly pay for a $1 billion upgrade at a refinery jointly owned by Pemex and Shell at Shell's Deer Park, Texas, manufacturing complex.
The project is expected to be completed in 1995.
