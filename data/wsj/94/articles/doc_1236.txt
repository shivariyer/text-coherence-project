GITANO GROUP Inc., the jeanswear maker, spent $20 million a year on all types of advertising and promotion.
A Feb. 18 page-one article said incorrectly that the company spent $20 million a year on TV advertising alone.
The article also mentioned the bar mitzvah of the son of Gitano's former president, Haim Dabah, at which the children played a game of "diving for dollars."
The "dollars" used in the game, according to some who attended the party, were actually play money.
