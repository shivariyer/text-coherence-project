Matra-Hachette SA Chairman Jean-Luc Lagardere said Monday that he has proposed a public exchange offer for all of the capital of Matra-Hachette, offering to swap Matra-Hachette shares for those of its parent company, Lagardere Groupe SA.
One Matra-Hachette share would be exchanged for one Lagardere Groupe share plus one warrant.
Mr. Lagardere also said he expects Matra-Hachette's 1993 profit to exceed 600 million francs ($101.5 million), up from 1992's net income of 354 million francs.
Mr. Lagardere said the group will follow through only if it is able to acquire 65% of Matra-Hachette's capital.
Lagardere now holds 37.6% of Matra-Hachette's capital and 61.2% of the voting rights.
Lagardere shares were suspended at 160 francs ($27.05).
Those of Matra Hachette were suspended at 165.4 francs.
