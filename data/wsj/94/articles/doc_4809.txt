Rite Aid Corp. wants to buy back its shares, even though a lot of its shareholders don't seem very interested.
The drug retailer, one of the nation's largest, said directors authorized repurchase of as many as five million of its shares from time to time in the open market.
A week ago, the company, as part of a restructuring announced last month, had offered to buy as many as 22 million, or 25% of its shares, in a so-called Dutch auction at a price range of $16 a share to $18.50 a share.
Dutch auctions, in which a company states the number of shares it will buy in a certain range without setting a single purchase price, are often oversubscribed.
But Rite Aid investors apparently believed they would do better to hang on to their shares.
Only 2.1 million shares, or 2.4%, of Rite Aid's shares outstanding, were tendered in the auction, and Rite Aid bought all the shares at $18.50 a share.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Rite Aid shares closed at $18.875, up 12.5 cents.
"We were somewhat disappointed" in the results of the auction, a Rite Aid spokesman said, but "if you look at the history of Dutch auctions, it moves all over the place.
People refocused on our restructuring efforts and thought that our stock had more potential than the $18.50-a-share offer.
As part of the restructuring, the company said it planned to sell four noncore businesses, close 200 "underperforming" drugstores -- resulting in a $91 million charge -- and launch the buyback in the Dutch auction.
Richard Church, an analyst at Smith Barney Shearson, a unit of Travelers Inc., said "basically investors felt like the price range the company had established was a little bit on the low side."
