Westcott Communications Inc. sweetened its previously spurned offer to acquire Sandy Corp.
Westcott, Carrollton, Texas, an operator of specialized satellite-television networks, said it offered to exchange one share of its stock for each 1.896 shares of Sandy stock.
Westcott had previously offered to exchange one share for each 2.81 shares of Sandy stock, a bid that had been valued at about $19 million.
Sandy rejected the offer as undervalued.
Westcott has been eyeing a possible acquisition of Sandy Corp. since it first acquired a 6% stake in the provider of corporate training programs in 1990.
