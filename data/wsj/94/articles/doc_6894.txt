General Motors Corp. expects to report that its huge finance unit earned about $1 billion last year, Robert T. O'Connell, chairman of General Motors Acceptance Corp., said.
Ordinarily, that would be no big accomplishment.
For each of the past nine years, GMAC has contributed about that much to its parent's bottom line.
Such an outcome is also reflected in Wall Street's estimates that the parent company next week will report net income of more than $2 billion for 1993.
But 1993 was no ordinary year.
As the year opened, GMAC was still recovering from a scandal that had led to a housecleaning of top management; the parent's credit rating had been downgraded, jeopardizing GMAC's ability to raise cheap funds; $15 billion of bank credit lines were due for renegotiation, and worried managers were embarking on a plan to shrink the asset base.
"It was very scary," Mr. O'Connell acknowledged.
GMAC responded by growing more aggressive in meeting competitive threats at the retail level, reorganizing and slimming its operations to cut costs and seeking out creative, new financing sources.
It was also lucky: Interest rates declined; the money markets still liked GMAC commercial paper, despite its lower rating; and car sales improved.
Mr. O'Connell said GMAC's share of business involving GM dealers was back to 31% by December, after dropping as low as 24% in March 1993.
The figure had been about 33% in 1992, and Mr. O'Connell expects it to eventually return to its historical level of 35%.
GMAC's chief mission is to act as banker to GM dealers, financing their purchases of cars and trucks, and making loans to their retail customers.
With about $80 billion of assets, GMAC is bigger than all but three U.S. banks.
