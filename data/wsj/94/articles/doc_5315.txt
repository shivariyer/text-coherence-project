Oracle Corp. unveiled new multimedia software in its quest to provide the technology to bring interactive services, such as movies on demand and shopping, to homes.
The Redwood Shores, Calif., software company said the products include Oracle Media Server, a digital "multimedia library" for storing, retrieving and managing video, audio, text and other data; Oracle Media Objects, a tool for software developers to create multimedia interactive services and CD-ROM programs; and Oracle Media Net, which connects the home TV to the multimedia library via phone lines, satellite broadcasts and cable.
Oracle's new technology, broadcast yesterday to New York, Washington and Tokyo in a live video hookup from CBS studios in Los Angeles, has gained support from 20 companies, including Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and Washington Post Co.
Separately, Oracle and Motorola Inc., Schaumburg, Ill., said they have agreed to work together to provide wireless transfer of corporate data served through Oracle databases and Oracle Media Server.
Products using Oracle's database and network technology and Motorola's Mobile Networks Integration wireless technology are to be announced later this year.
