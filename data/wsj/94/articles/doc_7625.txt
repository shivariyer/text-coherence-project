Trinova Corp., a Maumee, Ohio, maker of automotive, aerospace and defense components, said it sees continued improvement in the U.S. industrial markets but a depressed Europe could hurt sales growth in that market this year.
Trinova said it earned $4.5 million, or 16 cents a share, in the fourth quarter.
Included in those results is a charge of $4.7 million, or 17 cents a share, related to a provision for additional value-added taxes owed in prior years in Brazil.
In the year-earlier quarter, Trinova earned $6.1 million, or 21 cents a share.
Sales slipped to $401.7 million from $431.6 million.
"We expect to see continued improvement in the U.S. industrial markets in 1994, which will help strengthen our industrial margins further," said Darryl F. Allen, Trinova's chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Allen said that Europe "seems to be stabilizing" but expects that the "continued depressed levels of European auto production and severe price competition will inhibit our sales growth in 1994."
