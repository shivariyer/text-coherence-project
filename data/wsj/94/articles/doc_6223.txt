Roberto Mazzotta, the chairman of Italy's largest savings bank, surrendered to police yesterday, a week after prosecutors ordered his arrest on charges of corruption and illegal financing of political parties.
Mr. Mazzotta, a former Christian Democratic deputy and the head of Cassa di Risparmio Delle Provincie Lombarde, or Cariplo, turned himself in at the Italian-Swiss border, a Milan police officer reported.
The banker was later taken to Milan to be questioned by judges of the so-called Mani Pulite (Clean Hands) staff who have been investigating a nationwide kickback scandal for the past two years.
About 3,000 politicians and businessmen have been implicated in the scandal.
Mr. Mazzotta and three other top Cariplo executives faced charges stemming from kickbacks allegedly paid by the bank on real-estate investments out of Cariplo's pension funds.
Mr. Mazzotta was on a business trip abroad when the Cariplo scandal broke last week.
A vice president and two bank directors were arrested last Monday.
