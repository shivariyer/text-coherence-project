Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on about $220 million of the debt of this maker of automotive, aerospace, materials-handling and packaging products.
The ratings concern said it lowered the company's subordinated debt to triple-C-plus from single-B-minus, and also removed the rating from CreditWatch.
S&P said the downgrade reflects Interlake's "weakened financial profile."
Although the company recently negotiated relaxed covenants on its bank-credit facility to prevent a potential default, S&P said an "onerous debt burden and weak operating performance place the firm under continued financial stress."
S&P said that while prospects in domestic markets are strengthening, weak foreign-market conditions will limit the improvement in earnings and cash flow.
Further, it said the company's ratings outlook is "negative," and could be lowered if the company fails to take sufficient steps to relieve financial stress, or if operations fail to show significant improvement over the next few quarters.
Interlake had no comment on the action.
