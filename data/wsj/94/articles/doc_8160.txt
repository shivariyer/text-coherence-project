State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the biggest property and casualty insurer in the U.S., said it expects to receive 115,000 claims from victims of last week's earthquake in Los Angeles.
That's four times the number the company received after the San Francisco earthquake in 1989, when State Farm paid $120 million in claims.
State Farm did not say how much it expects to pay Los Angeles claimants.
Sean Mooney, an economist with the Insurance Information Institute, said the average insurance claim is likely to be smaller from the Los Angeles quake than from the San Francisco quake because property values are lower in the hardest-hit areas.
Another reason is many of the claims won't be large enough to trigger a payment because of the high deductibles.
Unlike in San Francisco, the federal government is encouraging homeowners to file claims -- even if they don't top the deductible -- because it will speed up paperwork for federal-disaster assistance.
Analysts expect the insurance industry to pay about $1.5 billion to $2 billion on the earthquake.
State Farm writes about 25% of all homeowner policies in California, but is not a major writer of commercial insurance.
The industry paid $1 billion in claims on the San Francisco earthquake.
If State Farm gets as many earthquake claims as it expects, it would be one of the largest claims totals in company history.
Its biggest catastrophe was 1992's Hurricane Andrew, when the company received 160,000 claims and paid $3.6 billion.
The typical earthquake claim is smaller than the typical hurricane claim because of a much higher deductible.
