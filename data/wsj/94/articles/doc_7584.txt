The House Banking Committee, doing an end-run around the Federal Reserve, obtained three years of transcripts of Fed deliberations from the Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Mich., and released excerpts yesterday.
Prodded by the committee, the Fed recently agreed to release edited versions of transcripts that are more than five years old, but hasn't yet done so.
Fed officials are to decide next month whether to continue to make and release transcripts of future meetings.
Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) said the transcripts released by the committee, which were edited by the National Archives, prove "that the Federal Reserve has no grounds for keeping this information secret."
He has proposed that the Fed release transcripts of its meetings within 60 days.
The late Arthur Burns, who was chairman of the Fed, gave the Ford library his personal papers and 3,000 pages of transcripts of Fed policy meetings from March 1976 through March 1978.
The Fed hadn't any comment.
