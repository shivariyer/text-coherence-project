News Corp.'s Fox Inc. signed on as a partner in the National Football League's plan to revive World League football in Europe in April 1995.
The two entities will be equal partners in the venture.
Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but sources familiar with the project said the initial investment will be about $40 million to $50 million.
The new World League will be comprised of six European teams, including the London Monarchs, Barcelona Dragons and Frankfurt Galaxy.
The three were part of the original World League which played in 1991 and 1992.
An additional three teams will be chosen from among several European cities.
The original World League included seven North American teams, which proved to be the league's downfall.
American viewers weren't interested in the spring football games, although Europeans were.
The deal is the second major football play for Fox.
In December, Fox's broadcasting network paid $1.56 billion for rights to broadcast the NFL's National Football Conference games for four years.
The television package for the new league hasn't been determined, but it is expected that at least some of the games will appear on News Corp.'s BSkyB satellite television service in Britain.
