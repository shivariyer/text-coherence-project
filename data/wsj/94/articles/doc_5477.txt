In her Jan. 18 letter responding to my Dec. 23 editorial-page article "President's Costly Budget-Buster," Nancy-Ann Min of the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to the central theme -- that both theory and history strongly suggest that adoption of a massive new entitlement program will lead to a massive expansion of budget deficits.
Ms. Min dodges this critical issue by focusing her response on side issues, but even these comments reflect a level of inaccuracy that has come to characterize the Clinton administration.
She attempts to defend the administration's budget numbers by asserting that a study by Lewin-VHI came to the same conclusion; yet the Lewin-VHI study was not designed to ascertain the reliability of those figures.
Instead, the report measured the financial impact of the Clinton proposal using the heroic assumption that the plan's price controls and expenditure limits would operate exactly as the administration predicts.
As I stated in my article, however, these assumptions are grossly optimistic.
Ms. Min's claims are somewhat like debating the abilities of flying elephants without ever confirming the existence of such creatures.
Ms. Min also berates me for not mentioning the OMB scenarios that indicate the health plan could produce even more savings than advertised.
She should have read more carefully.
I specifically noted that the numbers I used were part of an exercise to look at best-case and worst-case numbers.
My analysis, which she neglected to counter, is that so-called worst-case numbers are the realistic ones to use when predicting the cost of new entitlement programs.
