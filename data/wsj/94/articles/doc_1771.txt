Dutch/Anglo food and household-products group Unilever NV said it has received permission from the European Union Commission to purchase French ice cream and frozen-foods maker Ortiz-Miko.
Unilever offered to sell off Ortiz-Miko's German ice cream division Warncke, among other concessions, to gain the EU approval.
