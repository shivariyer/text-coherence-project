William S. Kelly, president and chief executive officer of Saab Cars USA Inc., resigned, surprising dealers and staffers.
He said the move will allow him to pursue other opportunities in the auto industry.
"I'll just see what lies ahead," said Mr. Kelly, 45 years old, who became president of the Swedish auto maker's U.S. sales unit in 1991, after starting a career with Saab in 1980.
Saab officials said Mr. Kelly was not dismissed and would not be replaced.
Instead, James P. Crumlish, 49, is adding Mr. Kelly's chores to his current position as Saab's regional director for the Americas.
Under Mr. Kelly's tenure, Saab reorganized in the U.S., moving its sales headquarters to Georgia from Connecticut, while laying off 44% of its work force in the process.
Mr. Kelly also played a key role in keeping the auto maker's dealership body intact, while the company endured a drought in new products.
In November, Saab introduced a remodeled five-door version of its Saab 900, and is expected to introduce a three-door version in April and a convertible this summer.
Saab operates as a 50-50 venture controlled by General Motors Corp. and Saab Motors AB.
Through February, Saab's U.S. sales were off by 14% for the '94 model year, while calendar-year sales showed a 9% improvement.
