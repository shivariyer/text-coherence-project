High Plains Corp. expects to report that net income fell about 18% in its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, said Ray G. Friend, chief financial officer.
Mr. Friend said he agreed with analysts' estimates that the Wichita, Kan., ethanol producer's net would be in the range of $1.7 million, or 25 cents to 30 cents a share, compared with $1.7 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier.
Common shares outstanding rose to five million from three million a year earlier.
Mr. Friend blamed the lower earnings on higher grain prices, which raised the cost of producing ethanol.
Another factor was the drop in ethanol prices caused by lower wholesale gasoline prices, he said.
High Plain expects to report that sales rose 16% to $9.6 million from $8.3 million.
For the fiscal first half, Mr. Friend expects to report that net fell 17%, to $2 million, or 38 cents a share, from $2.4 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier, on sales of $17.8 million, up about 11% from $16 million.
