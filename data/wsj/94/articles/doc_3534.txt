New Valley Corp., which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, reported a fourth-quarter profit, due in part because it isn't required to make certain high-interest payments.
Net income was $9.8 million, compared with a loss of $5.8 million a year ago.
On a per-share basis, New Valley in Paramus, N.J., reported a 1993 fourth-quarter loss of four cents a share, compared with a loss of 12 cents a share a year earlier, reflecting undeclared preferred dividends of $18.2 million in the more recent quarter and $15.9 million a year earlier.
According to a spokesman, New Valley would have had interest expenses of $11.7 million in the fourth quarter had it not been under Chapter 11 protection.
Revenue rose 9.5% to $121.8 million from $111.3 million, due to continued growth in New Valley's main money-transfer business, which is operated by the company's unit, Western Union Financial Services Inc.
New Valley entered Chapter 11 protection in March 1993.
