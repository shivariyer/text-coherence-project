A group led by NuMed Home Health Care Inc. is seeking to oust a majority of the directors of Hospital Staffing Services Inc. and ultimately remove some of the senior managers, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
The NuMed group said in the filing that it is taking this action because "the management and current directors of HSS are not prepared to react in a prompt and decisive manner to serious problems confronting HSS."
NuMed, a closely held provider of home health-care services based in Independence, Ohio, said it holds about a 6.3% stake in HSS.
A spokesman for HSS, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., provider of medical personnel for health-care facilities, said the company will issue a statement this morning.
HSS reported a $5.33 million loss for the nine months ended Aug. 31, compared with a $1.96 million profit a year earlier.
Ninemonth revenue fell to $62.8 million from $93.5 million.
