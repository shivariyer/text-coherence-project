Standard & Poor's Corp., citing the increased competition USAir Group Inc. faces from low-cost carriers, placed about $2.9 billion of USAir's long-term debt on CreditWatch for possible downgrades.
The rating concern said last week's decision by USAir to sharply cut fares in about a quarter of its markets "probably will produce heavy losses, even if it is successful in countering rival airlines' competitive inroads."
USAir slashed fares as much as 50% on many of its business routes in an effort to match those offered by Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines.
But S&P said the new fares aren't expected to generate enough traffic to offset the resulting lower yields, a measure of revenue for each seat.
Philip Baggaley, vice president of S&P's transportation ratings group, said that with Continental's low-fare program diverting traffic, "USAir was in trouble either way.
They didn't have any easy choices."
He also pointed to yesterday's announcement by Southwest that it would add more gates to its operation at Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
"That increases the threat," said Mr. Baggaley, "and they're already causing some trouble."
S&P said USAir's plan to lower its costs by boosting operating efficiencies on its short-haul routes will help the problem over time.
But "further concessions from employees may be necessary to return to profitability," the agency said.
USAir, based in Arlington, Va., declined to comment.
Among the many USAir securities placed under review are the company's airport revenue bonds, currently rated double-B-minus.
