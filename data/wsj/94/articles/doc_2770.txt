Japanese toy maker Bandai Co. will build new production facilities in Vietnam and Mexico this year to boost overseas production and cut costs.
Makoto Yamashina, Bandai president and chief executive officer, said the move is part of the company's efforts to globalize in the face of a shrinking Japanese toy market and the increased popularity of Bandai products overseas.
The unexpected U.S. popularity of Bandai's line of "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," character dolls based on a popular Japanese television show, has led the company to speed up production plans significantly, he said.
Bandai expects to post a pretax profit of 5 billion yen ($47.3 million) for the year ending in March, on sales of 170 billion yen.
Mr. Yamashina said that because of strong interest in the company's toy, pretax profit for the following business year will at least double.
