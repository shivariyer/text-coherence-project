Arabian Oil Co and Teikoku Oil Co. have abandoned the No. 2 test well in their offshore Vietnam concession after hitting gas.
An official at Arabian Oil in Tokyo said the partners are planning to return to their first test well in the same exploration block, which had also been put on hold after finding gas reserves.
The companies plan to dig sidetrack wells off the No. 1 well to continue their search for oil deposits.
He said the consortium isn't currently considering developing the natural gas reserves that were found, saying that their basic mission is to search for crude oil.
The rights to the 05-3 exploration block lying just to the south of the promising Dai Hung, or Big Bear, oil field, is 55% owned by Arabian Oil and 45% by Teikoku Oil.
Mobil Corp. of the U.S. has a farm-in contract with Arabian Oil for 25% of the block, though the transfer hasn't been completed yet as the U.S. has only recently lifted its embargo against Vietnam, the Arabian Oil official said.
