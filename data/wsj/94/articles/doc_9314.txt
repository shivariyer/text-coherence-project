L.A. Gear Inc. estimated a loss from continuing operations of as much as $16 million for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30, adding that excess inventories continue to depress earnings.
For fiscal 1993, the footwear company said it expects to report an overall loss of as much as $41.2 million, or $1.80 a share, despite a one-time credit of $2.7 million and continuing restructuring efforts designed to cut costs, improve margins and reduce employees.
In fiscal 1992, L.A. Gear had a loss of $72 million, or $3.76 a share, including a charge of more than $35 million for restructuring and settlement of three shareholder lawsuits.
For the 1992 fourth quarter, L.A. Gear had a loss of $29.8 million, or $1.39 a share.
The anticipated 1993 loss comes despite various efforts by the company to improve international results.
L.A. Gear acquired its previously independent distributors in several European countries, and last month it moved to set up its own distribution system in the Far East.
In October the company posted its first quarterly profit in three years, but it indicated at the time that lower-than-expected profit margins and changing consumer preferences were likely to affect future financial results.
The company attributed its smaller anticipated loss for fiscal 1993 to strong children's shoe sales, improved average prices and reduced administrative costs.
To trim excess inventory of about $106 million at fiscal year end, the company said it may increase sales through discount outlets, even though that would reduce gross profit margins.
Inventory was $62 million a year earlier.
