Digital Equipment Corp. unveiled two new workstations, as well as equipment for making mobile computers work as part of a computer network.
Digital, Maynard, Mass., said it will replace its entry-level 300L workstation with the Model 300 LX, priced at $5,295.
The color workstation, with high-resolution graphics, uses a 125-megahertz Alpha microprocessor.
The maker of data-processing equipment also unveiled a more powerful workstation, with a 175-megahertz Alpha microprocessor, with a base price of $7,995.
Digital said its Roamabout software and hardware, designed for wireless, mobile computing, includes software that provides permanent network "addresses" that will follow users as they travel.
Other new Roamabout products include wireless network adaptors that fit into a credit-card-sized slot on a portable computer.
Equipping a portable PC for wireless computing with its products would cost around $600, Digital said.
