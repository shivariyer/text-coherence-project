A tumble in bond prices gave stock market investors an excuse to take profits after the recent rally.
The dollar fell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 14.35 points to 3964.01.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.99 to 479.62 and the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 3.23 to 797.24.
All three hit record highs on Monday.
Bond prices were pummeled by further signs of a strengthening economy.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported a stronger-than-expected jump in its index of manufacturing activity for January.
Analysts said bond traders were especially concerned about a sharp rise in the price component of the index, raising fears of inflation.
Also, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose a better-than-expected 2.6% in December.
Analysts added that perhaps most troubling to bond investors was the unexpected announcement by Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman David Mullins that he will resign his post this month to join the private sector.
His resignation leaves two vacancies, with the impending departure of Fed Governor Wayne Angell this month following the end of his term in January.
Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist at NationsBank, said bond traders reacted negatively because they feared Mr. Mullins's resignation gives the Clinton administration a greater chance to influence the makeup of the board.
"Most likely, Mullins's replacement will be more aligned with the administration not only on bank regulatory policy but also on monetary policy," Mr. Levy said.
