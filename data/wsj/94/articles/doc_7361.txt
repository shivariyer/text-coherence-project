Buoyed by strong growth in computer networking, Chipcom Corp. will report sharply higher fourth-quarter net on a 60% revenue jump to more than $43 million, says Rob Held, president and chief executive.
The maker of computer-network hubs will exceed most analysts' quarterly profit estimates of $4 million, or 41 cents a share, on 15% more shares, Mr. Held says.
He also says the company "is poised to grow very rapidly again in 1994," adding that he is confident Chipcom can meet analysts' estimates of $215 million of revenue for the year.
In the 1992 fourth quarter, Chipcom reported net of $2.46 million, or 27 cents a share, on revenue of $27.77 million.
The latest results establish Chipcom among the top three makers of network hubs, after SynOptics Communications Inc. and Cabletron Systems Corp.
Hubs are intelligent switching systems that direct traffic in computer networks.
Mr. Held estimated that sales through a new marketing agreement with International Business Machines Corp. rose during the quarter and now comprise about 25% of overall sales.
Sales through Digital Equipment Corp., an earlier Chipcom partner, have fallen as Digital's sales force has begun pushing its internally developed network-hub product line.
For the year, Mr. Held indicated Chipcom will post net of more than $14 million, or $1.43 a share, compared with 1992 net of $8.45 million, or 94 cents a share, on fewer shares.
