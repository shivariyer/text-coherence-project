The European Union Commission approved a planned mobile telecommunications linkup between Mannessmann Eurokom GmbH, a unit of Mannesmann AG, and RWE-Energie AG, a unit of RWE AG.
The panel said the companies' planned joint venture in the mobile data transmission services filed would be good for competition, noting that only Deutsche Bundespost Telekom is active in the market now.
The commission said the German Ministry for Postal Services and Telecommunications had made E.U. approval of the linkup a precondition for granting an operating license to the new company.
