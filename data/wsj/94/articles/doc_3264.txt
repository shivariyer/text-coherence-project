DNA Plant Technology Corp. said it received a new patent on gene-suppression technology that it uses in most of its genetic engineering.
DNA said the Transwitch technology gives it broader patent protection on its method for genetically engineering plants by turning off targeted genes.
DNA has used the method to develop tomatoes that can stay fresh for several months.
The company also received a U.S. patent for creating sweeter peas by slowing the natural conversion of sugar to starch.
