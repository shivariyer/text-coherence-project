S.G. Warburg & Co., in a bid to bolster its U.S. stock business, hired a veteran Goldman, Sachs & Co. syndicate manager to head its syndicate group.
The hiring of David Miller, 51 years old, is a coup of sorts for the U.S. unit of S.G. Warburg Group PLC, which is looking to cash in on the boom for new stock issues.
Mr. Miller was in Goldman's syndicate department for 25 years.
Among Mr. Miller's duties at Warburg will be the structuring, syndication and pricing of stock and stock-linked offerings.
"This is an opportunity to build a business," Mr. Miller said in an interview.
"At Goldman, I was sort of like a brick in the wall; here I'll be a bricklayer building the wall," he said.
Mr. Miller is among a group of former Goldman stock executives now at Warburg.
Other former Goldman executives include Howard Grace, head of stock capital markets; Michael Cohrs, head of global stock capital markets; and Clint Brown, head of sales and trading.
