Hanson PLC said Hanson America Inc., an indirect subsidiary, completed two new senior debt financings with the closing of a new $3.5 billion bank facility and the issuance of $1.25 billion nominal of senior exchangeable discount notes due March 1, 2001.
The $3.5 billion bank facility was substantially oversubscribed, with total commitments of $8.6 billion received from a consortium of 60 banks.
David H. Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, the U.S. arm of Hanson PLC, said proceeds will be used to retire existing bank debt and to complete the final phase of the refinancing of the high coupon debt of Quantum Chemical Corp., acquired in September 1993.
