Seagull Energy Corp. said it wants to raise $140 million by creating a new class of common stock to reflect the performance of its Anchorage, Alaska, natural-gas utility.
Seagull, a growing Gulf Coast gas exploration and production, marketing and pipeline company, has owned the Anchorage utility since 1985.
The company said the new class of stock would be called Enstar Alaska Group common stock; its underlying operations currently account for about one-quarter of Seagull's revenue.
The company said it intends to offer about 7.5 million Enstar shares that would pay an initial dividend of $1.10 a share annually.
The offering is subject to shareholder approval set for the 1994 annual meeting on June 1.
Seagull said it would pay down debt of non-Alaskan operations with the proceeds.
A company spokesman said that as Seagull becomes more of an exploration and production company, creating the new stock made sense from an investor's perspective.
"Wall Street has said it would appreciate us more if we were a pure play," the spokesman said.
The spokesman noted that Seagull would maintain ownership and operating control of the Anchorage utility, which serves 88,000 customers.
In 1993, the utility had revenue of about $100 million and an operating profit of $19 million.
The entire company last year had revenue of $377.2 million and net income of $27.2 million, or 76 cents a share.
Seagull said it retained Lehman Brothers Inc. as its financial adviser for the stock proposal.
