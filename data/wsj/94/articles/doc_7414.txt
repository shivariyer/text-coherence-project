Lincare Holdings Inc. said it is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney's office for the Middle District of Florida for services it provided to a Florida pharmacy that supplied medications to home respiratory patients.
Lincare, a home-health-care company based in Clearwater, Fla., said it provided various marketing, field-administration and patient services to the pharmacy.
The contracts with the pharmacy were in effect from February 1989 to April 1992 and accounted for less than 1% of Lincare's revenue in that period, the company said.
Lincare executives said that the company was cooperating with the investigation and that they will show that services were "provided in accordance with all applicable federal laws."
