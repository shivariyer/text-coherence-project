Only a few days after acquiring 24.9% of the British daily the Independent, Irish newspaper magnate Tony O'Reilly continued his international buying spree by purchasing 31% of Argus Newspapers, South Africa's largest newspaper group.
The value of the transaction wasn't disclosed and depends in part on the future flotation of part of the remainder of Argus stock, but Mr. O'Reilly said it involved "a ballpark figure" of about 125 million rand ($36.4 million).
Argus controls seven dailies, five weekend newspapers and one weekly newspaper.
Its dominant position in the media had recently come under attack by the African National Congress, which objects to the way the country's economy is concentrated in the hands of a few corporate behemoths.
The stake Mr. O'Reilly is purchasing is to be bought from its major shareholders, Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co. and Anglo American Corp. -- a giant conglomerate that had been eager to divest itself of its holding to diffuse the ownership complaints.
