Riding a boom in trading and portfolio management, Credit Suisse reported a 53% surge in 1993 profit.
Profit last year soared to 1.46 billion Swiss francs ($1.02 billion) from 955 million francs in 1992.
The profit gains came despite an 87% increase in write-downs, provisions and loan losses.
Although Credit Suisse had long been expected to report record profits, James Stettler, analyst at London-based Enskilda Research, said, "Credit Suisse's earnings were above expectations."
The group's trading income more than doubled to 3.4 billion francs in 1993 from 1.5 billion francs in 1992, accounting for 37% of all revenue.
Credit Suisse, which isn't publicly listed, accounts for the bulk of the earnings of its Swiss parent, CS Holding AG.
