French sporting-goods company Skis Rossignol, Paris, said it expects to report consolidated net income of close to 100 million francs ($17 million) for the year ending March 31, almost three times the year-earlier 36.6 million francs.
The company said its dividend "will reflect the expected trend in earnings" and will virtually double.
It paid out a net dividend of 12 francs last year.
Analysts said the earnings projection was better than they had expected.
Skis Rossignol said consolidated revenue in the current year is expected to rise more than 12% from the 1.69 billion francs a year earlier.
Skis Rossignol said sales were boosted by good snowfalls.
Ski-boot sales are up 25%, and the company's two brands, Lange and Rossignol, together hold close to 17% of the world market.
Looking ahead, Skis Rossignol said it's confident about the future as a result of new lines of skis, boots and golf equipment, improved productivity and no foreign-exchange exposure.
Sales should rise more than 10% this year, and profit should grow at an even faster pace, it said.
