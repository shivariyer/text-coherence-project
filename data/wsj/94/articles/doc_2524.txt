As an epidemiologist and physician, I am greatly concerned by the possible repercussions of the agreement of a multibillion-dollar settlement by Dow Corning, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Baxter Healthcare (Feb. 14.)
I am currently the principal investigator of the Women's Health Survey, an ongoing study of 10,000 women that is exploring the possible links between cosmetic breast implants and long-term illnesses.
We are still actively recruiting study participants, and we have not yet reached any conclusions about possible health effects.
We expect that it will be at least another year before the study is concluded.
Women participating in the study have already contacted me inquiring whether this agreement nullifies the need for our research.
This common perception can undermine the basis of medical research.
Women who learn of this settlement may assume that the breast implant controversy has been resolved.
On the contrary, without the input of these women, we will not be able to complete our study and provide women with the answers they need.
Such settlements can never mark the end of the search for truth.
Paolo G. Toniolo, M.D.
