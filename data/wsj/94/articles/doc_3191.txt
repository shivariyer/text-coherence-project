FHP International Corp. signed a definitive agreement to acquire TakeCare Inc. for about $1.1 billion in cash and securities, or $80 a share, in an attempt to create one of the nation's largest health maintenance organizations.
The companies said they will have combined revenue of about $3.25 billion this year with more than 1.6 million members in California, seven other states, and Guam.
The acquisition, which the companies expect to complete by the end of June, will facilitate FHP's enrollment of new Medicare members in California and Colorado.
The agreement underscores the trend toward consolidation in the health-care industry as companies scramble to respond to changes in the managed-care field and prepare for proposals to overhaul the nation's health-care system.
The price was substantially higher than the $829 million in cash and securities, or $62 a share, that FHP had agreed to pay to acquire TakeCare in January.
After some disgruntled TakeCare shareholders filed a lawsuit to block that deal, TakeCare put itself on the auction block.
FHP was determined not to let TakeCare get away.
"We decided that the value was there for us to compete in the auction, and we went to levels we thought were appropriate for our shareholders," said Westcott W. Price III, president and chief executive officer of FHP, based in Fountain Valley, Calif.
"Of all the combinations in this industry, this one has the most wonderful opportunities for growth."
TakeCare shares soared on the announcement, jumping 12% to close Friday at $75.25, up $7.875, on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
FHP shares, also traded on Nasdaq, fell $1.75, or 6%, to $26.75.
Analysts said TakeCare extracted a higher price than they expected.
"FHP gave up almost a year's growth in earnings to get the deal done," said Ed Keaney at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. in St. Louis, who thought TakeCare would command between $72 and $75 a share.
He said the deal would reduce FHP's earnings for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, to about $1.75 a share, about 10 cents to 15 cents a share lower than he previously had projected.
Under the $80-a-share agreement, holders of each TakeCare share will receive $28 in cash, $40 of a new issue of convertible preferred stock and $12 in FHP common stock.
The preferred shares will pay an annual dividend of between 4.7% and 5% and are convertible into FHP common at $31 a share.
TakeCare's directors met on Wednesday and selected the FHP offer "because it was their view that it offered the greatest value for shareholders," said a spokesman for the Concord, Calif., HMO.
The decision was endorsed by all eight directors, including three who had opposed the original FHP offer.
Two of the earlier dissenters represent the Hillman Foundation, Pittsburgh, one of TakeCare's largest holders.
TakeCare holders led by investor Henry L. Hillman brought the suit to block the first FHP agreement, charging that the TakeCare board wasn't maximizing shareholder value.
The suit will probably be dropped now, FHP's Mr. Price said Friday.
TakeCare's board acted after United Healthcare Corp., Minnetonka, Minn., said last week that it wouldn't pursue a TakeCare acquisition.
Analysts speculated that other bidders included Foundation Health Corp., Rancho Cordova, Calif., and PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., Cypress, Calif.
Those two companies declined comment.
FHP's Mr. Price said the deal will immediately allow FHP to expand its Medicare program.
Under rules set by the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, HMOs can't have more Medicare members than commercial members in any geographic area.
TakeCare "has a lot of commercial members and we have almost none" in northern California and Colorado, he said.
TakeCare will be operated as a separate FHP subsidiary, and TakeCare's management, including President R. Judd Jessup, will remain in place, Mr. Price said.
