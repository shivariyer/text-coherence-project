Swedish banking group Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken said it swung to a 357 million krona ($44.5 million) operating profit in 1993 from a 5.37 billion krona loss in 1992.
S-E Banken attributed its return to a small operating profit to a strong increase in the group's income-generating ability.
Total revenue rose 35% last year to 18.44 billion kronor, while operating profit before provisions for loan losses rose 81% to 10.52 billion kronor from 5.81 billion kronor in 1992, it said.
The 1993 operating profit of 357 million kronor includes capital gains of 840 million kronor on the group's investment portfolio.
In the fourth quarter, the group had an operating profit before loan losses of 2.9 billion kronor, the best quarterly result during the past year.
