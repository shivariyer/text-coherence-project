The Securities and Exchange Commission barred a former stock trader for Fidelity Investments from the brokerage business.
Kenneth L. Anderson, of Brookline, Mass., pleaded guilty last year to 56 counts of securities fraud.
He was sentenced to five months in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $83,385 and a $14,000 fine.
Mr. Anderson could not be reached for comment.
According to federal authorities, Mr. Anderson asked market makers to accept fictitious trades he claimed to have made in a friend's account at prices that were more favorable than market prices.
When market makers received reports showing trades for which they had no record, Mr. Anderson persuaded them that they had made an error and should accept the trades.
He was fired after Fidelity discovered the scheme in October 1991.
Based on the guilty plea, the SEC barred Mr. Anderson from "association with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment adviser or investment company."
SEC officials said Mr. Anderson agreed to the ban, without admitting or denying the allegations.
