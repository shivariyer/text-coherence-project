Ipsco Inc. said it chose Muscatine County, Iowa, as the site for its proposed $360 million flat-rolled steel minimill.
The steelmaker, based in Regina, Saskatchewan, announced plans to build the mill last fall but hadn't chosen a location until now.
The mill would produce one million tons annually and employ 300 people.
Startup is scheduled for early 1996.
Ipsco said construction of the mill is conditioned on a number of approvals from the Iowa state government, including a change to the law to permit the company to own the land for the mill.
Ipsco, which also had considered a site in Kentucky, said it chose the Iowa location because of favorable transportation and energy costs, local tax levies and county and state support for infrastructure.
