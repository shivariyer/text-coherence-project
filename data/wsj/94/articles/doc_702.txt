Chemical Banking Corp. said it will close 50 branch offices and cut 650 consumer-banking jobs in the New York metropolitan area as part of the company's continuing "productivity efforts."
A Chemical spokesman said that 450 jobs would be cut through layoffs, effective Tuesday, and 200 through attrition.
The closings will occur through the year.
Though he declined to give figures, the spokesman said the savings and costs associated with the cuts will be reflected in the company's first-quarter results.
The move is part of the cost-control efforts made after Chemical's acquisition of Manufacturers Trust Corp. in 1991.
The spokesman said the cuts were also in part "customer-driven," because more customers are banking with ATM machines and through the company's new phone services.
