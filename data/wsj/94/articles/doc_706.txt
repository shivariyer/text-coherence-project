Health Care REIT Inc. said it signed an agreement to purchase a $10 million participation in an $86 million first mortgage loan for a medical facility under construction in Austin, Texas.
The loan was originated by National Health Investors Inc. of Murfreesboro, Tenn.
Health Care REIT has funded about $3.6 million of its $10 million commitment to NHI and will fund the balance through existing credit lines over the remainder of the construction period, which is scheduled to end in June 1995.
Health Care REIT, a real estate investment trust based in Toledo, Ohio, had net income of $20.1 million, or $2.15 a share, in 1993.
