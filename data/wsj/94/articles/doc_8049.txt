Brooklyn Union Gas Co. said its Gas Energy Inc. unit formed a new marketing partnership to enter the electric-power trading business.
The gas utility said the partnership, called PowerNet, will seek approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to market and broker power and make wholesale transactions.
Gas Energy said the new wholesale electricity marketing effort could include excess power available from its existing gas-fired cogeneration units.
The partnership includes several individuals who worked with Brooklyn Union Gas when it began marketing and trading natural gas during the past decade.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Brooklyn Union shares closed at $27.375, down 12.5 cents.
