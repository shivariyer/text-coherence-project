Metall Mining Corp. said it withdrew its bid for all the common shares of International Musto Explorations Ltd.
Musto, a Vancouver, British Columbia, mineral exploration company that owns a large copper-and-gold deposit in Argentina, said last week that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell a 50% interest in the project to M.I.M. Holdings Ltd. of Australia.
Metall, a Toronto mining concern, said its bid was subject to Musto not selling a significant stake in the project.
