Two Texaco Inc. employees filed a lawsuit on behalf of about 1,500 employees alleging the company discriminates against its African-American workers.
The complaint, filed last week in the U.S. District Court in White Plains, N.Y., where Texaco is based, seeks class-action status and alleges the company employs fewer black workers in certain salary ranges than the oil industry does.
The complaint also says Texaco hasn't allowed those workers the experience and opportunity needed for promotion and has retaliated against those who have objected to the alleged practices.
Texaco spokesman David Dickson said the complaint is "riddled with falsehoods," and the company believes it "would prevail" in court.
Mr. Dickson said about 2,100 of Texaco's U.S. employees are black, an increase of 15% in the past five years, during which the number of U.S. employees dropped to 20,000 from about 25,000.
Daniel L. Berger, an attorney representing the employees, said, "We believe the allegations are well-founded."
