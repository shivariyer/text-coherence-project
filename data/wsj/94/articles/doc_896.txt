Domestic and international political worries conspired to batter both the stock and bond markets.
The dollar fell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 48.37 points to 3821.09.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.19 to 464.35, and the Nasdaq Composite Index sank 10.83 to 786.68.
Analysts said uncertainty -- the bane of the financial markets -- was king yesterday.
It swept in from nearly every corner: Investors warily awaited President Clinton's planned news conference last night at which the Whitewater issue was expected to take center stage.
On top of that, financial markets shuddered in the wake of political uncertainty in Mexico following the assassination of the ruling party's candidate in coming presidential elections.
Growing tensions on the Korean peninsula further burdened investors.
Add a sharp rise in gold prices -- $4.60 an ounce to $391.60 for April delivery -- and all the ingredients were present for financial market distress.
With bond market investors already jittery from the recent rise in interest rates, the flood of uncertainties further undermined confidence, analysts said.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly 3/4 point, or nearly $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount, with the yield rising to 6.95% from 6.89% Wednesday.
"It's just an emotional reaction right now," said Donald Maude, chief U.S. fixed-income strategist at Scotia McLeod (USA).
Some bond investors swooped in to buy what they believe are undervalued long bonds.
Robert M. Balentine Jr., president of investment advisory firm Balentine & Co., said he found particular value in bonds with 20-year maturities.
"Ever since the Federal Reserve raised rates seven weeks ago, the long end has overreacted," said Mr. Balentine.
"By summer, we'll see long rates back down again because inflation is not much of a problem either in the U.S. or abroad."
Not so, said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, who contended that the bond market is responding to fears of a stronger economy ahead and growing inflationary pressures.
He cited a recent rise to a 3 1/2-year high in the Knight Ridder Commodity Research Bureau index of the 21 most widely followed commodities.
"This is the beginning of a further move up in commodity prices," Mr. Shulman said.
Bond market woes helped clobber stock prices.
By late morning, the industrial average had fallen 50 points, setting off the New York Stock Exchange "collar," which slows computer-aided program trading whenever the average moves up or down 50 points from the previous day's close.
The industrials hovered around that level for the rest of the day.
The turmoil in Mexico jolted the American depositary receipts of Mexican companies.
And among U.S. companies, economically sensitive stocks took a beating.
The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Stock index slumped 1%.
"Economically sensitive stocks are likely to be more negatively affected by a change in the political scene south of the border," said Thomas McManus, a U.S. market strategist at Morgan Stanley.
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index lost 0.02 to 114.93.
Stock prices tumbled.
Volume totaled 303.7 million shares on the Big Board, where 1,739 issues fell and 520 rose.
Bond prices sank.
The Treasury's 10year bond lost 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.551%.
The dollar fell.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.6655 marks and 104.55 yen compared with 1.6802 marks and 106.25 yen Wednesday.
