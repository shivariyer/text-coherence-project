The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a new formula for broker-dealers to calculate the size of charges they must take to offset the risk of their positions in listed options and related securities positions.
The agency described the proposal as "an important step in the commission's efforts to revamp the net capital rule to measure more accurately the risk in derivatives."
The proposal doesn't affect over-the-counter options, which are specially tailored transactions negotiated between two or more parties.
The SEC said it is still seeking a way to adequately measure the credit risk associated with OTC options and will study whether the new formula for listed options is applicable.
Under the proposal, the Options Clearing Corp. would figure the volatility of similar options and the theoretical gains and losses at 10 different points during the options' lifetimes.
Broker-dealers would plug that information, along with their options positions, into a computer spreadsheet that would generate a theoretical profit or loss for each of the 10 points.
The greatest potential loss would be taken as a charge, or "haircut," against net capital, the SEC suggests.
