Haggar Corp., benefiting from strong demand for its wrinkle-resistant all-cotton clothing, reported that its fiscal first-quarter profit soared eightfold while its sales jumped 34%.
The Dallas menswear maker's stock jumped on the results, as did shares of rival Farah Inc., an El Paso, Texas, apparel concern that also makes wrinkle-resistant clothing.
Haggar said net income in the period, which ended Dec. 31, was $4.5 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with $529,000, or eight cents a share, a year earlier.
The menswear concern said it shipped more than 2.1 million pairs of its wrinkle-resistant cotton pants in the latest quarter, up from 250,000 in the year-earlier period.
It predicted continued strong demand for the product in the rest of the fiscal year, as well as for two new wrinkle-resistant products, sport shirts and boy's pants.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Haggar climbed $4, or 14%, to $32.25.
Farah rose 87.5 cents, or 6.8%, to $13.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
