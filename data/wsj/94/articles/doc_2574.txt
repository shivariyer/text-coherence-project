Western German retail trading sales in January fell a real 2% from a year earlier, and stagnated in nominal terms, the Federation of German Retail Traders said.
Increased sales, however, were seen in the areas of two-wheeled vehicles and furniture, which both grew a nominal 13% in the year, music stores, where sales were up 8%, and housewares and hardware, up 7% each.
Compared with December, retail sales in January were down an average 37% as the end of Christmas shopping caused sales to drop across all sectors.
