"The recovery did not really get going until recently, and a lot of working people are only now starting to see some benefit. . . .
Clearly, it is premature at this point for the Fed to start slowing the economy."
-- SEN. PAUL SARBANES (D., Md.)
Sen. Sarbanes and like-minded others are criticizing the Fed's quarter-point rise in the Fed Funds rate as a response to unproven inflation fears.
We, too, want the strong economy to persist, but we're fairly certain that a Fed that tightens too late after the inflation goblins are loose will risk the return of the stagflation devil.
Rather than fearing that this quarter-point was premature, indeed, we fear it may be a bit late.
Given the unusual explicit announcement of the tightening, the Fed may share this fear.
A brisk monetary policy has offset the drag of the Clinton tax increases.
The economy was also boosted by a relaxation of a regulatory credit crunch and the success of Nafta.
This combination produced economic growth and renewed optimism.
But monetary stimulus cannot go on forever without stirring inflation, and after one good quarter the Fed feels a need to tighten.
We hope that Friday's sell-off is a temporary financial phenomenon, but if it turns out to presage a downturn in the real economy, the solution is not to beat on the Fed to print more money.
The solution will be to reverse the Clinton tax increases.
