Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. will set up an assembly facility and a shipping terminal for steel marine structures in Indonesia's Batam island near Singapore to meet growing regional demand for offshore resource-development equipment.
The project will be put into operation by the end of 1996, a company spokesman said.
He didn't disclose the size of the investment.
