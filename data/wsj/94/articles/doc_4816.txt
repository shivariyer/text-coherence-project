Chrysler Corp. said it will introduce two coupes based on the Mitsubishi Galant to replace the Dodge Daytona and the Chrysler LeBaron.
The two products, the Dodge Avenger, to be powered by a Chrysler-built four-cylinder engine, and the Chrysler Sebring, to be powered by a Mitsubishi-built six-cylinder, will be assembled at Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s Diamond-Star Motors facility in Illinois.
The Avenger will go into production first, in July.
Both products will be sold at the end of the year as 1995 models.
The Avenger and Sebring are designed to attract buyers who are older than Daytona drivers.
The cars are more rounded and look bigger, and will compete with Pontiac coupes and the Ford Thunderbird.
Under an agreement with Mitsubishi, Chrysler will market exclusively the coupes built off the Galant platform, and the Japanese company will market the four-door Galant.
The plant also produces the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Chrysler's Eagle Talon, identical cars which are being redesigned for the 1995 model year.
