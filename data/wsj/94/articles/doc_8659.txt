Rome prosecutors have questioned former Prime Minister Giuliano Amato in an investigation into Fiat SpA's 1987 acquisition of Alfa Romeo from Finmeccanica SpA, according to Italian news reports.
Prosecutors are looking into whether politicians may have unfairly favored the Fiat bid over Ford Motor Co.'s rival bid.
Former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, who was prime minister at the time of the Alfa Romeo sale, was also questioned by Rome magistrates last week, the news reports said.
Mr. Amato was a senior official in Mr. Craxi's government.
Representatives of one auto workers' union recently alleged that Ford's 1986 offer was more favorable, but that Fiat was chosen instead in a political deal.
Alfa Romeo is involved in labor negotiations over layoffs, and workers have taken to the streets in protest.
Mr. Amato reportedly told prosecutors that the Alfa Romeo bids weren't discussed by the cabinet.
According to reports, prosecutors have asked the court for permission to question Ford executives.
