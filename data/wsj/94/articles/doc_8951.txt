The earnings, compared with a year-earlier $66.1 million, represent a 1.26% return on total assets, a high level of profitability by industry standards.
The Portland, Ore., bank had year-end assets of $21.4 billion.
Per-share earnings for the quarter were 64 cents, up from a year-earlier 63 cents.
For 1993, the company earned $257.9 million, or $2.47 a share, up from the previous year's $148.2 million, or $1.45 a share.
