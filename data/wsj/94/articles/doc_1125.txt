April may be the cruelest month, but Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Co., hasn't fared well in March or February either.
Mr. Steinberg sent faxes to journalists, clients, and portfolio managers on the morning of Feb. 4 advising them that the Fed wouldn't raise interest rates that day.
Later that day, the Fed broke with tradition and announced that it would, in fact, raise rates.
Merrill Lynch rushed out a new fax headlined "Fed Tightens Policy!"
Yesterday, Mr. Steinberg was prepared.
He waited until after 11:30 a.m., when the Fed usually intervenes in the bond markets, and into the early afternoon before sending out a fax reading: "No Fed Tightening Today."
The Fed announced plans for another rate increase.
Merrill sent out another fax headlined -- you guessed it -- "Fed Tightens!"
"You're reminding me of something I want to forget," says Mr. Steinberg.
He won't say how many people received the two -- no, make that four -- faxes.
"People are going to wonder why we had such a large fax bill," he says.
Next time "we're going to wait until the Federal Open Market Committee meeting is finished," he says.
"The next time it won't be unexpected."
