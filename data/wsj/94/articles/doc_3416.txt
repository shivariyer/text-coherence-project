SmithKline Beecham PLC said it is selling seven of its small brands to Seton Healthcare Group PLC and that it is closing a factory in St. Helens in northwest England.
The St. Helens plant, which employs 480 full-time staff, will close at the end of this year.
SmithKline, a British maker of pharmaceutical and health-care products, said the sale of its brands and the plant closure reflects its intention to focus on large brands.
SmithKline refused to disclose the proceeds of the sale.
Seton, however, said it paid #3.25 million ($4.8 million) for the brands.
In 1993, the combined sales for the seven brands were #1.42 million and earnings totaled #768,000 before marketing and administrative costs.
The brands being sold include dietary supplements Phyllosan and Iron Jelloids, analgesic Fynnon Calcium Aspirin, the laxative Fynnon Salts, the rheumatic preparation Ellimans Embrocation and YeastVite and Dinnefords syrup for babies.
