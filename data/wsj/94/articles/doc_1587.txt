Figgie International Inc. posted a larger-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter and year and announced a sweeping restructuring plan to shed businesses accounting for about one-third of its 1993 sales of nearly $800 million.
The Willoughby, Ohio, manufacturing concern's loss for the quarter was $180.9 million, or $10.07 a share, compared with net income of $10.3 million, or 59 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
It also took pretax charges of $112 million in the quarter.
The charges consist of $77 million for an accounting change to cover an ill-fated factory automation project as well as $35 million for restructuring and consolidation of its facilities.
The company also said it "anticipates continued losses for a few quarters," as it attempts to turn itself around.
"I anticipate a marked improvement in profitability by late 1994 and particularly in 1995," Chairman Harry E. Figgie Jr. said in a statement, noting the company has made "good progress" on its plan to pay down debt by more than $200 million in 1994.
Figgie, which runs an eclectic array of businesses, said it will focus on its core industrial and technical business enterprises and will sell its American LaFrance fire truck parts and services unit; its Essick/Mayco pumps and mixers unit; its Safety Supply America safety products unit; its Sherwood-Drolet Corp. hockey equipment unit; and its Waite Hill Holdings insurance unit.
Earlier this year, it put on the block its Advance Security security guards division, and its Rawlings Sporting Goods group.
Altogether the units represent annual sales of $379 million; they will now report as discontinued operations.
The units contributed a loss of $8.5 million in the fourth quarter.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Figgie shares fell 87.5 cents apiece, or 8%, to $10.
For the full year, Figgie reported its first-ever annual loss, $179.8 million or $10.11 a share, including a $5.8 million gain from a change in accounting for income taxes.
That compared with net income of $28.3 million, or $1.61 a share, in 1992.
The company blamed its losses on weak industrial and commercial construction markets, flood damage in the Midwest, and extraordinary losses at its Fred Perry Sportswear and Hartman Electrical Manufacturing units.
FIGGIE INTERNATIONAL Inc. announced plans to shed businesses valued at $379 million, accounting for about one-third of its 1993 sales of $1.1 billion.
An article Friday incorrectly reported that those businesses represented one-third of Figgie's 1993 sales of $768 million.
Figgie had restated its 1993 sales to $768 million to reflect the planned divestitures.
