Texas-New Mexico Power Co. said it filed an application to increase its rates by an average of 8.9%, or about $34.8 million.
The utility is the principal, wholly owned unit of TNP Enterprises Inc., Fort Worth, Texas.
The proposed rate increase must be approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the Texas cities the power company serves.
The proposed rate increase for residential customers averages 8.3%, the company said.
Texas-New Mexico Power said the request is needed primarily to recover its operating expenses and to earn a reasonable return on invested capital.
For the year ended Sept. 30, 1993, the company said its total earned return on common equity was 3.48%; it is requesting a 12.2% return.
The utility company expects a hearing on the merits of its request to begin this July, and rates could be in effect in October.
Texas-New Mexico Power serves 90 towns and cities in Texas and New Mexico.
