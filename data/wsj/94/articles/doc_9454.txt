Newpark Resources Inc. said it will take a $1.7 million one-time charge to 1993 fourth-quarter earnings to cover costs of shedding its marine repair operation in Houston.
The company will begin reporting those results as a discontinued operation as of the 1993 fourth quarter.
In the year-ago fourth quarter, the New Orleans-based company posted earnings of $1.5 million, or 16 cents a share.
Newpark also said it leased the operation to a unit of closely held SFA Industries Inc. of Houston, and granted that company an option to purchase the facility.
Newpark said it accepted a commitment for a $9 million sale and leaseback financing from Republic Financial Corp. of Denver for the assets of the repair business.
Newpark said it plans to use the money to reduce short-term bank borrowings and expand its core integrated services to the oil and natural gas industry.
Separately, Newpark said that a shareholder who acquired 700,000 shares in exchange for canceling $5.4 million in Newpark debts completed the sale of those shares Monday.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Newpark is an environmental management and oil field construction company with operations principally in Louisiana and Texas.
