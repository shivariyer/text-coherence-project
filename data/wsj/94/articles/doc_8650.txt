McKesson Corp. said net income climbed 14% to $31.7 million in its third quarter on an 8% sales gain buoyed by rapid growth of its managed prescriptioncare service.
The results for the fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, equivalent to 69 cents a share, compared with $27.8 million, or 60 cents a share, a year ago.
Sales were $3.25 billion, up 8% from $3.01 billion.
Analysts figured the San Francisco-based company, whose razor-thin profit margins are typical of a distribution concern, would do slightly better, earning 72 cents a share.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, McKesson shares closed at $54.875, down 87.5 cents.
The drug distributor and health-care services concern noted that revenue at its PCS Health Systems division, which provides prescription services for 45 million people, rose 67% in the quarter.
