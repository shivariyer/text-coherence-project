Mauna Loa Macadamia Partners LP said net for the fourth quarter slipped 5.6% after a higher deferred tax rate for the period.
Net was $1.12 million, or 10 cents a Class A unit, compared with $1.18 million, or 10 cents a Class A unit, a year earlier.
Revenue jumped 19.4% to $5.7 million, from $4.8 million.
In a press release, the macadamia grower warned that low levels of rain in November and December, followed by heavy rainfall in January and February, may "adversely affect" the 1994-95 harvest, which begins in July and ends the following June, the company said.
