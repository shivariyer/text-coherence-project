Pier 1 Imports Inc. said it expects earnings for fiscal 1994, which ends Feb. 26, to fall 10% to 15% below analysts' estimates of 70 cents to 72 cents a share.
The announcement was made after the market had closed.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pier 1 shares closed at $9.50, up 12.5 cents.
The import specialty retailer had reported record sales of $97.2 million for the five weeks ended Jan. 1, up 11.8% from a year earlier.
But Clark A. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer, said that severe weather conditions in January hurt sales at more than 60% of the company's 639 stores, with the problem continuing into February.
Sales for the four weeks ending Jan. 29 were essentially flat, at $41.2 million.
Mr. Johnson also noted that 20 stores in California were affected by the earthquake in Los Angeles.
Mr. Johnson said that Fort Worth, Texas-based Pier 1 expects to resume positive sales growth "after winter passes."
