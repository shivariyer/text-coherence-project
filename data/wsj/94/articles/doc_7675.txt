Occidental Petroleum Corp. reported net income of $57 million for the fourth quarter, reversing a $588 million loss a year earlier.
Both periods were strongly affected by one-time items.
Without various gains and charges, the latest period produced a slightly wider loss than a year earlier.
On a per-share basis, profit amounted to 15 cents, while the year-earlier loss equaled $1.94.
Sales fell 13% to $2.02 billion from $2.32 billion.
Occidental stock fell 50 cents, to $18.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Ray R. Irani, chairman, president and chief executive officer of the petroleum, gas transmission and chemical company, said that cost-cutting efforts continue at the once-far-larger company but were outweighed by lower oil and chemical prices.
The loss in the 1992 fourth quarter reflects a charge of $600 million, or $1.99 a share, related to Occidental's decision to leave the coal business.
Occidental's historical core in oil and gas operations produced divisional profit of $76 million against $5 million a year earlier.
However, the latest period's figure includes an $85 million one-time gain from the reversal of tax reserves, indicating about a $9 million loss on operations.
The year-ago result reflects one-time charges totaling $58 million, indicating a $63 million profit from operations.
Natural-gas transmission had a 47% drop in division profit, to $74 million from $140 million a year earlier.
The year-earlier period had net gains of $64 million from one-time items, indicating operating profit of $76 million in the period.
Chemicals had a divisional profit of $16 million, more than double the $6 million of a year earlier.
The latest period, however, includes $6 million in gains from a one-time reversal of reserves for plant closing.
Major losses apparently were averted in the division by considerable reductions in operating costs.
In general corporate expenses, interest expense narrowed to $145 million from $158 million, the result of lower interest rates, the company said.
For the year, Occidental reported net income of $283 million, or 80 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $591 million, or $1.97 a share.
Revenue in slid 4.6% to $8.12 billion from $8.49 billion.
