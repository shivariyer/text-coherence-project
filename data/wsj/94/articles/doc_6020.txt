Sears, Roebuck & Co. reported a turnaround for the fourth quarter from a year-earlier loss, but its profit fell short of some analysts' expectations because of price cutting and higher advertising expenses during the Christmas shopping period.
The U.S.'s third-largest retailer said net income was $544.6 million, or $1.39 a share, swinging from the year-earlier net loss of $1.8 billion, or $4.84 a share.
The 1992 results included charges of $2.42 billion to account for restructuring, post-retirement benefits and Hurricane Andrew costs and a gain of $105.1 million from discontinued operations.
Excluding those items, Sears had profit of $504 million in the 1992 fourth period.
Analysts have been treated to a constant stream of good news from the big retail and insurance concern over the past year and were expecting slightly higher fourth-quarter profit.
In all but the fourth quarter of 1993, Sears's earnings significantly bested analysts' forecasts.
The report of earnings below forecasts sent Sears shares down $3.25, or 6.4%, to $47.75 in heavy composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
But some analysts weren't disturbed by the results.
"I didn't see anything in Sears's earnings report that was too terrible," said Karen Sack of Standard & Poor's Corp.
She had been expecting fourth-quarter earnings of $1.42 a share, three cents higher than the figure Sears reported.
"They still did well," she said.
For all of 1993, Sears reported record net income of $2.37 billion, or $6.13 a share, compared with a net loss in 1992 of $3.93 billion, or $10.72 a share.
Those results included gains in 1993 of $635 million from its Allstate Corp.'s initial public offering, and $76.1 million from tax accounting changes, and 1992 charges against earnings totaling $5.48 billion.
Revenue fell 2.9% to $50.84 billion from $52.34 billion.
"We're absolutely thrilled with the year," said Sears Chairman Edward A. Brennan.
"We're very pleased with the fourth quarter."
Mr. Brennan said the company's strong annual performance resulted from the company's repositioning program and from record earnings at its Allstate insurance subsidiary.
Sears's Allstate insurance unit reported fourth-quarter net income of $259 million, or 57 cents a share, compared with a loss of $139 million, or 32 cents a share on a pro-forma basis.
Allstate became a publicly traded company in June, when Sears sold 20% of Allstate to the public.
Sears, therefore, included $208 million of Allstate's fourth-quarter profit as its own.
For the year, Allstate reported record net income of $1.30 billion, or $2.99 a share, compared with a prior year loss of $825 million, or $1.91 a share.
Allstate officials attributed the results to expense reduction and the benefits of a recapitalization.
Sears's merchandise group, which consists of the store and credit-card operations, earned $310.3 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $1.46 billion a year earlier, which included a $1.66 billion restructuring charge.
Sears succeeded in cutting costs in its merchandise unit, as its selling and administrative expenses declined to 25% of sales in the quarter, from 26.3% of sales a year earlier.
Revenue for the division climbed 11%, to $9.29 billion.
While the price-cutting and promotional costs might have been higher than expected, they are likely to help the company in the future, as Sears moves to strengthen apparel sales, analysts say.
"Sears business continues to be strong.
They continue to get gains in apparel, and they continue to take costs out of their operations," said Peter Schaeffer, an analyst with Lynch, Jones & Ryan Inc.
"But at the same time they are building a new business, and that's expensive."
Mr. Brennan said he expects the company to continue to perform well this year.
"We established significant momentum in 1993 and are focusing our efforts to continue it in 1994," he said.
