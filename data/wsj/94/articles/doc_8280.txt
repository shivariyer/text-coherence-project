Crossborder transactions, mainly acquisitions and joint ventures, reached a record $152 billion last year, climbing by almost 20% from 1992 and three times from 1990 levels, according to KPMG Peat Marwick.
The accounting and consulting firm also found that the U.S., for the second year in a row, invested more money abroad than foreign businesses invested here.
In 1992, American firms sent $40 billion overseas, significantly more than the $34 billion moving the opposite way.
"This is a sea change," said Stephen Blum, KPMG's natonal director of corporate finance.
"For so many years our country was more of a target for deal-doers.
Now, with our advanced economic recovery, our strong stock markets and strengthening debt markets, and a relatively strong dollar, firms here are better positioned to reach abroad than they have been for years."
The study concludes that more crossborder investments are being made through joint ventures and minority investments than through mergers and acquisitions.
"This underscores the dominance of strategic players, in contrast to the financially oriented purchasers of the late 1980s," Mr. Blum asserted.
Foreign investors found U.S. electrical and electronics firms particularly attractive; other U.S. industries attracting foreign capital in 1993 included oil and gas, and chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
Capital flows are constantly changing course, and the study confirmed a number of trends.
Japanese crossborder investments were just $4 billion last year, down from an average $11 billion in 1991 and 1992.
China and Russia have also become favored capital destinations, capturing $22 billion last year, about six times more than they did in 1991.
But while some things change, others stay the time: The U.S. and Britain are, as they almost always have been, the world's favorite investment targets.
The two nations were also major capital sources last year, accounting for $68 billion in outbound investments, 45% of the world-wide total.
