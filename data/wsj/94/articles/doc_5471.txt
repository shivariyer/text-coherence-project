Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. and Immune Response Corp., partners in a joint venture to develop a vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus infection, said they resorted to arbitration to resolve a dispute about the venture's management.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, a unit of the French pharmaceutical company Rhone-Poulenc SA, initiated the arbitration Feb. 8 with a filing before the American Arbitration Association in St. Louis.
Immune Response, based in Carlsbad, Calif., filed its own demand for arbitration the next day.
Both companies were quick to say they don't expect the dispute to slow development of the AIDS-virus vaccine.
Dr. Dennis Carlo, chief operating officer of Immune Response, said the dispute focuses on which company will control the clinical trials and regulatory reviews required for the drug's eventual approval.
Rhone-Poulenc spokesman Bob Pearson contends that under a 1992 agreement, the 50-50 joint venture, Immunization Products Ltd., has control of all aspects of the drug's development, including clinical development, regulatory affairs, marketing and manufacturing.
As of the end of 1993, both companies had contributed half of a total $50 million to the joint venture.
Both companies emphasized they remain enthusiastic about the vaccine's prospects.
Made by Immune Response, it takes the whole AIDS virus, killing it with a chemical and radiation, and peeling off its outer protein coat.
It was designed by polio-vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk to treat people who already have the HIV virus.
