AlliedSignal Inc. and BASF Corp. said they ended talks on a joint venture of their textile and carpet fiber businesses.
Although each of their fiber businesses were "well positioned," the companies said they "could not reach a final agreement on a mutually satisfactory way to integrate them in a joint venture."
When the talks were announced last October, the companies said a combination would have more than $1 billion in revenue.
AlliedSignal, of Morris Township, N.J., also said the joint venture would have increased its 1995 earnings by five cents to 10 cents a share.
Parsippany, N.J.-based BASF is the North American member of the BASF Group of Germany.
