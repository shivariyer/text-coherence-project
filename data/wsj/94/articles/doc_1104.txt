South Korea's second-largest auto maker, Kia Motors Corp., said it will form a joint venture in Indonesia in partnership with Indonesia's Indauda Co., a subsidiary of Udatin Group.
The planned venture will assemble Kia's compact Pride passenger car with parts and components provided by Kia's plants in South Korea, Kia officials said.
The joint venture, to be called Indauda Putra Nasional Motors Co., will be capitalized at $100 million, funded 30% by Kia and 70% by the Indonesian partner.
