LaTex Resources Inc. said it completed the acquisition of $2 million in energy properties, mostly natural gas, from a seller that wasn't identified.
The company said the acquisition of producing properties will increase its domestic reserves by about 15% and add nearly $1 million a year to cash flow.
Some of the properties are in the Gulf Coast areas of the U.S.
