Brown Group Inc. reported a loss of $53.4 million, or $3.07 a share, for its fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting what it said was the end of a lengthy restructuring program.
Sales rose 6.4%, to $381.9 million.
For the full year, ended Jan. 29, Brown reported a loss of $31.6 million, or $1.83 a share, compared with profit of $4.6 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter charges of $29.5 million resulted from the closings of five shoe factories and more than 100 company-owned Connie and Regal specialty stores, and from related personnel and inventory expenses.
The company also took a fourth-quarter charge of $24.4 million for disposal of its leased shoe-department business.
After a decade in which the St. Louis company closed more than 2,400 retail stores and leased-department operations and 24 factories, Brown said its "extended restructuring is essentially completed."
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Brown closed at $35 a share, up 25 cents.
