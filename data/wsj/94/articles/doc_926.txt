U.S. steel imports in January increased 20.5% from December and 44.6% from January 1993.
January imports totaled 2,219,602 tons, compared with 1,841,557 tons in December and 1,535,147 tons a year earlier, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute's compilation of Commerce Department statistics.
However, the Washington-based American Institute for International Steel Inc. noted that purchases of semifinished steel by U.S. mills made up much of the increase.
"January imports of semifinished steel increased an astonishing 245% over 169,600 tons of these imports a year earlier, but finished-steel imports increased only 19.8% to 1.6 million tons from 1.4 million tons in January 1993," the institute said in a news release.
"The share of semifinished steel in total steel imports rose to 26.3% in January from 11% a year ago.
One out of four tons of total import volume is now brought in by U.S. steel mills themselves," the release added.
January imports represented 24.7% of consumption, up from 20.6% in December 1993 and up from 18.8% in January 1993, the institute's release said.
U.S. steel exports in January totaled 277,060 tons, down 3.7% from December's exports of 287,712 tons and down 21.8% from 354,320 tons a year earlier.
