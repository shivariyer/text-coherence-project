Gateway Casino Co., a partnership controlled by Caesars World Inc., Las Vegas, and Casino Magic Corp., was named the preferred developer for a dockside casino complex at Laclede's Landing in St. Louis.
The $210 million complex, Caesars Magic Casino, will feature a replica riverboat casino, hotel and parking facilities.
Gateway Casino's proposal offered St. Louis 9% of gambling revenues initially -- and as much as 11% of future revenues -- plus a share of casino profits.
The selection of the partnership was made by a St. Louis city committee.
Casino Magic is based in Bay St. Louis, Miss.
