Dow Jones & Co. said it adopted a new pricing structure for its Dow Jones News/Retrieval service in the U.S., based on the amount of information received.
Effective March 1, customers will pay $1.50 per 1,000 characters of information, including letters, spaces and punctuation marks, regardless of the time of day or network speed.
The rate previously was $1.14 per 1,000 characters.
Charges for time spent on line, which had ranged from 80 cents to $1.95 a minute, will be eliminated.
All customers pay a one-time start-up fee of $29.95 and an annual $19.95 service fee.
Dow Jones News/Retrieval provides a wide variety of on-line business and financial news and information, including the full text of The Wall Street Journal.
The service is published by Dow Jones Business Information Services, a part of the Information Services group of Dow Jones.
Dow Jones also publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine and community newspapers.
