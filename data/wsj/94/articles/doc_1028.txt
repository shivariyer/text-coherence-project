Tyco International Ltd. launched a $19-a-share tender offer valued at $95.6 million for Mark Controls Corp., topping Danaher Corp.'s $17.75-a-share bid valued at $89.3 million extended last week.
Prior to Tyco's proposal, Mark Controls, a Skokie, Ill., industrial-valve maker, said its directors advised shareholders to accept Danaher's offer, noting failure to recommend the purchase could jeopardize its agreement with Danaher and allow the Washington-based auto-parts maker to terminate its pact.
Mark Controls earlier said it might be interested in a bid from a suitor other than Danaher after Tyco, through an informal overture, indicated it was prepared to pay $19 a share for the company.
Mark Controls made what it characterized as a "counterproposal" to Tyco, suggesting Tyco make a tender offer directly to holders, without first entering an agreement with Mark Controls, which might breach the Danaher pact.
Prior to its formal offer, Mark Controls said if Tyco, an Exeter, N.H., equipment maker, made a bid of $19 a share or higher by April 4, Mark Controls wouldn't trigger its antitakeover, poison-pill provisions.
Mark Controls' shares closed unchanged at $19.25 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
