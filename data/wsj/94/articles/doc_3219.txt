William Soady was named president and chief executive officer, filling two top positions that had been vacant since last May.
Mr. Soady, 50 years old, had been president of domestic distribution for TriStar Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp.
He succeeds Roy H. Aaron, 64, who resigned last year.
In the interim, Mr. Aaron's function had been filled by a four-member office of the chairman headed by William D. Eberle, Showscan's chairman.
