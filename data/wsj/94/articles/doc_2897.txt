Americans increased their debt loads in January, for the eighth month in a row.
Consumer credit in the first month of 1994 rose $6 billion from December, the Federal Reserve said, or at an annual rate of 9.1%.
The rate trailed December's 11.5%
Though growth in auto loans slowed to a 2.7% annual rate, revolving credit, which includes bank cards department-store charge accounts, strengthened to a 14.2% annual rate.
Gary Ciminero, economist for Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I., speculated that "either consumers are having trouble paying Christmas off or, on the positive, they aren't having trouble and are just deciding to take on more credit."
In any event, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told a banking meeting that the economy is doing well and will continue to do so for the "foreseeable future," adding that housing and auto sales are showing substantial growth.
This growth is a direct result of the consumer's taking on added credit, according to Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co., in Chicago.
"The consumer refuses to resign from the recovery.
If that means borrowing, so be it," said Mr. Dederick.
He also said January's consumer-credit numbers are a "classical recovery sign," which supports the current strength of the economy.
Figures have been adjusted for normal seasonal variations.
