A Northwest Airlines unit said it signed contracts with five Chinese airlines to train at least 250 of their pilots and more than 30 flight attendants in the U.S. this year.
John Watkins, Northwest's managing director for Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, said the participating carriers are China Southwest, China Eastern, China Northern, Shanghai Airlines and Xiamen Airlines.
All fly key domestic routes, and Shanghai-based Chinese Eastern also flies to the U.S. and to other overseas points.
The training, provided by Northwest Aerospace Training Corp. in St. Paul, Minn., includes refresher courses for qualified pilots, instruction on new aircraft types and training for air force pilots just starting out on civilian planes.
Northwest declined to specify the value of the contracts, which are renewable.
But Mr. Watkins said the first year of training "is a multimillion-dollar deal."
Such contracts could help China improve its poor aviation-safety record.
The industry is facing harsh criticism from international aviation watchdogs for failing to speedily tackle a pilot shortage and improve its poor aviation infrastructure.
