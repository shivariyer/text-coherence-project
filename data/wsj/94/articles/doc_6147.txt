MathSoft Inc., citing a changing product focus, said it plans to cut 25% of its work force, about 50 jobs, and take a $3 million third-quarter restructuring charge.
MathSoft said the restructuring may "temper revenue growth" until an earnings recovery takes hold.
The Cambridge, Mass., maker of calculation software and electronic books said it plans to eliminate programs and products that don't meet its "return objectives."
A spokesman for the company wasn't available immediately to elaborate.
MathSoft said it also will eliminate nonperforming marketing programs and consolidate facilities.
MathSoft, which said the charge is subject to change, reported net income of $551,000, or eight cents a share, on revenue of $7.7 million for the 1993 third quarter.
The results are pro forma.
