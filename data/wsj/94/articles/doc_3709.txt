Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which recently announced plans to divest itself of its PG&E Resources unit of Dallas, said it's considering taking the unit public.
PG&E, of San Francisco, filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of the unit under the proposed name Dalen Resources Corp.
The filing contemplates a sale of 22 million Dalen shares at a price of $20 each.
"A final decision on the offering hasn't been made yet," said a PG&E spokesman.
He didn't rule out the possibility of a divestiture through a private sale.
The operations to be sold had revenue of $231.5 million last year, about 2% of PG&E's total 1993 revenue.
The energy concern has said the unit "doesn't quite fit" with the parent's long-term strategy.
