"Mr. {Vincent} Foster's death was widely blamed on us . . .," you write in an editorial March 9.
"Michael Kinsley cast the first stone, as is his wont. . . .
We never viewed this theme as an accident."
You go on to cite a news article that "confirmed our suspicions" by reporting "unsolicited calls from the White House" urging this theme.
For the record, my column about The Wall Street Journal and Vincent Foster was not occasioned by any calls from the White House, solicited or unsolicited.
I had no discussion about it (before it appeared) with anyone in the White House or otherwise Clinton-connected.
Also for the record, the column specifically said -- twice -- that the Journal should not be blamed for Foster's suicide.
My point was that the Journal's editorials about Foster and the Rose Law Firm were shoddy and dishonest.
Your March 9 editorial confirms my suspicions.
