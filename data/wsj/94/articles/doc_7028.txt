President Clinton nominated Boston lawyer Deval Patrick as assistant attorney general for civil rights.
The post for chief civil-rights enforcer has been empty since Mr. Clinton took office.
Mr. Patrick, 37 years old, is a partner in the firm of Hill & Barlow, where he has a civil and corporate practice.
He also is involved in a number of pro-bono civilrights cases.
Mr. Patrick grew up in a poor black neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, where his family received welfare for a time.
He attended Milton Academy preparatory school in Massachusetts, Harvard College and Harvard Law School.
He spent a year working and traveling in the Sudan and Nigeria, and was a staff lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
Mr. Patrick is the third person put forward for the job.
The nomination of Lani Guinier, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, was withdrawn because of controversy surrounding her writings, and John Payton, District of Columbia corporation counsel, withdrew his name after he didn't get support from members of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Mr. Patrick's nomination quickly drew fire from the conservative leader who led the attack against Ms. Guinier.
Clint Bolick, vice president of the Institute of Justice, said Mr. Patrick favors racial quotas, an affirmative-action tool Mr. Patrick specifically has said he opposes.
Mr. Clinton, in announcing the nomination, struck back at Mr. Patrick's opponents, saying, "They don't give a rip about civil rights."
Words of praise also came quickly.
Rep. John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat who is dean of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Mr. Patrick's "combination of credentials and life experience will be a boon to the department."
