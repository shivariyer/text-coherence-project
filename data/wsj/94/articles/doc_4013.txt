Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it upgraded the insurance financial-strength ratings of the six members of Home Insurance Group's property/casualty inter-company pool to single-Baa1 from single-Baa2.
The ratings have been on review for possible upgrade since November when the group's holding company, Home Holdings Inc., said it planned to recapitalize and reduce leverage.
Moody's said the rating upgrades reflect, among other things, the successful completion of the recapitalization, a strengthened loss-reserve position and continued support from Home's ultimate parent company, Sweden-based Trygg-Hansa SPP Holding AB.
