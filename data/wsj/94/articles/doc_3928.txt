Year-on-year inflation in the European Union picked up to a provisional 3.4% in January from 3.3% in December, the EU's statistics office said.
Inflation was down from 3.5% in January 1993.
Eurostat said seven EU states -- Ireland, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom -- now meet the condition in the Maastricht treaty on European union that countries wishing to move to a single European currency must have an inflation rate within 1.5 percentage points of the average of the three lowest rates.
That average was 1.8% in January.
Eurostat said four countries applying to join the EU -- Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway -- also met the criterion.
According to the Eurostat data, Germany, on the basis of western German inflation alone, doesn't yet meet the Maastricht treaty criterion.
Low inflation is just one of several criteria for a single currency set out in the Maastricht treaty.
The others are stable exchange rates, a low budget deficit and a debt-to-gross domestic product ratio of less than 60%.
