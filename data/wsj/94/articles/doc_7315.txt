Designs Inc. said it took a restructuring charge of $9 million in its fourth quarter ended Saturday to close as many as 10 of its stores and update others.
The operator of specialty retail stores said the outlets slated to close generated about 3% of the company's total sales volume in the year to date.
As a result of expense savings associated with the closings, the restructuring is expected to add about $2 million to pretax earnings in fiscal 1995.
