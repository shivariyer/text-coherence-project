C. Olivetti & Co., Milan, reached agreement with employee groups to cut 1,932 jobs in an effort to restructure the financially ailing company.
The computer and office-equipment maker's agreement with labor unions includes provisions for reduced working hours, wage cuts and professional training measures.
Olivetti has been moving away from increasingly unprofitable activities such as making computers to more profitable businesses like telecommunications.
An Olivetti-led consortium is seen as a leading candidate to win a second Italian license to operate a cellular telephone network.
