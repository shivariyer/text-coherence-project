Southwest Airlines will add four new cities to its route map next quarter, all in the western half of the nation, and plans to boost service on the East Coast later this year by adding gates in Baltimore.
In a meeting with Wall Street analysts in New York yesterday, Southwest Chairman Herbert D. Kelleher said the Dallas-based carrier will start flying to airports in Portland, Ore., Orange County, Calif., Seattle and Spokane, Wash., during the second quarter.
Each of those cities is currently served by Morris Air Corp., which Southwest bought last year.
Since the Morris purchase, completed Dec. 31, Southwest and Morris have been trying to combine their route structures.
In addition to taking over those four western cities from Morris, Southwest plans to stop Morris service to Palm Springs, Calif., and Eugene, Ore.
Other Morris cities could be eliminated.
Mr. Kelleher said that the success of Southwest's service to the East Coast since last September is prompting the carrier to seek additional gates at Baltimore/Washington Airport, which could heat up an already competitive fare war.
By year's end, Southwest will have eight gates, up from the current two.
