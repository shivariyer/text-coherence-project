The columns below show, by industries, earnings reported for the fourth quarter of 1993 and those for the like quarter of 1992, with percentage changes.
Where individual company reports cover three month periods other than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods have been used.
For all dollar figures, 000s have been omitted.
The table reflects the fact that many companies have closed down facilities, sold off assets or otherwise restructured operations.
The "net income" columns include both income from operations and the gains or losses associated with such moves.
The "net on continuing operations" columns, insofar as possible, exclude such gains and losses.
In cases in which the after-tax gains or losses haven't been reported, they are retained in "net on continuing operations."
The intent is to show how each industry would have fared if its companies throughout the quarter had been structured as they were at the end of the period.
