A high-profile joint venture to make a new breed of computer displays is running into delays, causing problems for In Focus Systems Inc., Tualatin, Ore.
The company, a 50-50 partner with Motorola Inc. in the display venture called Motif, disclosed that the venture will not begin volume production of the new displays until the first quarter of 1995.
Production had been expected in the third quarter this year, said John Harker, In Focus's chief executive officer.
Also, more money will be needed to develop a new low-end display designed for hand-held game devices and other applications, In Focus said.
As a result, In Focus will have to put up $1.5 million to $3.5 million to cover its share of Motif's operating expenses in the third and fourth quarters of 1994, reducing In Focus's potential profits for the year by as much as $3.5 million, or about 30 cents a share, Mr. Harker said.
Analysts had expected the company to earn between $8 million and $9 million for the year, or 70 cents to 80 cents a share, on sales of as much as $95 million, he said.
