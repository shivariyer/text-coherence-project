Canadian Transport Minister Douglas Young said he intends to designate Air Canada to serve the new Kansai airport in Osaka, giving the Montreal carrier long-sought access to the Japanese market.
Canadian Airlines International, a unit of PWA Corp., has been the only Canadian carrier serving Japan; the Calgary, Alberta airline called the government's decision "extremely disappointing."
The announcement in Ottawa came a day after Air Canada said it would drop litigation that has blocked financially troubled Canadian Airlines from concluding a proposed alliance with AMR Corp., the Fort Worth, Texas, parent of American Airlines.
Industry observers speculate that Air Canada abandoned the legal fight in return for access to Japan, though Mr. Young on Wednesday denied such a link.
