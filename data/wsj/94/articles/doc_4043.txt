Tops Appliance City Inc., Edison, N.J., said fiscal fourth-quarter net income plunged 39%, partly because of disappointing holiday sales and lower profit resulting from increased competition.
The appliance and consumer-electronics retailer said net income fell to $2.4 million, or 34 cents a share, from a year-earlier pro forma $3.9 million, or 55 cents a share.
Sales and service revenue rose to $132.6 million from $115.7 million.
The company went public last August at $14 a share.
Philip M. Schmidt, president and chief operating officer, said sales in new stores resulted in an increase in sales for the fourth quarter of 30%, but sales in stores open more than a year fell 17%, in part because of the transfer of sales to a new store in Union, N.J., and a change in the end of the fiscal year to Dec. 28 from Dec. 31.
Full-year earnings fell 33% to $4.7 million, or 65 cents a share, from $6.9 million or 97 cents a share.
Sales and service revenue rose 20% to $411.4 million from $344 million.
