The National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. said it took disciplinary actions against a number of firms and individuals for violations of securities laws and rules.
Princeton American Equities Corp., Phoenix, was fined $45,000, jointly and severally with two individuals -- each responsible for the full amount.
The firm also was required to pay $42,447 in restitution to customers, jointly and severally with an individual, and was expelled from NASD membership.
The Washington, D.C.-based association said Princeton American failed to meet minimum required net capital and failed to maintain accurate books and records, and it also made trades with public customers at unreasonable markups.
David Smith, secretary/treasurer of Princeton Electronic Products Inc., the parent of Princeton American Equities, said the unit was closed 30 to 45 days ago.
"We think the fines are appropriate based on the fact that the personnel in that particular division were not conducting business properly," Mr. Smith said.
He said the NASD doesn't let the parent company supervise the operations of subsidiaries.
"There is no way in the world we could have straightened it out because we weren't allowed," Mr. Smith said.
He noted that Princeton American was a very small part of the assets of the parent and was never a signficant revenue producer.
Two firms were expelled and five individuals were barred and fined for a series of transactions.
Bachus & Stratton Securities Inc., Pompano Beach, Fla., and Wasatch Stock Trading Inc., Salt Lake City, were expelled.
Bachus and principal Salvator Anthony Lanza, Boca Raton, Fla., were fined $200,000 jointly and severally and ordered to disgorge $815,259.

The NASD said Bachus sold shares it had purchased directly or indirectly from another entity through principal transactons.
Mr. Lanza, it said, failed to disclose or cause brokers to disclose to customers that they were purchasing common stock from an entity controlled by Mr. Lanza, resulting in profit to Bachus of $276,678.
And the firms and individuals created the appearance of trading activity by manipulating the market for the stock, among other violations, the NASD said.
Unless otherwise noted, none of the firms or individuals could be reached for comment.
DWS Securities Corp., Sonora, Calif., principal Stephen Michael Rangel and principal Hugh Scott Liddle Jr., Modesto, Calif., were fined $394,550 jointly and severally and required to make written offers of rescission to investors.

It added that the company and two supervisory employees, Mr. Sherman and Mr. Coolidge, consented to the penalties to resolve the proceedings "in an expeditious manner and to continue business as normal."
