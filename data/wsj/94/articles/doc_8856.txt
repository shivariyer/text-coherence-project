Boise Cascade Corp., dogged by poor markets for paper products, reported a slightly narrowed fourth-quarter net loss of $23.7 million, or 98 cents a share.
The big forest-products concern's net loss for the period was less than last year's fourth-quarter loss of $29.6 million.
But the per-share loss in the latest quarter eclipsed last year's per-share loss of 97 cents because of increased preferred dividends in the latest period.
Sales in the quarter increased 10% to $997 million from $905 million.
The quarterly loss was toward the high end of analysts' estimates, which had ranged from 60 cents a share to $1.05 a share, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
Nonetheless, Boise Cascade's stock rose 75 cents to close at $26.75 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
For all of 1993, Boise Cascade's net loss narrowed to $77.1 million, or $3.17 a share, as improved building-products earnings partially offset continued heavy losses in paper products.
Last year, the company reported a net loss of $227.5 million, or $6.73 a share, including a $73 million charge reflecting an accounting change.
Sales for the full year rose 7% to $3.96 billion from $3.72 billion a year ago.
John B. Fery, chairman and chief executive, said he expects the company's building-products segment to perform well in 1994, mainly because of increased building activity and strong pricing.
But he said "very difficult" market conditions in the paper business could continue to crimp the company's overall results.
Paper prices have been depressed for years by oversupply and the slow economy.
