A shareholder filed suit against Greenwich Pharmaceuticals Inc., Fort Washington, Pa., claiming the company made misleading and fradulent statements about its arthritis drug.
The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Court of Chancery, names officers and directors of the company.
Last month, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel denied Greenwich approval to market the drug, called Therafectin, after finding it hasn't proven to be effective.
A Greenwich spokesman said the company hadn't seen the lawsuit and had no comment.
