Phillips Petroleum Co. said it revised its net income for the fourth quarter and year-end 1993 because of a lawsuit settlement that was more costly than the Bartlesville, Okla., company had forecast.
Phillips said its revised fourth quarter net income is $20 million, or eight cents a share; in January, the company had announced fourth quarter net income of $39 million, or 15 cents a share.
For full year 1993, revised net is $243 million, or 93 cents a share; originally, that figure had been $262 million, or $1 a share.
The revision is the result of an agreement to settle 15 claims stemming from an October 1989 fire and explosion that killed 23 workers.
The amount of the settlement, which Phillips wouldn't disclose, was higher than the company had set aside for contingent liabilities.
As a result, the company said it made an additional accrual to cover future liability exposure in the remaining unsettled cases, which number about 150.
