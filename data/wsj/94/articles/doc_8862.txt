A late wave of selling left the Dow Jones Industrial Average unchanged from Monday's record level.
Bond prices rose and the dollar fell.
The Dow Jones industrials finished at 3870.29.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.95 to 474.25, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.84 to a record 793.02.
Stock prices were buoyed by some upbeat earnings reports, notably Chrysler's better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit.
The news helped boost all three auto makers.
Several banks also reported positive earnings, but some bank stocks slumped as investors took profits on the good news.
"It tends to be a bad sign for a stock group when you get good earnings news and the stock prices move down," says Walter C. Revis, market analyst at Hamilton Investments in Chicago.
"It's sometimes a sign the group may be overbought."
Bond prices rose as commodities prices, including oil, fell.
But Mary Jane Matts, director of investment research at Society Asset Management in Cleveland, says the recent weakness in oil prices may be ending.
She argues oil prices may move up as much as $3 to about $17 a barrel by the end of the quarter.
"If that happens, it will precipitate a dramatic change in the way the financial markets feel about inflation," Ms. Matts said.
World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.40 to 113.43.
