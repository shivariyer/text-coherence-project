In case anyone is still interested in the Kanab ambersnail (Dec. 27 editorial and Jan. 13 letter), here's a story that might add some perspective.
My 96-year-old uncle, G.R. "Doc" Aiken, is a longtime resident of Kanab, Utah.
He served for many years as the town's only physician, and was also mayor and representative to the Utah legislature.
Last June, when I told him about the reports of the endangered ambersnail, he exclaimed, "My God, I hope those aren't the snails Nita and I took to the ponds!"
It seems that back in the late 1930s Doc's wife, Nita, ordered some waterlilies from China to decorate the pond behind the hospital.
When the lilies arrived, they were infested with dozens of small, yellowish snails.
Rather than kill them, Doc took them to some ponds north of town and released them, thinking nothing more about it.
Until last June.
Could it be that the "endangered" ambersnail is actually a foreign invader with lots of relatives back home?
