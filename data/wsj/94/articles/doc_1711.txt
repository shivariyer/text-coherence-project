Fisher Scientific Co. agreed to pay the government $1.7 million for its role in falsely certifying that scientific laboratory equipment shipped to Egypt had been made in the U.S.
The company, a Pittsburgh unit of Fisher Scientific International Inc., Hampton, N.H., pleaded guilty to a one-count misdemeanor charge, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Donna Gallucio in Newark, N.J.
Fisher Scientific had been selected to supply certain items under a grant aid program to the Egyptian government.
Various Fisher employees supplied certifications that falsely stated that the products were made in the U.S., when in fact, several items were not U.S.-made, the U.S. attorney's office said.
Fisher Scientific said it will pay $1.2 million in restitution to the U.S., as well as $500,000 for the costs of prosecution.
The company also faces a maximum fine of $200,000 when it is sentenced on May 26, the U.S. attorney's office said.
