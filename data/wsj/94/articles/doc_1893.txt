Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the debt rating of Cablevision Industries Corp., one of the largest U.S. cable operators, affecting about $500 million in long-term notes.
The service lowered the rating for senior notes due 2002 to B from Baa, and assigned a B rating to its senior debentures due 2008.
Moody's said the actions reflect its concerns about Cablevision Industries' high leverage and the company's vulnerability to rate regulation by the Federal Communications Commission.
Moody's said it is "concerned that Cablevision may not generate the levels of cash flow previously anticipated."
Rocco Commisso, Cablevision's chief financial officer, said that while Cablevision is concerned about the FCC action, he considers Moody's downgrade to be "inconsistent" with his company's financial performance.
He noted that Standard and Poor's Corp., another rating agency, upgraded the same debt to a double-B-minus from single-B-plus last fall and reaffirmed that rating earlier this month.
