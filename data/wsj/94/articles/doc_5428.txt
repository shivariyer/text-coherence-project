Your Jan. 18 article, "Expected `Big One' Hasn't Arrived Yet," about the Los Angeles earthquake, has an arithmetic flaw.
The article acknowledges the earthquake as being 6.6 on the Richter scale, which is a logarithmic scale to the base 10.
The 1992 earthquake in Southern California was, according to the article, only 7.5 magnitude.
While this is a respectable magnitude, it is only eight times larger, rather than the 30 times larger stated in the article.
By comparison, the 8.3 San Francisco 1906 earthquake was 50 times larger than the one we had here Jan. 17.
