Cosmetic Center Inc. said sales for the four weeks ended Jan. 21 slipped about 1.4% to $6.8 million from $6.9 million a year earlier, while sales for stores open at least a year fell about 10%.
The retailer of cosmetics, fragrances and beauty aids whose stores are concentrated in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic regions said severe winter weather hurt sales.
