Cooper Cos., mired in costly legal expenses, reported a narrower fourth-quarter loss, but said auditors questioned the company's ability to continue as a going concern.
The maker of medical products said its potential legal liabilities, as well as losses and negative cash flows for the last three fiscal years, raised concerns about its financial strength with outside auditors.
Cooper and its former co-chairman Gary Singer face possibly stiff fines and sentencing on March 25 for their convictions in an illegal junk-bond trading scheme.
The company also faces related civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and last fall settled lawsuits related to its former breast-implant business, which it sold in 1988 to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
Cooper said it may continue to face cash shortages.
Cooper reported a fourth-quarter loss of $11.5 million, or 38 cents a share, due partly to investment losses and legal expenses.
The latest quarter included a $2.1 million pretax charge for debt restructuring and a $1.5-million pretax charge for the settlement of various lawsuits.
In the year-earlier quarter, Cooper reported a net loss of $17 million, or 56 cents a share, including a $7 million charge to reserve funds for breast-implant litigation and a small gain on the purchase of subordinated debt.
Revenue for the quarter edged up 1% to $22.1 million from $21.9 million.
For the year, the company said its loss widened to $46.8 million, or $1.55 a share, from $24.8 million, or 96 cents a share, in 1992.
The 1993 results include a charge of $13.7 million, largely for reserves for breast-implant legal expenses.
The 1992 results included a charge of $9.3 million, largely for legal expenses.
Revenue for the year climbed 46% to $92.7 million.
The stock closed at 56.25 cents a share, up 6.25 cents, or 12.5%, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
