Canada's new Liberal Party government, which took office in November, said that on Feb. 22 it will introduce its first budget.
The budget will include spending and revenue projections for the fiscal year starting April 1.
The government said the budget may also include tax changes that would take effect immediately, subject to eventual approval by Parliament.
