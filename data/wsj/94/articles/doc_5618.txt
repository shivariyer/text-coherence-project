Tim Ferguson's Jan. 11 Business World "The Clogged Pipeline of Craft Training" does a good job of perpetuating the myth that the building trades are minimally skilled laborers.
It does not leave the reader with the impression that these men and women undergo rigorous educational programs, supervision and testing, as do those in other professions.
Nor does it illustrate the technical competencies, planning, decision-making and risk associated with most trades.
Perspective might be gained by changing the profession in Mr. Ferguson's article to CPA, attorney, physician, nurse or college professor.
Or perhaps Mr. Ferguson would consider the advantage to the economy of lower-priced newspapers and magazines if only editorial writers were paid 25% to 30% less than they are currently making.
Seriously, many people sleep more soundly and business people are freed to focus on profit-making ventures because tradespeople provide quality work.
These people are the backbone of society and they are entitled to an adequate compensation.
The arrogance of Mr. Ferguson's article is appalling.
