The Teamsters Union said it has been asked to help in an organizing drive aimed at gaining union representation for some 20,000 employees of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said a committee of noncontract employees of United, ranging from reservations agents to engineers, want the union to help them negotiate terms of a proposed employee buyout.
Late last year, United's pilots and machinist unions agreed to buy a majority stake in the company in a transaction valued at about $5 billion.
In exchange for wage and work-rule concessions, the labor groups, along with United's thousands of noncontract workers, would receive equity in the company, and create a new shortflight operation.
Some noncontract employees have complained because they felt they had virtually no say in the buyout.
But it isn't clear how much impact those employees, even with union representation, could have on the majority-stake purchase at this advanced stage of the transaction.
