Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, said it prepaid all of its remaining $1.8 billion of debt outstanding to the Federal Financing Bank.
The company, which provides financing for student loans and college facilities and equipment, said it was taking advantage of low interest rates and narrow credit spreads.
Student Loan Marketing last borrowed from the Federal Financing Bank in 1982.
