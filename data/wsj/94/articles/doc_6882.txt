America West Airlines said it extended a fare sale that offers discounts of as much as a third off its leisure-class tickets.
The airline said tickets must be purchased by Feb. 22 for travel by May 15, and require 14-day advance purchase and a Saturday night stay.
Phoenix-based America West has offered these lower fares off and on for the past year, a spokeswoman said, "and they've been very successful for us."
Other airlines are likely to match the lower ticket prices in markets where they compete head-to-head with America West.
