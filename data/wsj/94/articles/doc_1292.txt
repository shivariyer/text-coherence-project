A Food and Drug Administration panel recommended approval of the use of excimer laser systems made by Summit Technology Inc. and VISX Inc., to treat diseased corneas, provided the companies submit additional data on patients one year after treatment.
But stock of VISX tumbled $4.75, or 18.1%, to close at $21.50, and stock of Summit fell $4, or 11.7%, to close at $30.25, both in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Data on the systems, used to remove corneal scars, dystrophies and recurrent erosions, will be analyzed for safety and stability of treatment before the FDA issues a final decision, company officials said.
The FDA has yet to consider Summit's application to use the same equipment to treat nearsightedness, and VISX's application to use it to treat nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism.
Summit Technology, based in Waltham, said the panel's recommendation was "a major step forward in our regulatory march."
The excimer laser is Summit's principal product, which has been in development since 1986.
VISX, in Santa Clara, Calif., said FDA approval of the process would enable it to sell its first product in the U.S.
The news is "a major step forward, and it establishes a new market for the company," said Jim Williams, chief financial officer.
Peter Litman, Summit's general counsel, said the system could make unnecessary some of the 40,000 corneal transplants done annually in the U.S.
The excimer laser sculpts the cornea and removes diseased tissue.
The Summit systems sell for $400,000 to $450,000 apiece.
Summit said it will submit the requested data to the FDA within a month.
VISX's chief financial officer, Jim Williams, could not say why his company's stock tumbled.
"There's nothing from the company's perspective that would have given the feeling of anything but confidence," he said.
He speculated that investors were reacting to wire reports that ran before the panel voted, saying that the tone of the panel's meeting was negative.
