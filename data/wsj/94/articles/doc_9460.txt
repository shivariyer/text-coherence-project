The Clinton administration is considering a plan that would automatically declassify government secrets within 40 years.
The plan being debated in the National Security Council, would greatly revamp the classification system in place since the Reagan administration.
It would require government officials to keep information unclassified, for instance, if they determine that the public interest requires it.
No such "balancing" test currently is required.
The Federation of American Scientists, a liberal advocacy group that obtained and released copies of the plan, said the proposal doesn't go far enough.
The group said government secrets should be declassified within 20 years.
The version of the plan released by the federation is dated Nov. 10.
Clinton administration officials said the proposal has been changed since then.
