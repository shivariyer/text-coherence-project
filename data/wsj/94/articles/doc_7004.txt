Mapco Inc. said there was an explosion and fire at its pipeline station near Iowa City, Iowa, but the company didn't immediately know the extent of any damage.
No one was injured in the blast, which occured shortly after 9 a.m. EST yesterday, according to company spokesman Rick Neal.
An Associated Press report said witnesses heard five explosions and saw flames shooting 100 feet into the air.
Mapco's Mr. Neal said two company pipelines deliver natural gas liquids to the site, where the liquids are stored in two underground caverns and piped to sites in Iowa and Wisconsin.
One cavern holds 200,000 barrels of an ethane-propane mixture.
The other holds 400,000 barrels of propane.
Mr. Neal said the fire was under control, and that he believed the fire was limited to an above-ground pump.
Mr. Neal did not yet know how operations at the facility might be affected.
