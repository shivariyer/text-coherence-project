Louisiana Land & Exploration Co. said it expects a pretax gain of about $10 million for the first quarter of 1994.
The oil and natural gas company said the gain results from a reversal of provisions the company made for settlement of a natural-gas royalty lawsuit involving the state of Louisiana and Texaco Inc.
Louisiana Land & Exploration previously announced it would pay a $5 million settlement in the lawsuit and that provisions for that payment had been made.
