China denied allegations in a Wall Street Journal report that Beijing may have transferred advanced missile technology to North Korea.
"The report of The Wall Street Journal that China possibly had provided advanced missile technology to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is totally groundless," a Foreign Ministry spokesman told the official Xinhua news agency.
On Tueday, The Wall Street Journal said some analysts at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency believed a new long-range missile being developed by North Korea showed signs of Chinese technology input.
However, the Journal said, analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency disagree with this conclusion and say the missile could have been developed domestically.
China's overseas weapons and military technology sales have been a focus of concern in Washington, which has pressed Beijing to follow a number of anti-proliferation agreements.
The arms sales issue is also an important factor in the U.S. debate over extending China's Most Favored Nation trade status, which is already tied to U.S. demands for improvement in Beijing's human-rights record.
Allegations of technology transfer to North Korea are particularly sensitive, coming on top of Pyongyang's row with the U.S. and the United Nations over its nuclear program.
