Members of the largest union at the Boston Globe, a unit of New York Times Co., voted overwhelmingly to join the Newspaper Guild, which represents 33,000 news industry workers in the U.S. and Canada.
Despite opposition by Globe management, members of the Boston Globe Employees Association, an in-house union, voted 456 to 334 last Thursday to join the Guild.
The vote follows a threeyear battle over the employees' latest contract, which was ratified last month.
It will expire at the end of this year.
The Globe union represents about 1,000 newsroom, advertising, sales, maintenance and security employees.
"We are disappointed that the members of the Boston Globe Employees Assocation saw fit to vote for affiliation with the Newspaper Guild," said Globe publisher William O. Taylor.
"As a result, we believe the employees have lost more than they have gained, including a special relationship with the Globe built over 60 years and an exclusively local focus on labor relations."
The Newspaper Guild also represents some employees at New York Times Co., which purchased the parent of the Boston Globe last year.
But a Globe spokesman said the Boston newspaper will continue to handle its own labor relations.
