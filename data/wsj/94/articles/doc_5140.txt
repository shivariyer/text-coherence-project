Equitable Cos. reversed a year-earlier loss for the fourth quarter, while Reliance Group Holdings Inc. reported disappointing results.
Equitable, which sells life insurance and other financial services, earned $83.9 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with a loss of $28.9 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 28% to $1.75 billion from $1.37 billion.
Profit from its insurance business more than doubled to $24.5 million from $10.8 million while profit from its investment businesses, which include broker Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette as well a majority stake in money manager Alliance Capital Management, rose 54% to $72.8 million from $47.2 million.
Earnings were in line with expectations.
Reliance, primarily a property and casualty insurer, reported a net loss of $15 million, or 15 cents a share, in part because of a $27.9 million charge for early retirement of debt.
A year earlier, the company had a loss of $79.6 million, or $1 a share, partly because of a $54.9 million loss on discontinued operations.
Revenue increased 7% to $778.3 million from $725.2 million.
Results from continuing operations improved, but not as much as anticipated by stock analysts.
Continuing operations earned $12.9 million, including a $16 million tax benefit, compared with a year-earlier loss of $24.7 million.
Profits were helped by better operating results on property and casualty and title insurance.
Reliance, which recently raised $200 million through the sale of common stock, estimated pretax Los Angeles earthquake losses of $17 million, which will be recognized in the first quarter.
Reliance closed yesterday at $6 a share, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The results prompted CS First Boston to slash its 1994 earnings estimate for the company to 50 cents a share from 75 cents, although it maintained its "buy" recommendation.
The brokerage company cited more conservative projections on investment income and the earthquake losses.
Separately, Nymagic Inc., a specialty property and casualty insurer, said earnings fell 59% to $2.5 million, or 22 cents a share, from $6 million, or 53 cents a share, mostly because of losses on aviation insurance and lower earnings on a profit-sharing arrangement with its reinsurers.
The reinsurance arrangement earned less because of last year's Midwest floods and 1992's Hurricane Andrew.
Reinsurance is a mechanism for insurance companies to share risks with one another.
Revenue fell 37% to $24 million from $38.1 million.
The 1992 figure includes a one-time item of $15.2 million in premiums from a reinsurance transfer.
