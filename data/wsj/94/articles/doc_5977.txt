Playtex Products Inc., Stamford, Conn., posted a large fiscal fourth-quarter loss mainly due to the extinguishment of debt associated with its recently completed recapitalization plan.
For the three months ended Dec. 25, the marketer of personal-care products posted a loss of $44.1 million compared with a loss of about $5 million in the year-earlier period.
The company, which completed an initial public offering of 20 million shares at the end of last month as part of its recapitalization plan, didn't provide per-share numbers.
The 1993 quarter included a $39.4 million charge for debt extinguishment.
Sales for the quarter were $94.8 million, up about 3% from $92 million.
The company said it will "enhance earnings as a result of continued growth from core-product categories, the distribution of Banana Boat sun-care products and deleveraging through internally generated cash flow."
