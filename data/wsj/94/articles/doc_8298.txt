Reynolds Metals Co. named Jeremiah J. Sheehan, 55 years old, president and chief operating officer.
The aluminum concern also named Randolph N. Reynolds, 52, a vice chairman.
The moves were designed to "support our strategic goals and provide for strong future succession," Chairman and Chief Executive Richard G. Holder said in a statement.
Asked about whether the move indicated Mr. Reynolds would be heir apparent to the chairman's post, and Mr. Sheehan to the chief executive's post, a company spokesman replied: "It is premature to make any assumptions right now."
Mr. Sheehan, previously an executive vice president responsible for fabricated products, assumes a post that has been vacant since April 1992, when Mr. Holder, now 62, was named chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr. Sheehan also was named a director, increasing the board to 15 members.
"Mr. Sheehan's experience and leadership will be critical to our growth in value-added products, and Mr. Reynolds to our goal of global expansion," Mr. Holder said.
Mr. Reynolds, grandson of the company's founder and a previous board member, will share the vice chairman's title with Yale M. Brandt, 63.
Mr. Reynolds was executive vice president of international.
He and Mr. Sheehan were among five executive vice presidents.
