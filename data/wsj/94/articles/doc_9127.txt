Alltel Corp., Little Rock, Ark., said Hibernia National Bank of New Orleans signed a seven-year contract under which an Alltel subsidiary will provide complete data processing services to the bank.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The telecommunications and information services company said the processing will be handled at its Systematics Financial Services division's Little Rock center.
Hibernia, which has signed merger agreements with four Louisiana financial institutions, will rely on Systematics for conversion of the banks to the common software platform.
Hibernia estimated the contract will cut its data processing costs by $40 million over the life of the contract, Alltel said.
