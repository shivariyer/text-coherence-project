Half of the young adults in the U.S. find themselves without health insurance for at least a brief period, according to a new Census Bureau report.
According to the report, half of the people from 18 to 24 years old spent at least one month without health insurance from February 1990 to September 1992.
During that period, 60 million Americans -- one person in four -- had a lapse in health coverage, according to the study.
The figures are consistent with earlier estimates of the number of people who lack insurance at various times.
In a second report, the Census Bureau said revenue for the nation's health industries exceeded $625 billion in 1992, a 9% increase from the previous year.
Hospitals claimed more than half the revenue, or $335 billion, while doctors claimed $150 billion.
Revenue for hospitals and doctors rose 8% and 9%, respectively.
Nursing homes had $42 billion in revenue, up 8% from 1991.
Home health-care and kidney-dialysis centers posted the largest annual revenue gain -- 22% each.
