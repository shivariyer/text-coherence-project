Boeing Co. said it will cut 3,000 fewer jobs than anticipated a year ago, when it forecast it would cut 27,000 jobs to accommodate a sharp slowdown in production of commercial airplanes.
The airplane maker, which has been scaling back its rate of production in the face of weak demand for jets from airlines, said it cut about 17,000 positions last year through layoffs and attrition.
Boeing already has eliminated 1,451 jobs this year, and it plans 7,000 total job reductions during 1994, with most of those occurring in the first half of the year.
While employment is declining sharply at Boeing factories in the Seattle area, about 1,000 jobs are being added in Wichita.
Kan., where the company is preparing for early phases of parts production for its new 737-700 model.
That plane, which until recently has been called the 737-X, is an advanced, remodeled version of the 737 airliner the company has been selling for 25 years.
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing shares closed at $45.125, up 62.5 cents.
