Landmark Graphics Corp., Houston, said it agreed to merge Advance Geophysical Corp. into a subsidiary in a transaction valued at more than $60 million.
The deal wouldn't involve cash, but rather an exchange of stock, a Landmark spokesman said.
Under terms in a letter of intent signed last week, Landmark would issue 2.6 million new common shares to Advance, based in Denver, in exchange for all of Advance's capital stock.
A definitive agreement is expected to be reached in about two weeks, the spokesman said.
It would call for the approval by the boards of both companies.
The transaction is expected to close by late March.
Both companies are involved in the use of computer systems for oil and gas exploration.
