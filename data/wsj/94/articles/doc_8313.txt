Immunex Corp. ended a five-month search for a new chairman and chief executive officer by naming an executive from American Cyanamid Co., which acquired a controlling interest in Immunex about a year ago.
Edward V. Fritzky, 43 years old, succeeds Steven Gillis, the biopharmaceutical firm's acting chief executive since September.
Mr. Fritzky was formerly president of Lederle Laboratories, a unit of American Cyanamid, Wayne, N.J.
Before joining Lederle in 1989, he worked at Searle Pharmaceuticals Inc., a unit of Monsanto Co., for 16 years.
As part of Cyanamid's investment in Immunex, Stephen A. Duzan resigned as chairman and chief executive, and Mr. Gillis stepped in temporarily in September amid the search for a permanent successor.
Mr. Gillis, an Immunex founder, will resume his position as Immunex executive vice president.
A company spokeswoman said Mr. Fritzky had no immediate plans to alter Immunex's strategic focus or operations.
