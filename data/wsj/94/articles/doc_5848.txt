Individual investors poured $3.27 billion into money-market mutual funds in the week ended Tuesday, as yields rose slightly following the Federal Reserve's move on Friday to raise short-term interest rates.
Assets of 441 funds open to individuals rose to $312.42 billion in the latest week, according to Money Fund Report.
Walter Frank, chief economist for the Ashland, Mass., newsletter, said investors probably were responding to the decline in the stock market and uncertainty about the bond market after the Fed's move.
Institutions, however, pulled dollars out of money funds to pursue higher yields in direct market investments.
Assets of 196 institutional funds fell by $8.14 billion to $169.14 billion, Money Fund Report said.
Mr. Frank predicted that institutions will withdraw more cash as fund yields lag behind rising yields in the open market.
In the latest week, the combined assets of all 637 taxable funds that report data to the newsletter fell by $4.87 billion to $481.56 billion.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compound yield rose to 2.75% from 2.71%, according to Money Fund Report.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments, which include commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and Treasury bills, shortened by two days to 59 days.
Shorter maturities usually coincide with rising short-term rates because they enable portfolio managers to take advantage of higher yields sooner.
The average seven-day simple yield on taxable funds rose to 2.71% from 2.68%.
The average 30-day simple yield remained at 2.69% and the average 30-day compound yield was unchanged at 2.73%.
On tax-free money funds, the average seven-day compound yield slipped to 1.82% from 1.86%.
The latest yield is equivalent to a taxable 2.84% for an investor in the 36% tax bracket and equivalent to 3.01% for someone paying 39.6% in taxes.
Assets of 343 tax-exempt funds grew by $2.5 billion to $111.9 billion, according to Money Fund Report.
Average maturity of the tax-free funds' investments shortened by one day to 56 days.
