The entertainment concern raised its quarterly dividend 20%, to 7.5 cents from 6.25 cents, payable May 20 to stock of record April 15.
The increase, Disney's seventh in seven years, came despite financial problems at the Euro Disney theme park that Chairman Michael Eisner has characterized as "dreadful."
A company spokesman noted that while net income for the Sept. 30 year plunged primarily because of a $371.5 million accounting charge related to the troubled park outside Paris, "Our three basic business operations grew in the area of 16% to 26%."
