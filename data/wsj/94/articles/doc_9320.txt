After spending almost the entire session in negative territory, small-company stocks ended the day mostly higher, with two key indexes closing at record levels.
Small-company stocks fell at the opening, on the weakness of the bond market.
But though bond prices continued to deteriorate through the day -- with the Treasury long bond posting a loss of more than a full point -- small-capitalization stocks hit their lows at midday and spent the afternoon edging back toward positive territory.
The resilience of small-cap stocks is seen by traders and analysts as an indication that the market might push higher before a widely anticipated correction.
The small-company market "is trying to correct, trying to consolidate," said Patrick Davis, head of over-the-counter trading at Salomon Brothers Inc.
He pointed out, however, that whenever the market has come under pressure recently, "people seem to step back in."
