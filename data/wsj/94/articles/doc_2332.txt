Noma Industries Ltd. said it agreed to sell its outdoor power equipment manufacturing group to Tomkins PLC of Britain for $115 million (US).
Noma said in Toronto that it recorded a charge of $24 million against its earnings for the fourth quarter related to the sale.
The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals in Canada and the U.S.
Tom Beck, chairman and chief executive officer of Noma, said that the sale will improve the company's financial position and allow it to pursue growth opportunities in its core businesses of Christmas products, notably Christmas lights and decorations, and electrical wires and parts.
The businesses sold to Tomkins include Noma's lawn mower and snow blower manufacturing operations.
