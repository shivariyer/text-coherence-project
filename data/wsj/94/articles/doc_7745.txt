I like Paul McCracken's "first, do no harm" phrase ("Unemployment -- The Crisis Continues," editorial page, Jan. 7), perhaps because I used it for the same purpose in a contribution to a 1990 edited volume, "Dissent on Keynes."
But he and I differ on the policy it implies.
To be quite blunt about it, "doing no harm" requires a wholesale rejection of aggregate macroeconomics.
The pre-Keynesians and Austrians were right to support Say's Law: free-market unemployment is always a pricing problem, and never one of "insufficient aggregate demand."
Government could help only if it could know the pattern of prices that is consistent with individuals' real preferences.
As Mises's and Hayek's work on socialist economic calculation explained, however, there is no source of knowledge of individuals' preferences except the observation of their choices in a free market.
Finally, is it not clear that Mr. McCracken's excellent analysis of labor markets hamstrung by government uncertainty describes those of the U.S., but not of capitalism?
