Two Baby Bells reported weaker results for the fourth quarter, mainly reflecting their ongoing restructuring to become more competitive and profitable.
U S West Inc., which is based in Denver, reported slimmer-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter but showed healthy growth in access lines and minutes of usage, two barometers of a Baby Bell's financial health.
U S West said net income dropped 13% to $264.1 million, or 62 cents a share, from $303.6 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier.
The 1992 quarter included a one-time gain of $41.7 million.
Excluding last year's gain, U S West said its operating profit was up slightly from $261.9 million in 1992.
Fourth-quarter revenue was $2.67 billion, up 6% from $2.51 billion a year earlier.
Pacific Telesis Group, the second regional Bell operating company, reported a fourth-quarter loss of $391 million, or 92 cents a share, compared with net income of $287 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier.
The latest quarter included a $1.01 billion restructuring charge.
Excluding special charges, the San Francisco-based company said earnings would have decreased just 3% to $279 million.
Revenue rose 1% in the fourth quarter to $2.3 billion from $2.27 billion a year earlier.
The number of access lines in U S West's 14-state territory, which stretches across the Colorado Rockies to the shores of Puget Sound, grew 3.7% to 13.8 million.
Billed minutes of usage grew 9.1% to 12.5 million.
"I was pleasantly surprised on how healthy the economic region is," said Steven Yanis, the telecommunications analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Co.
Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber, noted that U S West's growth in cash flow and cellular subscribers were both above average, indicating "good things behind the numbers."
For the year, U S West reported a net loss of $2.8 billion, or $6.69 a share, compared with a loss of $614 million, or $1.49 a share, in 1992.
The 1993 earnings include third-quarter charges of $1 billion for restructuring and a separate $3.2 billion charge for accounting changes.
U S West also took a $100 million charge during the second quarter to cover costs associated with discontinuing a financial-services business, a move that was applauded on Wall Street.
The Baby Bell announced plans last year to invest $2.5 billion for a 25% stake in Time Warner Inc.'s entertainment unit.
That deal was finalized in September.
Earlier this month, U S West said it planned to build new multimedia networks in 20 cities over the next five years, starting with a $750 million effort in four cities.
For the year, Pacific Telesis reported a net loss of $1.5 billion, or $3.63 a share.
In 1992, the Baby Bell reported net income of $1.14 billion, or $2.83 a share.
Revenue was up slightly to $9.24 billion.
Pacific Telesis, which is in the process of spinning off its cellular unit, provides local telephone services in California and Nevada.
The spinoff is expected to be completed this spring.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, U S West rose 50 cents to $43.625, and Pacific Telesis closed at $57, up 87.5 cents.
