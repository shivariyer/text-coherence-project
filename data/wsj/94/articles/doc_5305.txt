CBS Inc. reached a five-year agreement to televise Big East Conference football, completing the network's splashy re-entry onto the college gridiron.
The accord, estimated to be worth $60 million, complements a previously announced five-year $100 million contract to televise Southeastern Conference football.
Though the conferences are regional in nature -- the Big East primarily northeastern and the Southeastern Conference southern -- they have schools with national followings.
"We think it will work on a national basis and will get support from the advertising community," said Neal Pilson, CBS Sports president.
CBS had "a gleam in our eye" for college football ever since losing national-television rights to it in 1990, according to Mr. Pilson.
CBS, which also extended its Big East basketball contract by six years, won't start televising football until 1996, after the current College Football Association TV pacts expire.
Combined with another pact reached this week -- between the Atlantic Coast Conference and sister networks ABC and ESPN, the contracts mark the CFA's demise as a TV-football power.
The association had negotiated network TV contracts for 63 member schools since 1984.
The ACC, which got about $9 million last year from the CFA package, will get about $16 million a year from a combination of ABC and ESPN.
Both are units of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
ABC is also angling for another rights accord with a combination of the Southwest and Big Eight conferences, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
It is believed to be, like the ACC, for $50 million over five years.
David Downs, ABC Sports vice president, wouldn't confirm the terms.
