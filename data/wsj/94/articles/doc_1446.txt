The ruble held steady against the dollar at Friday's fixing at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, but traders said the Russian currency is likely to resume its downtrend this week.
The dollar was fixed at 1722 rubles Friday, down slightly from 1724 rubles Thursday.
"Two rubles doesn't say very much," said Igor Doronin, chief analyst at the currency exchange.
"The trend is toward a gradual, soft increase" in the dollar, he added.
Traders said demand for the ruble Friday stemmed from a coincidence of bank orders, rather than any shift in the market's overall direction.
In addition, participants said, the central bank is strictly controlling the movements of the rate.
Despite the government's recent successes in reducing inflation, traders said, the market is expecting further increases in prices and is pushing the ruble down in line with them.
Volume at Friday's fixing was moderate, with $90.7 million changing hands, up from $66.3 million Thursday.
