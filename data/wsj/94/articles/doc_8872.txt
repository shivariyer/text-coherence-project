United Parcel Service of America Inc. said it set record volumes in its U.S. air-delivery business in December, handling an average of 1,370,000 packages and documents a day.
The closely held package-delivery concern also said it expects to report revenue of about $17.5 billion for 1993, compared with $16.5 billion in 1992.
A spokesman added that the company expects 1993 profit to exceed 1992's earnings of $765 million.
Atlanta-based UPS, which has been pushing aggressively into air-express, international delivery and corporate accounts, said it set a one-day air volume record on Dec. 21, handling 2,950,000 packages.
International air volume shot up 34% in the fourth quarter from the yearearlier period.
Although the company said pricing was only one factor in the strong performance, analysts said UPS's recent discounting on corporate accounts played a big part in the growth.
