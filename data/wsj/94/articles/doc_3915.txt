Employment in the second quarter should show the strongest gains in a year, aided by significant hiring increases in the Midwest and among durable-goods manufacturers, a quarterly job-outlook survey suggests.
The survey by Manpower Inc. predicts that on a seasonally adjusted basis, 16% more employers will be adding to their work force next quarter than reducing staff.
That net-hiring increase would compare with a 13% increase in the first quarter and would match the increase of the year-earlier period.
The survey canvasses about 15,000 U.S. companies.
"The new numbers represent a modest but clear continuation in the rise of employment activity," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, president of the employment-services concern.
The anticipated nationwide increase masks wide regional differences, the survey indicates.
Some 32% of Midwest companies say they'll seek more workers in the second quarter, while only 6% plan to cut back.
Among Southern concerns, 26% plan further hiring, and 6% plan to pare staff.
The Northeast and West lag in net-hiring expectations.
By industry, makers of autos, appliances and other durable goods foresee the biggest net-hiring gains in five years.
After adjusting for seasonal factors, 23% more durable-goods manufacturers say they'll expand their work force in the second quarter than those who plan to decrease employment.
Net-hiring gains of 21% are seen in the wholesale and retail trade sector, while construction concerns anticipate a net-hiring increase of 20%, and makers of nondurable goods such as food and clothing see a 16% net-hiring gain.
The weakest industries are mining, which anticipates a 1% increase, and the transportation and public-utilities sector, forecasting a 4% gain.
