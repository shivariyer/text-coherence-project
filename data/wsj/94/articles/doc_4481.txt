Gtech Corp. got a contract to supply, operate and maintain an on-line lottery system for the National Lotteries Control Board of Trinidad and Tobago.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Gtech said the five-year contract has "extensive" options for as many as five additional years.
Under the terms of the contract, Gtech will provide a comprehensive lottery system, including a central computer, a communications network, and retailer terminals.
It will provide terminal installation and maintenance and extensive marketing support, such as game design, advertising and promotion, and retailer selection.
In addition, Gtech will supply equipment and services for its Club Keno lottery game.
The company said the lottery board expects to begin selling on-line games by this summer.
About 350 terminals will be installed initially, with plans to expand to as many as 1,000 terminals.
