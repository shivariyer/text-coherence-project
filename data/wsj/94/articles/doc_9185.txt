Americans are still moving to the South and out of the Northeast, but have slowed their overall moving around.
Overall mobility in 1991 and 1992 declined significantly from the six prior years, a report from the U.S. Census Bureau shows.
Between March 1991 and March 1992, 42.8 million people changed residences, or 17% of the total population.
The peak percentage of moves occurred in 1960-61, when 20.6% of the population changed residences, closely followed by 1984-85, when 20.2% of the population moved.
In the latest survey, most of the movers packed up for homes or apartments across town -- 26.6 million people, or 10.7% of the total population, moved within the same county.
Most of these moves, the Census Bureau said, were probably prompted by marriages, divorces, births or other events that alter housing needs.
In contrast, 6% of the population moved to a different county, and 2.9% moved to a different state.
Not surprisingly, young adults moved around the most.
One-third of all people in their twenties changed addresses.
The South, which began experiencing net new residents during the 1960s, saw a net gain of 224,000 new residents in 1991-92.
The Northeast, meanwhile, experienced a net loss of 292,000.
Roughly the same amount of people moved into and out of the Midwest and the West.
