A federal court jury has rejected a Texas man's claim that Upjohn's Halcion sleeping pill caused him to try to take his own life and that of his wife.
This is the second time a jury has decided in favor of Upjohn Co., based in Kalamazoo, Mich.
In this case, Milton Williams claimed that in 1988, Halcion caused him to become suicidal, homicidal and psychotic, requiring hospitalization in a psychiatric institution.
Mr. Williams said his behavior culminated in an attempt to murder his wife and commit suicide.
He contended that Upjohn withheld information about Halcion's side effects from physicians and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Mr. Williams sought damages of more than $10 million.
But the plaintiff couldn't prove that Upjohn committed fraud or failed to disclose important facts about Halcion.
Upjohn said the verdict is a vindication of Halcion.
"It supports the company's long-held position that Halcion is safe and effective when used as recommended," said Ley S. Smith, Upjohn's president and operating chief.
