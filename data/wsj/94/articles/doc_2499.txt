Standard & Poor's Corp. placed Chrysler's senior debt on review for a possible upgrade, following the auto maker's highly profitable fourth quarter.
The review comes after S&P restored Chrysler's investment-grade rating in October.
S&P said the company's "well-received new products" have positioned it to benefit from the recovering North American vehicle market.
And it added that "prospects are favorable for significant additional improvement in earnings and cash flow over the next few years."
S&P placed on review for possible upgrade Chrysler's senior debt, its preferred stock rating, and the senior and subordinated debt of Chrysler Financial Corp., a subsidiary.
Consolidated debt under review is $11.5 billion.
S&P affirmed, and didn't place on review, the A-2 commercial paper rating of the company's financial subsidiary.
