MTC Electronic Technologies Co. said its board ousted its chairman and fired him as the company's chief executive officer following allegations of financial improprieties.
In a news release issued from Hong Kong, the Vancouver consumer-electronics company said its board voted to remove Miko Leung and his brother Sit Wa Leung from all offices they currently occupy in the company, its subsidiaries and affiliates.
It said the Leungs were also asked to resign as directors, but refused.
The company said that its board will immediately launch a search for qualified successors to the Leungs, that its vice chairman, Edilberto Pozon, agreed to serve as interim chief executive, and that it designated Mr. Pozon and the company's two remaining directors as an executive committee with broad powers to supervise its management.
Before yesterday's Hong Kong board meeting, Miko Leung, who founded MTC, was the company's chairman, president and chief executive.
Sit Wa Leung was its vice president of operations and corporate secretary.
MTC said that its auditors discovered that MTC employees who were purportedly granted options on 800,000 of the company's shares hadn't received the options.
Instead, the options were exercised, the stock sold and the proceeds either received by Miko Leung or paid for his benefit, the company said.
It didn't disclose the amount of proceeds.
The Leungs, whom MTC says are in Hong Kong, couldn't be reached for comment.
In its news release, MTC said that Miko Leung stated to the company's board that he received no personal benefits from the stock-option transactions.
