KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said it will hold the stake in its U.S. affiliate Northwest Airlines Corp. at around 20% following Northwest's initial public offering of 20 million Class A common shares.
KLM has a 7.5% voting stake in Northwest.
Northwest on Tuesday said it expects to raise about $400 million in equity through the offering, which it expects to occur in the first quarter.
The Dutch carrier said it will maintain its stake in Northwest via an exchange of preferred shares for common stock among existing shareholders.
KLM's loans to Northwest have been carried on Northwest's books as preferred stock, a KLM spokesman said.
KLM in 1991 and 1992 wrote off the entire value of its original $400 million investment in Northwest, despite the fact that KLM has considered the loans as subordinated debt.
