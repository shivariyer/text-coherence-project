The Securities and Exchange Commission said it obtained an $89 million judgment in British court against Eddie Antar, founder of the nowdefunct Crazy Eddie Inc. consumer electronics chain.
The judgment will allow the SEC to attempt to collect money from Mr. Antar's holdings in Britain, according to SEC lawyer Richard Wallace.
The SEC, alleging federal securities violations, obtained a $73.5 million judgment against Mr. Antar in the U.S. in July 1990.
With interest, the judgment now totals $89 million; however, it wasn't enforceable without foreign court orders.
Mr. Antar, who was extradited from Israel about a year ago, was convicted in the U.S. of stock fraud and racketeering for inflating Crazy Eddie's market value through phony sales and inventory reports.
Now in federal prison, he continues to fight civil cases pending against him in Britain, Israel and Switzerland.
The SEC said Mr. Antar is appealing the British court's judgment that was entered last week.
