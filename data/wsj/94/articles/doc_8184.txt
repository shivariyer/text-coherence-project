Cyrix Corp. won the first round in yet another legal battle with rival Intel Corp. over its right to sell computer chips that are clones of Intel's.
A federal judge in Sherman, Texas, ruled on one of three issues in a complex suit filed in 1991 by Cyrix in a debate concerning patents held by Intel.
In the ruling, the judge said that Intel may not collect royalties from Cyrix customers who bought clones of Intel's 386 and 486 chips that were manufactured by Cyrix's primary subcontractor.
That subcontractor is licensed by Intel and, the judge said, rights under the license in effect pass through both to Cyrix and its customers.
The microprocessors act as the brains of many personal computers, and Intel, Santa Clara, Calif., dominates the PC-chip business.
Its 1993 sales were $8.8 billion, more than 85 times those of Cyrix.
Intel intends to appeal the ruling, said Thomas Dunlap, Intel's general counsel.
"This is a legal loss, but it doesn't change anything from a business standpoint for Intel.
It's part of an ongoing attempt to give a return to our shareholders when the government gives us a patent right."
Intel has used the legal system aggressively to protect such rights, most frequently clashing with Advanced Micro Devices Inc., another Silicon Valley chip maker.
A Cyrix news release referred to Intel's "systematic campaign of intimidation and harassment of Cyrix customers demanding they either use Intel microprocessors . . . or pay Intel an exorbitant royalty."
Jerry Rogers, Cyrix president and chief executive officer, said his customers "resent Intel's monopolistic behavior."
Mr. Dunlap said Intel's royalty, representing 1% of a computer's sale price, is not exorbitant considering "the going rate is 3% to 5%."
Today the judge is to begin considering other aspects of the suit, including the validity of the patent in question and whether a royalty should apply to chips made by nonlicensed Cyrix contractors.
