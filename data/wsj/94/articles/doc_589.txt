Machine-tool orders fell 22% in February from January, but analysts said orders remained at a relatively high level.
February's orders totaled $280.8 million, down from $360.2 million.
The Association for Manufacturing Technology, which compiles the figures, called February's orders "very good," especially when compared with the year-earlier period, which was one of the industry's strongest Februarys.
Compared with February 1993's $282.7 million, orders fell only 1%.
"That's a good harbinger of continued strong growth in order activity during 1994," the association said.
During 1994's first two months, orders totaled $641 million, up 40% from $458.2 million in the year-earlier period.
Machine tools cut and form metal parts for other machines.
Their orders are considered an indicator of future economic activity because the products are shipped nine to 18 months later.
"What you have out there is definitely a recovery under way, but it is definitely a recovery that can be characterized as sluggish . . . by historic standards," said John E. McGinty, an analyst with CS First Boston in Boston.
Mitchell I. Quain, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co. in New York, added that overseas competitors are targeting the U.S. market to offset weak markets at home.
The competition is keeping U.S. machine-tool makers from getting "their fair share" of orders, he said.
Still, there is strength in the orders, analysts said.
U.S. auto makers, which drove machine-tool orders last year, continue to place orders as they strive to keep up with demand, increase productivity and turn out new vehicle lines more quickly.
Moreover, the economy's growth is pushing manufacturers such as appliance makers to step up purchases of machine tools.
That strength was displayed in orders to the nation's machine-tool distributors.
According to an index based on orders over a three-year period, distributors' orders in February rose 10% from January and 11% from February 1993, the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association said.
According to the Association for Manufacturing Technology, domestic orders fell 24% in February from January, to $263.9 million from $349.4 million, but rose 7% from $246.4 million in February 1993.
On a year-to-date basis, domestic orders jumped 58%, to $613.3 million from $387.4 million in the year-earlier period.
Orders for export soared 56% in February to $16.9 million from $10.8 million in January.
But January's orders were considered low.
And compared with February 1993 orders for export dropped 54% from $36.3 million.
For 1994 through February, orders for export plunged 61% to $27.7 million from $70.8 million in the same period last year.
