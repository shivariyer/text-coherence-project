John Labatt Ltd. said it ended a lockout at its Quebec brewery after more than 1,000 unionized employees reversed a vote and approved the company's contract.
The lockout, which began three weeks ago, had shut down about 30% of Labatt's domestic beer production.
The Toronto-based company said it must cut its production costs because of an expected increase in low-priced imports from the U.S. following last summer's beer-trade agreement.
The Labatt workers' new three-year contract provides no wage increases in the first year and 2% raises in each of the following two years.
Alain Bolduc, spokesman for Labatt's Quebec operation, said the contract also allows the company to hire part-time workers for weekend shifts during heavy beer-consumption months.
The company previously paid its regular employees overtime for weekend work.
