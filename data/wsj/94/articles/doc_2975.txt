"Portrait of a Lady: Sweet Life Preserved" (Leisure & Arts, Feb. 9) was an unexpected gem.
It isn't often we get such enjoyment among all the world-wide news, business, advertisements, etc.
I have never seen a fig tree, eaten a fig, or had the delight of eating velvety textured fig jam spread on a biscuit, or made the acquaintance of blue-ribbon Minnie Robichaux.
Her grandson, Mark Robichaux, has introduced us and I thank him for it.
It stirred the hearts of all grandmothers as we shared this tribute to his own grandmother.
I have saved the article as well as her prize fig jam recipe.
