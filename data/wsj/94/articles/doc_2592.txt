Artemis SA, a Paris-based holding company, said it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Prime Equipment unit, including a possible sale.
Prime Equipment, based in Houston, is a U.S. equipment rental company serving the construction and industrial markets.
Its 1994 revenue is expected to approach $200 million.
Closely held Artemis retained Banexi International, the U.S. investment banking unit of Banque Nationale de Paris, as its adviser.
