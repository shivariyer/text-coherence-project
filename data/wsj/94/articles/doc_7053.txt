Coca-Cola Co. has redesigned the can for Coca-Cola Classic.
The new can features two drawings of the contoured Coke bottle, a familiar trademark for the brand that Coke wants to capitalize on, industry executives have said.
The Atlanta company is gradually rolling out the can, with plans for nationwide distribution by the middle of the year, a spokeswoman said.
Coke wouldn't provide further details.
Soft-drink executives have said they are spiffing up their packages this year and introducing lots of products as part of an effort to revive consumer interest in what has been a slowing domestic soft-drink market.
Last month PepsiCo Inc. changed its Diet Pepsi label and the design for its multipack cardboard boxes for other big brands.
