For the eighth consecutive week, yields on taxable money-market funds rose in the week ended Tuesday, pushing within a hair of the 3% mark.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compound yield on taxable funds rose to 2.98% from 2.90%, according to Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass., newsletter.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
The seven-day simple yield on taxable funds edged up to 2.93% from 2.86%, while the 30-day simple yield rose to 2.86% from 2.82%.
The 30-day compound yield inched up to 2.90% from 2.86%.
Assets of 649 taxable funds (three more than the previous week) fell by $4.69 billion, to $476.16 billion, the newsletter said.
Institutional investors accounted for $4.13 billion of the outflow, while individual investors took out the remaining $560.5 million.
Walter Frank, chief economist for Money Fund Report, attributed the rising yields to last week's rise in short-term yields by the Federal Reserve.
Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments, which include commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and Treasury bills, shortened by one day to 48 days.
The average tax-exempt seven-day compound yield slipped to 1.78% from 1.82%, in the latest week.
The latest tax-free yield is equivalent to a taxable 2.78% for someone paying 36% in taxes and to 2.95% for those who pay 39.6%.
Assets of 354 tax-exempt funds (six more than last week) decreased by $624.1 million, to $115.88 billion, according to the newsletter.
The tax-free funds' average portfolio maturity shortened by two days to 51 days.
