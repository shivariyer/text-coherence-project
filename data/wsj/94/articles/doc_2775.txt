Japanese electrical machinery maker Hitachi Ltd. plans to establish a subsidiary to make disk drives in the Philippines in May.
Hitachi said it would name the company Hitachi Computer Products (Asia) Corp. and capitalize it at 1.12 billion Philippine pesos ($41.4 million).
The subsidiary is to compete in the low end of the small-disk-drive market.
Production is to start in June 1995, with expected sales of about 17 billion yen ($160.7 million) in the fiscal first year.
Hitachi has been producing 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch disk drives but in September entered an agreement with MiniStor Peripherals Corp. of the U.S. to license technology for 2.5-inch and 1.8-inch units.
