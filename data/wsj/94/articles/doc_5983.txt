Littlefield, Adams & Co., a subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry, asked that trading in its shares be halted because of pending corporate news, but the company, which sells leisure wear and medical products, didn't make any announcement by the close of business.
The American Stock Exchange didn't begin trading the stock yesterday morning, saying a company announcement was expected.
Later yesterday, the exchange said trading wouldn't resume.
A Littlefield spokesman said he expects the company to make the announcement within a few days.
On Tuesday, Littlefield's stock fell $1.375 to $19.375 after the company issued a news release about the SEC inquiry.
Littlefield said it issued that release only because a recent television report had suggested the SEC probe was new when, in fact, it was announced last summer.
