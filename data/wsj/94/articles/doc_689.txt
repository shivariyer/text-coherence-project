Air Canada said it will contract out its information systems activities to a newly created unit of IBM Canada Ltd.
IBM Canada is a unit of International Business Machines Corp.
Under the so-called outsourcing agreement, Air Canada will award contracts totaling 800 million Canadian dollars (US$582.9 million) over seven years to the IBM Canada unit.
Air Canada, in turn, will receive C$50 million for assets and business to be transferred to the new company.
The Montreal-based airline expects the arrangement to result in savings of about 10%, compared with the cost of providing the data services internally.
Air Canada also said it is setting up a new unit, Galileo Canada Inc., to handle its computer reservation business.
