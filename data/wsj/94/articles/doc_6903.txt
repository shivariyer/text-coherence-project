Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., Houston, said it will spend $81 million for its 1994 capital and exploration budget, 60% more than the $50.6 million budgeted in 1993.
Actual capital expenditures for 1993 totaled $136.3 million because of acquisitions that the company made during the year.
A company spokesman said only the acquisitions for which the company has signed agreements in hand are included in the initial budget.
At this time, 1994 acquisition funds are set at $24.2 million, compared with 1993's actual expenditures of $86.6 million.
The budget also includes $39.7 million for drilling and workovers compared with $36.3 million last year.
Cabot said it plans to drill 150 wells in the Appalachian region and 21 wells in the Anadarko region of South Central U.S.
