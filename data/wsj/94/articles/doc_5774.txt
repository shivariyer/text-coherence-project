The average rate on a conventional 30-year mortgage jumped to 7.30% this week following the Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates last week.
The increase, up from last week's 7.08%, is based on a preliminary survey by HSH Associates, a publisher of mortgage rates in Butler, N.J.
The rate is still historically low and analysts don't expect any rapid short-term changes.
Major lenders immediately raised their rates after the Fed's announcement, but as the shock wore off rates started to move down again this week to yesterday's preliminary 7.30%.
Keith T. Gumbinger, an analyst at HSH, said the final rate for the week would likely drop slightly lower.
Rates fell as low as 6.83% in October before cresting at 7.40% in November.
Since then rates have been drifting up and down until this week's spike.
"Mortgage interest rates are expected to remain at their current levels for the near term," said Frank Nothaft, an economist at Freddie Mac.
"We don't foresee any further moves by the Fed to tighten monetary policy."
