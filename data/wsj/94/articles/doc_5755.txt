President Clinton said he intends to nominate securities lawyer Steven Wallman to the Securities and Exchange Commission, filling a commissioner's seat that has been vacant nearly two years.
Mr. Wallman, 40 years old, is a partner in the Washington law firm Covington & Burling.
He said he wouldn't have any comment until he is confirmed by the Senate.
In a statement, Mr. Clinton said Mr. Wallman "will make an excellent addition to the SEC," adding that the intended nominee "has long been recognized as a leading expert on securities law, and has been actively engaged in the fight for sensible regulation in that area."
Among other things, Mr. Wallman drafted legislation that was adopted in Pennsylvania and Ohio to help deter corporate raiders.
He also has represented the National Football League in corporate matters.
At the NFL, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Mr. Wallman is "uniquely qualified, with very broad experience that has earned him great support from diverse labor, investor and business groups."
Mr. Wallman's confirmation would give the SEC its first full complement of five members since early 1992, when Commissioner Edward Fleischman left.
SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said he is "looking forward to working with Steve.
His experience will make a valuable contribution to the commission's efforts to protect American investors."
