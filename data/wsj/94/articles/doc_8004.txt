Viewlogic Systems Inc. expects to report sharply higher fourth-quarter net income of $4.9 million, or 30 cents a share, on a 49% jump in revenue to $29.3 million, Alain Hanover, president and chief executive, said.
In an interview, Mr. Hanover also said the Marlborough, Mass., software maker would grow again this year by "two and a half to three times" the 10% annual growth rate that analysts predict for the rest of the electronic-design software market.
In the year-before fourth quarter, earnings were $3.4 million, or 23 cents a share, before a nonrecurring charge of $1.4 million related to an acquisition.
Revenue was $19.7 million.
Viewlogic's software is used by automobile, semiconductor and computer makers to build electronic circuits.
It allows them to design these circuits without building prototypes.
