Spain's chief public prosecutor said he will request information from the Bank of Spain as the first step in an investigation into whether the former management of Banco Espanol de Credito committed any wrongdoing.
The Bank of Spain ousted the chairman and board of Banesto, as Spain's fourth-largest bank is known, on Dec. 28, as the bank's troubles became clear.
At the time, Bank of Spain Gov. Luis Angel Rojo said state inspectors had found no indication of wrongdoing.
But later inspections of Banesto's accounts have turned up documents that were off limits to central bank inspectors before the takeover.
If these documents fail to show evidence of criminal offenses, the prosecutor's office said it will shelve the investigation.
Meanwhile, Banesto's caretaker chairman, Alfredo Saenz, asked the National Stock Exchange Commission not to resume trading in the bank's shares this month to give the new management time to draw up a draft reorganization plan.
Banesto may have to write off its potential losses against capital and reserves, which stood at 359 billion pesetas ($2.48 billion) on June 30.
A write-down could render Banesto's shares almost worthless, a fact that commission officials said holders should know before trading in the bank's shares resumes.
