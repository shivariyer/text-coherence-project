Canadian manufacturers recorded a 6.2% rise in new orders in December from November, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
The new orders included large export contracts for aircraft, railroad rolling stock and machinery.
Manufacturers' shipments declined 0.1% in December from November, partly because of a temporary shutdown of some auto plants for model changes.
Before December, shipments had increased for four consecutive months.
