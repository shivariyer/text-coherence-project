Reichmann International L.P., a venture between Canada's Reichmann family and financier George Soros, said it will form a Mexican real-estate development venture with Empresas ICA SA.
The venture will undertake a 30-building project at sites around Mexico City comprising more than 3.56 million square feet.
The venture will also design and build projects at the Santa Fe office and shopping complex west of Mexico City, Reichmann said.
The companies didn't put a value on the venture.
