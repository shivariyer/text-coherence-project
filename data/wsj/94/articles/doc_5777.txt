Viacom Inc. accused rival QVC Network Inc. of breaking the bidding rules in the takeover battle for Paramount Communications Inc. by talking about possible future purchases of QVC's stock.
Some analysts and investors who attended a meeting Tuesday with QVC chairman Barry Diller said he indicated the cable shopping service was exploring ways to bolster the value of QVC shares being offered for Paramount, including possible plans for QVC's investors to announce future purchases of QVC stock.
But QVC has said it made no such promises or hints in those meetings.
Viacom called the reported statements "crude attempts at market manipulation," and "a backdoor attempt by QVC to change its offer after the Feb. 1 deadline established by the Paramount board."
Traders have until Monday to decide which offer to accept.
Last night, QVC responded that Viacom "is either suing or complaining or just making noise.
We have done nothing improper."
A person close to QVC also said the company might issue a statement on the "issues" as early as today or that it might even place newspaper ads on Monday to explain its position.
