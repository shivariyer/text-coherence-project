The European Union's top competition official is seeking an extraordinary order to bar the injection of additional French state aid into the ailing state-owned computer company Cie. des Machines Bull, officials said.
The EU competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, is urging the full EU Commission to extend an earlier probe into 2.5 billion francs ($421.5 million) of state aid provided to Bull last February to cover an additional 8.6 billion francs recently announced by the French government, people close to the EU said.
About three-fourths of the 8.6 billion francs already has been disbursed, but Mr. Van Miert seeks the order to prevent the remainder from being transferred pending completion of the probe.
The new steps on Bull reflect growing impatience in Brussels over the failure of the French government and state-owned French Telecom, which own 90% of Bull, to submit a restructuring plan to the commission.
EU officials insist the state aid to Bull is illegal unless the funds are used to make the company viable through a restructuring blueprint.
Bull showed a loss of nearly five billion francs in 1992 and had a further deficit of two billion francs in the first half of 1993.
