Dofasco Inc. said a group of investment dealers agreed to purchase its Prudential Steel Ltd. unit for 100 million Canadian dollars (US$72.8 million).
Dofasco, a steelmaker based in Hamilton, Ontario, said the group, led by RBC Dominion Securities Inc. of Toronto, plans to sell the shares of Prudential to the public through an initial offering.
Calgary, Alberta-based Prudential makes carbon steel tubular products used in the oil-and-gas industry.
It also makes certain industrial steel products.
A spokesman for Dofasco said the company expects to record a one-time gain of about C$60 million in the second quarter, in which the transaction is expected to close.
