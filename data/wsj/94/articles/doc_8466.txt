The general partners of 17 limited partnerships that own self-service storage centers modified a proposal to consolidate the partnerships into a publicly traded real estate investment trust.
The new proposal gives limited partners the option to receive as much as $180 million in cash along with stock in the new company.
The original proposal offered six-year notes along with stock.
The revised bid competes with a sweetened bid by U-Haul International Inc. to acquire the partnerships for $357.5 million in cash.
The general partners yesterday recommended a rejection of the latest U-Haul offer.
The general partners have valued the partnerships' assets at $387.5 million, and contend the consolidated REIT could be valued at even more by the stock market.
The limited partnerships are managed by Shurgard Inc. of Seattle, whose controlling shareholder is a general partner of all of the partnerships.
Phoenix-based U-Haul, is controlled by the Shoen family through its Nevada holding company, Amerco.
