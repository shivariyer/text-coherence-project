The value of announced mergers and acquisitions rose 86% in 1993 to a level that hasn't been seen since the late 1980s, a Merrill Lynch & Co. survey found.
The total value of proposed transactions disclosing a purchase price was $176.4 billion, compared with $94.9 billion in 1992.
But the number of such deals remained relatively steady.
In all, 2,664 transactions were announced during the year, a mere 4% increase from a year ago, according to the survey by Business Advisory Services, a division of Merrill Lynch based in Schaumburg, Ill.
The total value of mergers and acquisitions, which was as high as $246.9 billion in 1988, began dropping significantly in 1990.
The lowest value in recent years came in 1991, when deals totaled $71.2 billion, according to Merrill Lynch data.
Giant deals -- $1 billion or more -- showed the sharpest rise.
The total value of these deals jumped 241% to $101 billion from $29.6 billion in 1992.
There were 27 $1 billion-plus transactions announced last year, compared with 17 in 1992.
The number of deals valued at more than $100 million rose 22% and their total value doubled, the survey said.
The biggest deal announced during the year was Bell Atlantic Corp.'s acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc.
Merrill Lynch valued the deal at $16 billion.
Of the year's 15 largest deals, six were in the broadcast and communications industry.
About 22% of the year's mergers and acquisitions were deals between U.S. and foreign companies, a number consistent with 1992 levels.
However, the number of foreign buyers grew to 190, up 16% from a year ago.
The U.K. remained the most active arena for both foreign acquisitions and sales, with 52 buyers and 83 sellers, followed by Canada, with 44 buyers and 49 sellers, Merrill Lynch said.
Banking and finance was the most active industry in the mergers-and-acquisitions field.
There were 296 deals in that industry in 1993, compared with 268 a year earlier.
The survey also found that the total value of banking-and-finance deals rose 59% to $26.2 billion from $16.5 billion.
Based on the 929 transactions for which method-of-payment information was available, Merrill Lynch said 40% of 1993 mergers and acquisitions were all-stock deals, and 25% involved only cash.
The other 35% involved some combination of cash, stock and debt.
