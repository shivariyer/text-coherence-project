Rogers Communications Inc. is seeking a court order to force Maclean Hunter Ltd. to include it in any auction of the latter's Canadian cable-television assets.
Rogers, as previously reported, has bid 2.79 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.09 billion) to acquire all shares of Maclean Hunter, a Toronto printing and publishing concern.
But directors of Maclean Hunter have rejected the C$17-a-share offer.
The company is now considering the sale of its extensive Canadian cable operations, the asset in which Rogers has the greatest interest.
In its action, filed in the Supreme Court of Ontario, Rogers is asking the court to order Maclean Hunter to turn over any information available to interested bidders for any Maclean Hunter assets.
Last week, Maclean Hunter set up "data rooms" on cable and other operations.
Rogers said Maclean Hunter barred it from looking at certain data unless Rogers dropped its bid.
Rogers is a Toronto telecommunications concern.
