Utilx Corp. said it will post a small loss for its fourth quarter ending March 31, because of bad weather in the Eastern U.S. that hampered the company's utility renovation business.
Analysts had been expecting a profit of about 10 cents a share, the company said.
For the year-earlier period, Utilx reported a loss of $5.2 million, or 73 cents a share, on sales of $11.2 million.
