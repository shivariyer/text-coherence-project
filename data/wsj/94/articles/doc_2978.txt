Mark Swed's review of Kurt Weill's "Street Scene" and "Seven Deadly Sins" ("Weill Celebrated on Stage, Disk and Video," Leisure & Arts, Feb. 15) was a thoughtful and welcome appraisal of one of the greatest theater composers of the century.
Unfortunately, he threw in a mean swipe at "Finian's Rainbow," another masterwork of the period, dismissing it as sentimental, banal and uncomplicated.
Careful observers of American musical theater are aware of the many trashy songs cluttering the field and appreciative of the pleasures available from artful combinations of music and lyrics when they appear.
The music of Burton Lane and the words of E.Y. Harburg for "Finian's Rainbow" are among the best in the form.
Far from "uncomplicated," Harburg's story dealt with the American South in 1947, and the possibility of sharecroppers of both races owning the land they worked together.
A subplot involved a bigoted senator magically transformed into the race he persecuted.
As always, Harburg delivered his message with optimism and humor.
Art is not an Olympic game with winners and losers.
A Gold for Weill is entirely compatible with a Gold for Harburg and Lane.
