U.S. official reserve assets rose $1.52 billion in February, to $75.77 billion, the Treasury Department said.
The increase compared with an $801 million rise in reserve assets in January, to $74.24 billion, the department said.
U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold, special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign currencies -- at the IMF.
The nation's holdings of foreign currencies increased $1.23 billion in February to $43.44 billion, while gold reserves remained unchanged at $11.05 billion.
U.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights last month rose $225 million to $9.3 billion, and its reserve position at the IMF rose $68 million to $11.97 billion.
