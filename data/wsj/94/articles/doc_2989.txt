British Aerospace PLC, or BAe, confirmed that it has held talks with the French state-owned arms manufacturer Giat on a potential alliance, but said a news report about the discussions overstated matters.
A spokesman for BAe described the talks as "very, very tentative."
His comments were in reaction to a report in the Monday edition of the Financial Times newspaper that said the talks are about a collaboration between Giat and the Royal Ordnance unit of British Aerospace, the group's weapons subsidiary.
The spokesman added that Giat is only one of the numerous companies British Aerospace has been in talks with about joint business prospects.
British Aerospace has been in long-running discussions with another French concern, the Matra-Hachette group, as well.
