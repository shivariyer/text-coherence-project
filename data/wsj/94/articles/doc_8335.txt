Most of the 10 domestic auto makers fell short of their production estimates for last week because of severe weather throughout the Midwest and some Southern states.
The auto makers cited parts shortages, insufficient energy supplies and low worker turnout for canceling work shifts at various assembly plants.
In addition, most of the auto makers were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.
Altogether, the domestic auto makers said they planned to build 205,582 cars and trucks in the week ended Friday, a decrease of 1.8% from the 209,346 vehicles built a year earlier.
