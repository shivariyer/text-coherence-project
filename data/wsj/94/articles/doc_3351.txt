GNI Group Inc., Houston, said it expects to report a substantial loss on a decline in revenue for the fiscal third quarter ending March 31.
GNI said revenue is projected at $5 million to $5.5 million.
The environmental and recycling company had net income $549,311, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $5.9 million in the year-earlier quarter.
GNI said it also expects a fourth-quarter loss, compared with earnings of $769,638, or 12 cents a share, on revenue of $6.3 million in the 1993 fourth quarter.
Results should improve in the first two quarters of 1995, the company said.
The company had a loss of $63,346, or one cent a share, on revenue of $5.2 million in the 1994 first quarter and a loss of 156,367, or two cents a share, on revenue of $5.1 million in the second quarter.
Carl V. Rush Jr., president and chief executive, said GNI will address difficulties in its chemical recovery and processing operation with "personnel reduction, reorganization and restructuring."
