Profit-takers, spurred on by higher interest rates, jumped in to reverse four straight sessions of small-company stock gains.
"This was just a little sell-off in what's been a very powerful market," said Richard Holden, manager of Nasdaq trading at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc.
"Pretty much everything was for sale today, but there hasn't been any kind of panic selling."
The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks the performance of small-capitalization stocks traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market and the major exchanges, didn't fare too badly and managed to recoup some of its earlier losses.
The barometer finished down just 0.02, or 0.01%, at 266.50, after being down nearly a point during the session.
The Russell had set closing highs in the previous two sessions.
The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 3.23, or 0.40%, to 797.24, well above its low for the day, when it had slumped about 5 1/2 points.
Weak technology and health-care issues caused most of the damage.
Nasdaq decliners led advancers, 1,666 to 1,459, on Nasdaq National Market volume of 285,624,250 shares and total volume of 339,754,000 shares.
Monday, National Market volume was 278,502,500 shares and total turnover hit 329,921,800.
Some technology stocks weakened.
JetForm, a Canadian software firm, lost 1 to 10 1/4; Chips & Technologies, a San Jose, Calif., integrated circuit designer, gave up 1/2 to 5 1/4, and Trinzic, a Palo Alto, Calif., software company, was off 1/2 at 5 3/8.
But Aldus, Seattle, was the sector's big decliner, tumbling 4 to 22 1/4 on disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.

Interest-rate-sensitive stocks, which had held up well in recent sessions, slipped as bonds fell.
U.S. Facilities, a Costa Mesa, Calif., insurance company, retreated 1 to 10 1/2; Victoria Financial, Cleveland, declined 3/4 to 8 1/2, and Silicon Valley Bancshares, San Jose, Calif., slipped 3/4 to 9 1/4.

The Sunnyvale, Calif., company develops tools for computer software design applications.
Kathy Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, Greenwich, Conn., said MapInfo, Digital Link and ParcPlace "were three of the quality deals on the calendar."
She added that because "they're not enormous in size, their prices got pushed up a lot by all the investors who wanted to get in on the deals."
