Intel Corp. soon will have another upstart competitor, a small Silicon Valley company with some powerful allies.
NexGen Microproducts Inc., after seven years of struggle, on Monday will unveil what amounts to the first clone of Intel's highly touted Pentium microprocessor, according to people familiar with the company's plans.
The chip, called the Nx586, is designed to run the same software as the Intel chip but uses a different hardware design, forcing NexGen to convince personal computer makers to shift to different circuit boards than the ones used for Intel's products.
But NexGen has some important financial backers.
Investors include Compaq Computer Corp., Italy's Ing.
C. Olivetti & Co., Japanese publishing and computer software concern Ascii Corp. and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a large San Francisco-based venture firm.
Together, the companies have already sunk $90 million into the company, which is based in Milpitas, Calif.
NexGen also may land International Business Machines Corp. to manufacture NexGen's chips at a factory in Burlington, Vt.
IBM built NexGen's sample chips, and a former IBM executive, Paul Low, is a NexGen director.
But an IBM spokesman says that no deal has been reached to build NexGen's chips.
"We have had discussions with them, but we don't have an agreement," he said.
IBM's help could be crucial.
Not many manufacturing companies have the advanced factories needed to build Pentium-class processors.
Fewer still have patent cross-license arrangements with Intel -- as IBM does -- that can provide a defense to any patent litigation from Intel.
Other makers of clones of Intel chips, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp., have struggled to find so-called foundries to give them sufficient capacity to serve the market.
Intel, with 74% of the $8.8 billion microprocessor market, according to Dataquest Inc., has been investing steadily in new plants and equipment.
Manufacturing is "one of the biggest hurdles NexGen faces," said one chip-industry observer familiar with the company's plans.
He also predicts that NexGen may face more questions than competitors about whether it offers true compatibility with Intel's chips.
NexGen's design removes so-called floating-point functions that give the Pentium chip sophisticated graphics performance, but aren't required by many standard personal computers.
NexGen offers an additional chip to complete all of those functions.
The Nx586 will come in two speeds, 60 megahertz and 66 megahertz, that are expected to be about as fast as Intel's Pentium chips operating at those frequencies.
It will be priced at $460, or about $300 less than comparable Pentiums, plus an extra $128 for the floating-point accessory chip, knowledgeable people said.
Another problem for NexGen is that Intel just boosted the speed of Pentium by introducing models operating at 90 megahertz and 100 megahertz, analysts noted.
No major PC makers have committed to the Nx586 yet, but industry observers expect a handful of smaller companies to announce plans to make NexGen-based PCs.
