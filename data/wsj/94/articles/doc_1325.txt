HarCor Energy Inc. said it will report a narrower fourth-quarter loss than a year earlier.
HarCor's year-earlier fourth-quarter loss was $712,000, or 13 cents a share, on revenue of $1.1 million.
The oil and natural-gas company blamed the loss in the most recent period on the depreciation of certain reserves due to lower oil prices.
The Houston company also said it expects a narrower loss for the full year 1993.
In 1992 HarCor had a net loss of $1.4 million, or 40 cents a share, on revenue of $3.2 million.
HarCor said its gas reserves, as of Dec. 31, were 17 billion cubic feet, compared with 6.6 billion a year earlier.
Oil reserves were 1.7 million barrels on Dec. 31, compared with 1.3 million a year earlier.
