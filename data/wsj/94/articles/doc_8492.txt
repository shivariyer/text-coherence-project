Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it plans to explore the possibility of selling PG&E Resources, its Dallas-based oil and gas exploration and production company.
A spokesman said the board determined that the unit "doesn't quite fit" with the company's long-term strategy, adding that it contributes only a "minuscule" amount to earnings.
PG&E Resources is a small part of the energy concern's unregulated-business sector; its major unregulated business is independent power plants.
San Francisco-based PG&E said the company has no prospective buyers but that it has retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. as financial adviser in the effort.
