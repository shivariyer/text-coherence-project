J.C. Penney Co. said it will set up an import/export trading branch in Mexico City next month to serve its retail operations in Mexico and the U.S.
The new venture, named JCPenney Mexican Trading Co., will buy merchandise for the company's Mexican stores and identify Mexican brands that have potential for Penney stores and catalogs in the U.S.
