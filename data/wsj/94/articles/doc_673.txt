French tire and rubber group Michelin SA said it plans to shut down its truck tire-manufacturing facility at Hertogenbosch, in the Netherlands, citing overcapacity caused by the slump in European truck sales.
The plant employs 432 workers.
The European truck market has been hit by the slump in economic activity over the past two years, and Michelin said it doesn't see any prospect of a recovery in the near future.
