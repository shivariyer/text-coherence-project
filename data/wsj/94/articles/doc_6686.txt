Copley Pharmaceutical Inc. said that it now believes the source of bacterial contamination in its Albuterol Sulfate asthma medicine was a process it used for rinsing off equipment in its packaging line.
Copley said it doesn't use the process on any of its other lines.
It has recalled its 0.5% Albuterol from the market because of the contamination.
Several lawsuits have been filed against Copley alleging that Albuterol use caused illness.
Copley said it "has received reports of deaths and illnesses claimed to be associated with the use of its product."
It added, "None of these reports have been confirmed."
