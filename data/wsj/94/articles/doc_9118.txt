Nancy J. Pedot, 42 years old, was named chief executive officer, and Stuart G. Moldaw, 66, was named chairman of this specialty retailer.
Ms. Pedot, who retains her post as Gymboree president, and Mr. Moldaw, a Gymboree director, succeed Donald S. Cohn, 49, who resigned from his posts as chairman, director and chief executive.
The moves leave a vacancy on the seven-member board.
