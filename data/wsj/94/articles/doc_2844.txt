U.S. Robotics Inc., Skokie, Ill., slashed prices on two of its modems for portable computers, sending its stock down 5%.
But a U.S. Robotics spokeswoman, describing the move as "a totally routine price reduction" that will affect only a small part of the company's product line, said the stock market was overreacting.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, the stock closed at $43, down $2.25, after being down $4.50 earlier in the day.
The price cuts were made on modems that are the size of credit cards and can slide into a slot on a portable computer, allowing the computer to be connected to a telephone line.
U.S. Robotics started shipping the older of the two modems in December.
Its price was cut 16% to $339 from $399.
The newer modem was introduced in October and isn't scheduled to be shipped until later this month.
Its price was cut 40% to $595 from $995.
