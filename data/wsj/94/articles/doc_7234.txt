The chairman of Dutch aircraft-maker Fokker NV resigned in a boardroom clash over the need for restructuring and layoffs.
Erik Jan Nederkoorn, 50 years old, quit when his plans for a third round of job cuts proved too unpopular.
His departure leaves the company without a clear strategy at a crucial time.
Mr. Nederkoorn couldn't be reached for comment.
Mr. Nederkoorn was succeeded by Vice Chairman Reinder van Duinen in a caretaker capacity.
Once famous for building fighter planes for Germany during World War I and for designing some of the world's first commercial airliners, Fokker has faced increasingly brutal competition in its field of commuter aircraft and other small planes.
The company has said it expects to post a net loss of about 150 million Dutch guilders ($76.86 million) for 1993 and at midyear in 1993 reported debt outstanding of 4.3 billion guilders.
Fokker is 51%-owned by Deutsche Aerospace AG, an arm of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG.
Fokker cut over 1,600 jobs in two rounds of layoffs last year, and Mr. Nederkoorn had been planning a third wave of firings.
"It's not clear yet what will happen" to the layoff plans, said a spokeswoman at the company, which currently employs around 9,800 people.
Fokker's boardroom has been hit by successive resignations over the past few years.
Mr. Nederkoorn's efforts to sell Fokker to Deutsche Aerospace -- a deal that went through in early 1993 -- stirred long-lasting resentment.
