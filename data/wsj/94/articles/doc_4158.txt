Long-distance carrier US Wats Inc., Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said it signed a contract with GE Capital Communication Services Corp. that will significantly expand its access to major long-distance networks.
In return for the access, US Wats granted the Atlanta-based long-distance reseller the option to purchase about 1.9 million shares, or 10% of the outstanding common stock, at market.
US Wats said the new business opportunities could increase its revenue by "some multiple."
GE Capital Communication is a unit of General Electric Co.
US Wats already provides the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. long-distance network service at as much as 30% below standard AT&T rates, mainly to small and medium-sized companies.
US Wats stock rose 6% to close at $4.25, up 25 cents, in over-the-counter trading yesterday.
