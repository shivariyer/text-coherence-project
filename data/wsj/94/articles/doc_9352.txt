Bond prices surged after an inflation report calmed jittery investors.
Stock prices were mixed and the dollar fell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.68 points to 3848.63 in very heavy trading.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index edged up 0.04 to 474.17, and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.35 to 786.87, falling a fraction away from a record.
But declining oil prices propelled the Dow Jones Transportation Average to a record.
The index of 20 stocks advanced 9.22 points to 1821.51, smashing a record set three days ago.
Until yesterday, the stock market's big gains had captured investor attention.
But it was the bond market that stole the spotlight yesterday.
After rallying more than one point on news that producer prices slipped 0.1% in December, the government's 30-year bond retreated modestly late in the afternoon, finishing the day with a strong gain.
The yield on the issue slipped below the 6.20% level for the first time in a month.
Economists said that while the PPI report was in line with expectations, traders bid up bonds mainly on the recognition that the market had sold off too sharply in recent weeks.
Traders are also betting on more good inflation news today when the Labor Department releases its consumer price report for December.
Many analysts are expecting the index to show a gain of 0.1%.
"I don't think the producer price number surprised anybody but it probably gave people more confidence that the consumer price report will be relatively benign," said Don Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities.
Mr. Fine, who is looking for a rise of 0.2% in December consumer prices, said it's hard to be bearish on bonds with oil prices falling, favorable inflation data emerging, and an economy that isn't expanding too fast.
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index dropped 0.20 to 112.71.
