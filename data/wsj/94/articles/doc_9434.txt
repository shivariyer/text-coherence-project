ConAgra Inc., the nation's largest producer of microwave popcorn, is refunding several million dollars in royalty fees to competitors after losing a contentious battle over patents for the popcorn bag.
The Omaha, Neb.-based company confirmed yesterday that it has decided to abandon further appeals in the case, in which a federal appeals court in Washington this month upheld a district court ruling that a ConAgra unit had obtained patents to the bags through a pattern of fraudulent behavior.
The judge said ConAgra's Golden Valley Microwave Foods Inc. unit had filed false affidavits with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, misstated test results and unlawfully claimed another's invention as its own.
As a result, because existing technology was involved, the judge held that bags have no patent protection.
The bag in question has since become the standard in an industry that sells an estimated two billion packages of microwavable popcorn annually.
The technology at issue involves the susceptor strip inside the bag that heats it to popping temperature.
A total of five companies that ConAgra wouldn't identify will share what a ConAgra attorney said is between $3 million and $4 million in royalties, accumulated over the years at a rate of a penny a bag.
The money has been in escrow since July 1992, when the district court's ruling came down.
ConAgra had acquired Golden Valley the previous year for nearly $500 million in stock, in part to tap its popcorn bag royalties, securities analysts said at the time.
Golden Valley sells microwave popcorn under the Act II label; another ConAgra unit makes Orville Redenbacher popcorn, the top-selling brand that in the 52 weeks ended last Dec. 5 held a 37.9% share of the $512 million business, according to Information Resources Inc.'s InfoScan service.
Although it decided against taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, ConAgra again denounced the original court ruling as having "a chilling effect on the American inventive process."
The company said the ruling serves to "discourage entrepreneurs from using the patent process to protect the fruits of their innovations, and puts American companies at a competitive disadvantage to others who copy their inventions."
There is an added sting to the case in that a senior ConAgra executive was among those at Golden Valley who had claimed the bag invention as his own.
The man, James D. Watkins, who had founded Golden Valley, now oversees ConAgra Diversified Products Cos., which includes Edina, Minn.-based Golden Valley, and is a member of ConAgra's office of the president.
"We continue to innovate and have two pending patent applications" in the microwavable popcorn bag area, said Richard J. Moen, a ConAgra attorney.
Richard D. Harris, a Chicago attorney for one defendant in the case, Weaver Popcorn Co. of Van Buren, Ind., said his client was "very gratified" that the original court decision was upheld.
Under terms of the case, neither Weaver nor co-defendant American Packaging Corp., Philadelphia, was required to pay bag royalties to Golden Valley.
