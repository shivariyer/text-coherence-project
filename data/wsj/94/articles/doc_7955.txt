Time Warner Inc.'s chief executive officer, Gerald Levin, said it doesn't intend at present to add a representative to its board from Seagram Co., which last week raised its Time Warner stake to 11.7% from 10.4%.
Mr. Levin said at a news conference that Seagram "hasn't asked to join, and we haven't invited them."
Mr. Levin was the keynote speaker at the National Association of Television Program Executives conference here.
There has been speculation on Wall Street that Time Warner is under pressure to add one or more Seagram's members to its board.
But Mr. Levin said that in the last year, Time Warner has reduced the size of its board to 15 from 24, and will likely cut it further to 10 to 12 members.
"Our program and plan is to continue to probably reduce the size of that board and not increase it," he said.
Seagram has maintained that its investment in Time Warner is friendly to management, and Mr. Levin said: "We certainly take them at their word."
But the day after Seagram increased its stake, Time Warner announced a new "posion-pill" plan that effectively limits an outside investor's ownership to 15%.
Seagram, which has said it will buy as much as to 15%, criticized the move.
Separately, a holder suit charging that Time Warner directors and officers breached their fiduciary duty by adopting "entrenchment measures" with the poison pill was filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court.
Time Warner said it feels there's no basis for the suit.
