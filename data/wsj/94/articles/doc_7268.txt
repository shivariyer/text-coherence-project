The Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 to clear Infinity Broadcasting Corp.'s purchase of a Los Angeles radio station, according to Commissioner James H. Quello, who had tried to block the transfer because of repeated complaints of indecency against Infinity radio host Howard Stern.
The FCC is expected to announce the action today, along with a $400,000 fine against Infinity for six alleged indecency violations by Mr. Stern.
Infinity is already contesting more than $1 million in FCC fines stemming from Mr. Stern's show.
Infinity is buying KRTH-FM in Los Angeles from Beasley Broadcast Group of Naples, Fla., for $110 million.
It is still seeking FCC clearance for its purchase of Washington stations WPGC AM/FM from Cook Inlet Radio Partners for about $60 million.
Infinity had sought FCC clearance of the deals before Jan. 1, but the commissioners delayed, saying they needed a thorough review of Mr. Stern's on-air record.
Infinity has been dueling with the FCC for years over Mr. Stern's show, of which Mr. Quello has been an outspoken critic.
