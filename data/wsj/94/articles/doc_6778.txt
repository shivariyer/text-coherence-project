RIO ALGOM Ltd. said it plans to raise gross proceeds of 180 million Canadian dollars (US$135.3 million) through an issuance of shares and share-purchase warrants.
The units aren't registered for sale in the U.S.
The Toronto mining company said it has agreed with underwiters to sell eight million units at C$22.50 each.
Each unit will comprise one common share and one half of a warrant.
Each full warrant will entitle the holder, within two years, to buy one common share for C$25. Rio Algom currently has about 43.7 million shares outstanding.
They closed yesterday at C$22.125, down 50 Canadian cents, in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The agreement with the underwriters is subject to regulatory approval.
Proceeds will be used to redeem C$21.5 million of preferred shares and for general corporate purposes, including the possible expansion of the Cerro Colorado mine in Chile.
