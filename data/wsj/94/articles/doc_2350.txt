Sprint Corp., the nation's third-largest long-distance company, plans to invest $350 million during the next three years to install an advanced form of fiber-optic transmission equipment in its 23,000-mile network.
Sprint said the improvement would assure its customers uninterrupted service when lines are damaged and give them an ability to send video and data traffic over its network at speeds two times faster than currently available.
The Kansas City-based company said the new technology will rely on an advanced form of a fiber-optics transmission called SONET, or Synchronous Optical Network.
It will be installed in each of Sprint's 338 locations where the long-distance network connects with local telephone companies.
The company described the new technology as an innovation in the electronics that provide light pulses for fiber optics -- thin strands of glass, for carrying voice, video or data information.
