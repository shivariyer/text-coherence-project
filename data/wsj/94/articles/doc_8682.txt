Kerr-McGee Corp. said it expects break-even results for the fourth quarter, compared with a year-ago loss of $102 million, or $2.12 a share, after charges.
For the year, the Oklahoma City energy and chemical concern expects to report net income of $75 million to $80 million, compared with year-ago loss of $100.5 million, which included $204.5 million in charges.
Kerr-McGee said its lower year-end profits were due to depressed oil prices and higher exploration expenses.
