Jamesway Corp. said sales for the four weeks ended Jan. 29 fell nearly 16%, to $25 million from $29.6 million, while same-store sales fell 5%.
The discount department-store chain, which operates stores in seven mid-Atlantic states, said the reduction in sales reflects severe weather and the decline in stores to 94 this year from 108 a year ago.
Sales for the 52 weeks ended Jan. 29 fell 16% to $722.2 million from $856 million, while same-store sales fell 8%.
