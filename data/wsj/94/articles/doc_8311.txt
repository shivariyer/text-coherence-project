Sony Corp. said it will reorganize its corporate structure, aiming to decentralize its operations and reduce layers of management.
Sony officials said the move won't lead to employment cuts or factory closings.
The changes are limited to parent-company operations, and won't affect overseas units such as Sony Corp. of America, which heads the company's movie studio and music operations in the U.S.
The Japanese consumer-electronics concern said it will regroup its various product and marketing groups into three "group" companies and five "division" companies.
The new companies will be responsible for such areas as consumer audiovisual products, components, recording media and batteries, broadcast products, systems business, personal information and communications, mobile electronics and semiconductors.
The company said the new structure would improve coordination of marketing and manufacturing efforts and allow each of the new companies greater autonomy.
