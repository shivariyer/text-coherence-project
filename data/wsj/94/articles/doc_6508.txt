Judging from several irate letters I have received in reaction to my Jan. 10 Letter to the Editor, some have misunderstood my statement that Alfred Russel Wallace rejected natural selection for the origin of man to mean that he rejected it as a general explanation of evolution.
This impression may have been influenced by your headline "Originator Recanted on Natural Selection" and the assumption that if something is true for man it must be true for all organisms.
Wallace remained firm in his support of his general theory until his death in 1913.
His departure from this view for man may have cost him dearly in accreditation (Darwin accused him of "murdering our baby"), but he was not one to be greatly concerned.
The real issue, of course, is whether competent scientists retain the right to teach a course when their analysis of the facts leads them to depart from the conventional interpretation.
The facts, after all, are primary, and the theories in such areas as evolution usually turn out to be way stations at best and mere consensual devices at worst.
