Lukens Inc. reported a net loss of $7.8 million, or 57 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 25, 1993, reflecting several restructuring charges.
A year earlier, the Coatesville, Pa., steel-plate maker had net income of $8.5 million, or 55 cents a share.
Lukens said the loss reflects $20.5 million in pretax provisions for work-force reductions, valuation of discontinued operations and other charges.
The charges taken in the current quarter reduced the earnings per-share amount by 85 cents, Lukens said.
Fiscal fourth-quarter sales decreased slightly to $202.7 million from $204.8 million the year before.
For all of fiscal 1993, Lukens reported a net loss of $50 million, or $3.51 a share, reflecting adoption of several accounting changes related to retiree medical and life-insurance benefits and accounting for income taxes.
In fiscal 1992, Lukens earned $33.1 million, or $2.31 a share.
Fiscal 1993 sales totaled $862.1 million, up from $695.8 million the year before.
