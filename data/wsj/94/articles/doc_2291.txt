Paul D. Levine, president of Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc.'s 514-store flagship Merry-Go-Round clothing chain, resigned his position, effective March 4, the company confirmed.
Mr. Levine's resignation was the latest in a management shake-up that began shortly before the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors in January.
The shake-up has included the firing in December of Stuart M. Lucas, who had been president of the company's 814-store Menz division.
In recent months, after the company dismissed several merchandising executives, Leonard Weinglass, founder and chairman, returned to take over merchandising operations and to assume the additional title of chief executive officer.
Merry-Go-Round Enterprises' president, Michael D. Sullivan, confirmed Mr. Levine's departure, which the company attributed to "personal reasons."
Mr. Levine couldn't be reached for comment.
Separately, a Merry-Go-Round spokesman said the company has indicated that it will not be able to begin formulating a reorganization plan until at least October, when the company can judge its success during the back-to-school selling period of August and September.
That will be the first real test of the company's new merchandising efforts.
The company is still looking for a chief merchant who would eventually succeed Mr. Weinglass.
The company operates 1,419 stores in 44 states that sell contemporary fashions to young men and women.
