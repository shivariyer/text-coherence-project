Labor unions will resume contributions to the Democratic National Committee after a five-month hiatus caused by the dispute over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Organized labor has given $2 million to $3 million annually to the committee in the past several years.
But after the Clinton administration pressed for -- and won -- passage of Nafta, unions halted their payouts.
Now, following a string of meetings between DNC Chairman David Wilhelm and labor leaders, unions will again open the spigot, in time for the 1994 elections.
Those elections are expected to be difficult for Democrats, who have had a higher-than-usual number of resignations in the House and Senate.
Mr. Wilhelm and officials of the AFL-CIO said that, in exchange for resuming the flow of money, unions will have a stronger advisory panel to the DNC.
AFL-CIO officials also said the DNC agreed that no member who voted against Nafta (and in support of the unions) would be "blackballed."
