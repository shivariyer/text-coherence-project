Commerce, Calif., has a message for America's small cities: Lock your car doors.
In the latest vehicle-theft statistics, Commerce, population 12,585, managed to top Detroit, New York and Los Angeles in vehicle-theft rate.
This reflects a curious trend: Car thefts are declining in big cities while rising in smaller places.
The increase is particularly notable in medium-sized cities with populations between 100,000 and 200,000.
The figures come from a study by the National Insurance Crime Bureau that measure 1992 statistics, as reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, against those of 1991.
According to the insurance crime bureau, Commerce had 636 vehicle thefts in 1992.
That's the equivalent of 5,053 car thefts for each 100,000 residents.
(Even that is an improvement over the 1991 rate of 5,449 thefts per 100,000 inhabitants.)
Nationwide, according to the bureau, the bottom line for 1992 was that vehicle thefts declined 3.1% from 1991 -- the first decrease in total thefts in nine years.
Still, despite the good news, the bureau notes, vehicle theft remains a serious problem in the U.S., where a theft occurs once every 20 seconds.
In 1992, 1,610,834 vehicles were stolen, with an estimated total value of nearly $7.6 billion.
The insurance crime bureau credits the drop in big-city thefts to a significant increase in the use of antitheft devices and more cautious car owners.
In smaller cities, though, it's a different story.
"Vehicle theft in smaller cities and suburban communities hasn't been perceived as a large problem in the past, and there's an attitude that it can't happen to me," says Steve Cindrich, a bureau spokesman.
A poll by the Gallup Organization revealed that 14% of those surveyed don't always remove their ignition keys when leaving a vehicle unattended.
And 31% said they don't always lock their vehicle doors.
"That is an open invitation for a thief to take the vehicle," Mr. Cindrich says.
Places like Commerce, though, have another explanation for their rising cartheft problems: nearby big cities.
"We're surrounded by densely populated cities, and a lot of their residents come in to work in Commerce," says Sgt. Michael Herek of the East Los Angeles sheriff's department, which provides police services under contract for Commerce.
Like Commerce, the six other small cities that ranked in the top 10 for vehicle theft rates are located next to major urban centers.
Only three cities with populations over 100,000 ranked in the top 10: Newark, N.J. (No. 2), Fresno, Calif.
(No. 5) and Bridgeport, Conn.
(No. 10).
In Commerce, Sgt. Herek says that over the past year the department has taken aggressive steps to curtail vehicle thefts.
Cable TV programs encourage residents to lock their vehicle doors and buy antitheft devices, and businesses have increased lighting and hired security in high vehicle-theft areas.
Harvey, Ill., with a population of 30,292, ranked third with 4,350 vehicle thefts per 100,000 inhabitants, down 17% from 5,229 in 1991.
The Harvey police believes the town is getting a bum rap.
Harvey Police Sgt. Lawrence Patterson says about 45% of the city's vehicle thefts are drug-related.
Drug users rent their vehicles to drug dealers in exchange for cocaine.
If the vehicles aren't returned, the owners report them stolen, he says.
"We know who the players are, but our manpower shortage is a problem," Sgt. Patterson says.
"We don't have a stolen-auto division in the department."
Harvey has also experienced a surge in homicides and other violent crimes, which has left the department with even fewer resources to track car thieves.
