Johnson & Johnson said fourth-quarter net income rose 9.1% mainly through cost-cutting and productivity gains.
Net income was $335 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $307 million, or 47 cents a share, a year ago.
Sales for the quarter were $3.53 billion, up slightly from $3.5 billion a year earlier.
The health-care company, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., said without the negative impact of currency translation, world-wide sales would have grown by 7%.
Johnson & Johnson said it will keep looking for ways to "re-engineer" the company and said it sees much of its future growth in such developing markets as Eastern Europe and China.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Johnson & Johnson stock closed at $42.125, down 25 cents.
For the full year, net income rose 74% to $1.79 billion, or $2.74 a share, from $1.03 billion, or $1.56 a share.
The 1992 results included a $595 million charge for accounting changes.
Sales for the year edged up 2.8% to $14.14 billion.
