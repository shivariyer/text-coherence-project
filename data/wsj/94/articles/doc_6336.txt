Sony Electronics Inc. said it will introduce a device that will, among others things, allow motorists to find directions without having to ask at a gas station.
The electronics concern in Park Ridge, N.J., said the device, which uses satellite positioning technology, will contain maps and other travel information that can be displayed on a five-inch color screen.
Using a satellite network, the device can pinpoint a driver's location, and show that location in relation to the person's intended destination, Sony said.
Sony Electronics, a unit of Japan's Sony Corp., plans to introduce the device in California and parts of Nevada in the second half of 1994.
Similar devices have been available in Japan for about two years, a Sony spokesman said, and sell for about $2,500.
Prices for the planned U.S. versions haven't been decided, he said.
Other companies, including Trimble Navigation Ltd., offer such systems, with differing capabilities.
