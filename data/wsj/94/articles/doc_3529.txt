Small-company stocks narrowed a steep early loss, but prices never pulled into positive territory as market players ran first to big cyclicals.
Sharp swings in the bond market created extreme volatility among equities.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 50 points this morning, triggering the "uptick rule," which restricts program trading.
By the close, the blue-chip barometer had advanced nearly 23 points.
Smaller stocks weren't quite as lucky but managed to overcome part of the early bloodletting.
The Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks finished 1.54, or 0.58%, lower at 262.80.
The Nasdaq Stock Market's Composite Index fell 5.17, or 0.66%, to 783.47.
When the long bond plunged a full point in early trading, the Russell sank to a low of 259.48.
The Nasdaq Composite slid to 771.88 at its worst level.

Big Board-traded Horizon Healthcare, an Albuquerque, N.M., operator of healthcare facilities, slipped 1 1/4 to 22 1/2 after Alex. Brown & Sons analyst Deborah Lawson cut her rating to "buy" from "strong buy."
The company's stock price also fell Tuesday, apparently on news that analysts received a mailing from a company union containing a Massachusetts Department of Public Health report outlining a restrictive agreement the company reached with Horizon in order to receive nursing-home licenses in Massachusetts.
Among gainers, an initial "buy" rating from Wertheim Schroder analyst Alfred V. Tobia Jr. sent Broadway & Seymour up 1 to 12 3/4.

Alfred E. Goldman, director of technical research at A.G. Edwards & Sons, said, "The blue chips had a selling climax this morning and saw their peak downside."
"We've been bearish for a month in a bullish market, and when the market lifts, where do people have the courage to put their money-into big name, big cyclicals," Mr. Goldman said.
The bond market recovered based on a "growing realization that inflation isn't going to come raging back," Mr. Goldman added.
"When cooler heads prevail, people will realize that the move by the Federal Reserve on Feb. 4 was a positive, preemptive strike.
We can step on the brakes lightly now, or jam on the brakes in six months."
