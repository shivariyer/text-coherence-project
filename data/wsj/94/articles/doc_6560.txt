Gymboree Corp. said January sales rose 42% to $8.8 million from $6.2 million a year ago.
Sales at stores open for at least a year rose 7% during the period.
The children's-wear chain said the Los Angeles earthquake affected 13 of its stores, with three still closed.
Excluding the 13 stores for the two weeks following the earthquake, January sales for the 152-store chain rose 45% and same-store sales were up 10%, Gymboree said.
