ABC Sports will announce today a five-year contract to televise the Big Eight Conference's college football games.
The deal, running from 1996 to 2000 and valued at close to $60 million, culminates a series of transactions in which ABC and CBS Inc., both based in New York, have snapped up football TV rights from the major athletic conferences.
The Big Eight includes such perennial football powers as the University of Nebraska and the University of Oklahoma.
The conference recently added four former Southwest Conference schools in Texas, expanding its geographic base and TV desirability.
"This is a terrific complement to what we already had," said a spokesman for ABC, a Capital Cities/ABC Inc. unit.
Liberty Sports, a unit of Liberty Media Corp., will get the cable-TV portion of the Big Eight package for an estimated $40 million.
