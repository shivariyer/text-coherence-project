Landmark Graphics Corp., Houston, said it will record a cash charge of about $2 million, or 15 cents a share, and may record an additional noncash charge of $10 million, or 74 cents a share, in its fiscal third quarter ending Thursday .
The oil-exploration-services company said the $2 million charge is for costs associated with its acquisition of Advance Geophysical Corp. of Denver.
Landmark requested a ruling from the Securities and Exchange Commission on whether it must record the $10 million charge associated with its new unit's compensation plans.
For the year-earlier quarter, Landmark had net income of $1.9 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $23.6 million.
The spokesman said analysts predicted earnings of 25 cents a share to 27 cents a share on revenue of $30 million for the current quarter.
Samuel Rutt Bridges was named a director of Landmark and president and chief executive officer of its Advance Geophysical unit.
Mr. Bridges, 43, was chairman and director of research for Advance Geophysical.
His board appointment increases membership to seven.
