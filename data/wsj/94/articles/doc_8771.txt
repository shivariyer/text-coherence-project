CORNING Inc., Corning, N.Y., said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer eight million common shares, up from 6.7 million the company originally planned.
Corning, which has businesses in specialty materials, consumer housewares, telecommunications and laboratory sciences, said it decided to increase the offering's size after "an assessment of market conditions."
Corning will use proceeds from the offering to finance its $108.5 million part of the purchase of Northern Telecom Ltd.'s optical fiber and cable businesses.
The total purchase price is $130 million, but Corning is buying the businesses with its Siecor joint venture.
Siemens Corp., the joint venture partner and a unit of Siemens AG, will pay the remainder.
Corning also will use money from the offering to pay $131 million for ending a joint venture with Vitro SA of Mexico.
Goldman, Sachs and Co. is the lead underwriter.
