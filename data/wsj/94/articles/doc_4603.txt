Phar-Mor Inc. said in a court filing that it wants to meet with a court-appointed examiner to discuss the possibility of recovering money from former executives and directors.
The retailer, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992 after alleging it was the target of a fraud and embezzlement scheme by former executives, said that based on a report by examiner Jay Alix, it has concluded that "certain transactions appear to give rise to causes of action against persons or entities that are financially responsible."
The deep-discount retailer said it hopes to meet with Mr. Alix and his staff to discuss their findings, database and any relevant evidence they uncovered during their investigation.
On March 1, Phar-Mor management will meet with creditors to discuss, among other things, court actions to recover the money.
A Phar-Mor spokesman wouldn't elaborate on specific transactions under study.
Earlier this month, Stuart Hertzberg, an attorney for the unsecured creditors' committee, said he would consult with other creditors and Phar-Mor management about trying to recover about $75 million that several directors and shareholders received in a 1991 stock buyback.
Mr. Hertzberg also said there may be profits to recover from shareholders, including Phar-Mor Chairman David Shapira and several directors, on stock-option transactions that the examiner's report said occurred after the options expired.
Mr. Shapira has said the board was told by its outside accountants and attorneys that it was proper to exercise the options after they had expired.
