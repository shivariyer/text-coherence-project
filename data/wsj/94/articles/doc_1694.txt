Sphinx Pharmaceuticals Corp. said it has been sued by several shareholders over the company's planned acquisition by Eli Lilly & Co.
Eli Lilly has tentatively agreed to acquire Sphinx for $6 a share, a price that values the biotech concern at about $80 million.
Yesterday, Sphinx said the lawsuits, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, seek to halt the acquisition.
The company said the lawsuits allege that certain Sphinx officers, among others, breached their fiduciary duties.
Sphinx, Durham, N.C., said it believes management "fully satisfied" its responsibilities, that the acquisition is in the best interests of shareholders, and that it intends to vigorously defend against the lawsuits.
