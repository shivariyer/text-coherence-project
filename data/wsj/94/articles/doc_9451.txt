The Clinton health-care reform was initially delivered to the press on floppy disk.
One of the originators of managed health care, economist Alain Enthoven, seems to be suggesting that those disks be reformatted.
In a speech yesterday on the Clinton health-care proposal, he said, "Price controls don't and won't work and therefore the first thing Congress should do is delete pages one through 1,342 of Clinton's 1,342-page bill."
Prof. Enthoven also thinks the plan's intended goals of holding down the rise in health costs to 1.5% by 1996 and eventually zero is also weak: "These are goals that have not been seen in the free world in the history of health care."
It sounds to us as if it's time for the ambitious proposal's builders to see that this model isn't going to fly.
