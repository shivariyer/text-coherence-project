HarperCollins Publishers, a unit of News Corp., said William M. Shinker resigned as head of the company's adult consumer division.
Mr. Shinker, 46 years old, said he has no career plans following his Feb. 18 departure.
HarperCollins named Jack McKeown, 41 , who joined the publisher a year ago as Mr. Shinker's deputy, to publisher of adult consumer books.
Mr. Shinker's resignation comes as a shock, because HarperCollins just completed one of its most successful years ever-publishing an impressive string of bestsellers.
Mr. Shinker is widely considered a very savvy publisher, and he has spent a decade building up the adult division.
Some publishing insiders say Mr. Shinker lately has been clashing with George Craig, HarperCollins's chief executive officer, over how much was spent acquiring new books and how accounting for them has been handled.
Reached at his office, Mr. Shinker said, "I know this is a shock to other people, but I can't talk about the reasons and I don't want to."
Mr. Shinker's wife, Susan Moldow, will remain editor in chief of the adult consumer division.
