Time Inc., the publishing arm of Time Warner Inc., said it will soon switch to using recycled paper in all its magazines, adding a new twist to a continuing tussle between publishers and environmentalists.
Time magazine, the company's flagship, will make the changeover by early summer, along with People and Sports Illustrated.
By 1996, the company said, most of the 250,000 tons of paper it uses in its 36 magazines will be recycled stock.
Time magazine is announcing the change in its issue today, which includes a publisher's note explaining how the company formerly couldn't get enough recycled paper to even consider the move.
Magazine publishers have come under heavy pressure from environmental groups concerned about the huge amounts of paper they use, as well as the pollution generated by the paper-making process.
Paper that incorporates a percentage of recycled material is considered easier on the environment.
"Once an industry leader like Time does this, it creates pressure for others to follow," says John Ruston, an economic analyst at the Environmental Defense Fund in New York.
While Time polishes its environmental image, the company acknowledges that its recycled paper is far from the ultimate solution.
The company says it will continue working with producers to cut pollution generated by paper making.
Meanwhile, the recycled component of Time's new paper will be only about 10% of the total.
Since magazine paper has to be extremely thin, yet strong enough to run through printing presses at race-car speeds, it still needs to include mostly virgin pulp.
New pulp is stronger than recycled material and also makes smoother surfaces.
