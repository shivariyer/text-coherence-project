Ohio Casualty Corp. said its fourth-quarter profit was reduced by about 62 cents a share because of a $17.2 million contingent liability for the company's share of the New Jersey Market Transition Facility operating losses.
Ohio earned $32.1 million, or $1.79 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
The MTF recorded net losses of about $400 million in both 1991 and 1992.
Ohio Casualty had an approximate 2% market share for the assessment period.
The first payment is due in February 1994 to cover 1991 MTF operating losses and the second payment will be due in February 1995 to cover 1992 MTF operating losses.
The MTF was established in October 1990 to replace the New Jersey Joint Underwriting Association in providing automobile insurance policies for individuals who couldn't obtain insurance elsewhere.
