In France's biggest legal shakeup in nearly two centuries, a new penal code took effect Tuesday that takes into account modern ills.
Two decades in the making, the new code is the most extensive overhaul yet of the legal guidelines set down by Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte in 1810.
Its 650 articles in four volumes generally toughen jail terms.
For the first time, it makes companies and nonprofit groups accountable for endangering others.
The code has provisions for terrorism, environmental terrorism -- including willful pollution -- vandalism, computer fraud and child pornography.
The new code also provides for alternative forms of punishment such as property seizure or community service.
Not everyone thinks the new law is a step forward.
The Reseau Voltaire, a group advocating freedom of expression, criticized an article that prohibits the manufacture, transport, distribution or diffusion of violent or pornographic material that could be seen by minors.
The group says the new "law hinders sexual education and AIDS prevention campaigns, and marks the return of tight censorship."
