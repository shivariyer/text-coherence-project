Apple Computer Inc. introduced a digital color camera that can take pictures and download them directly to Apple computers or any computer that runs Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.
Previous electronic cameras, such as Canon USA Inc.'s Xapshot, have flopped in the marketplace, mostly because the pictures were too fuzzy and the cameras and equipment to hook them up to computers cost roughly $1,000.
At a list price of $750, Apple's QuickTake camera isn't inexpensive, but will likely sell for much less on the street.
Also, while its pictures aren't as crisp as regular 35mm photographs, they are "perfect" for reproduction in newspapers, or for use in mock-up copies of publications, an Apple spokeswoman said.
Separately, Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., introduced a $630 color inkjet printer with a print quality of 360 dots per inch, compared with the standard 300 dpi.
The printer is scheduled to be shipped in late March.
