World Airways Inc. filed with the Department of Transportation seeking traffic rights to operate flights between the U.S. and South Africa.
The carrier, a unit of WorldCorp Inc., said its plans call for a marketing agreement with a major U.S. airline to provide connecting service, among other things.
World Airways said it wants to begin flying to South Africa July 1.
In its filing with the Transportation Department, World Airways estimated that its proposed service would generate a profit of $4.9 million in the first year.
