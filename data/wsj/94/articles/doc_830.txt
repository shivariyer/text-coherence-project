Jamesway Corp., which has been operating under bankruptcy-court protection since July, reported a narrower loss for its fiscal fourth quarter.
For the quarter ended Jan. 29, the Secaucus, N.J.-based retailer reported a net loss of $19.7 million, or $1.42 a share, compared with a net loss of $43.2 million, or $3.11 a share.
Revenue declined 13% to $219.1 million from $252.6 million.
The company said cost-cutting and lower expenses helped narrow the fourth-quarter loss.
The recent quarter included pretax charges of $22.3 million.
The year-earlier quarter included a pretax charge of $48.1 million, mainly related to store closings and restructuring.
Jamesway said sales declines in the fourth quarter stem from fewer stores in operations and harsh weather in its Middle Atlantic market.
It reported a 6% drop in sales at stores open more than one year.
