Rex Stores Corp. said total sales for January rose 30% to $24.9 million from $19.1 million a year ago.
Comparable-store sales rose 5% to $18.2 million from $17.3 million.
The company said total sales for the 1994 fiscal year were $289.9 million, up from $225.7 million in fiscal 1993.
Comparable-store sales for the year rose 8%, the specialty retailer of consumer electronic products and appliances said.
Comparable-store sales are those for stores open four full fiscal quarters, but the company said that from now on it will consider a store to be comparable after it has been open for six full fiscal quarters.
