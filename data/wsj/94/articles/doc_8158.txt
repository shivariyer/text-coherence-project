Sanborn Inc. filed for Chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Worcester, Mass.
The waste-management company said that effective with the filing last Friday, Stephen Gray of the recovery group was named interim chief executive.
The company, based in Wrentham, Mass., said it intends to continue its operations while under the protection of Chapter 11.
Company officials didn't return telephone calls seeking details.
In October, the company announced the resignation of George W. Sanborn, its president and chief executive, citing medical reasons.
The company also said that to address liquidity and cash-flow issues, it was holding informational discussions and due-diligence meetings with unidentified third parties interested in buying certain assets, including divisions, business units and real estate.
No definitive agreements had been reached, it said.
