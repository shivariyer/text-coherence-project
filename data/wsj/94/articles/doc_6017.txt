Toyota Motor Corp. reported a steep decline in earnings for its fiscal first half but managed to avoid posting its first operating loss in decades through some aggressive cost-cutting.
The results, battered by the strong yen and weak domestic sales, were in line with analysts' expectations.
Pretax profit skidded 49% to 83.24 billion yen ($765.4 million) in the six months ended Dec. 31, from 162.34 billion yen a year earlier.
Net income fell 46% to 39.44 billion yen, or 10.59 yen a share, from 72.34 billion yen, or 19.43 yen a share.
Sales were down 13% at 3.988 trillion yen from 4.564 trillion yen a year earlier.
The company left its dividend unchanged at nine yen a share.
The pretax and net earnings results were buoyed in part by interest income on Toyota's huge cash holdings.
Because of that, all eyes had been on the car maker's operating profit, which represents earnings on its core manufacturing businesses.
Toyota nevertheless managed to eke out an operating profit of 9.84 billion yen, down 84%, for the half.
While that is a precipitous drop, last summer, when the yen soared to a record against the dollar, some analysts predicted the company might show a loss for the first time since 1949.
Toyota said the downturn in its earnings is expected to continue in the second half, which ends June 30, amid the prolonged recession in major consuming countries.
The company's pretax profit for the full fiscal year is projected to shrink 30% from a year earlier to 200 billion yen.
Breaking down the six-month operating results, Masami Iwasaki, vice chairman, said the yen's rise against the dollar was responsible for a drop of roughly 100 billion yen, while lower sales resulted in a fall of 50 billion yen.
On the other hand, the company managed to save some 101.1 billion yen by cutting costs and reducing depreciation expenses, limiting the decrease in the operating profit.
