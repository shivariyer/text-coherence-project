Dominion Textile Inc. said its specialty yarns division will close a spinning plant in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and a dyeing plant in Montreal, resulting in 380 layoffs.
The textiles maker said it will invest five million Canadian dollars (US$3.8 million) this year to modernize its other yarn mill in Sherbrooke.
