International Business Machines Corp. said it plans to launch a more powerful version of its SP1 supercomputer, targeted at commercial customers rather than scientists or engineers.
The machine, dubbed SP2 and scheduled to be officially unveiled next month, is aimed at serving businesses with a need for massive computing power, such as securities firms, insurance companies or retailers, IBM executives said at the CeBIT computer fair here.
Like the SP1 supercomputer launched last autumn, the new model links fast RISC microprocessors in a so-called parallel-processing design.
The move fits in with IBM's strategy of developing machines based on the speedy RISC technology, known as reduced-instruction-set computing.
IBM has already sold about 80 of its SP1 supercomputers since the launch of the cabinet-sized machine in September.
Later this year, the company plans to unveil a new version of its mainstay 390-series mainframe based on the parallel-processing architecture, in which dozens of microprocessors are linked together to perform computations.
