Yields on taxable money-market funds rose in the week ended Tuesday.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compound yield on taxable funds inched up to 2.85% from 2.83%, the fifth-consecutive weekly rise, according to Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass., newsletter.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
The average seven-day simple yield on taxable funds rose to 2.81% from 2.79%, while the 30-day simple yield edged up to 2.78% from 2.75%.
The 30-day compound yield rose to 2.82% from 2.79%.
Assets of 645 taxable funds grew by $6.27 billion, to $478.93 billion, the newsletter said.
Individual investors accounted for $4.74 billion of the inflow, while institutional investors put in $1.53 billion.
Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments, which include commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and Treasury bills, shortened by two days to 51 days.
That's a 10-day drop since the beginning of February, a sign that portfolio managers expect short-term interest rates to rise.
On tax-exempt funds, the average seven-day compound yield eased to 1.95% from 1.99%, in the latest week.
The latest tax-free yield is equivalent to a taxable 3.05% for someone paying 36% in taxes and to 3.23% for those who pay 39.6%.
Assets of 346 tax-exempt funds rose by $3.44 billion, to $116.10 billion, the newsletter said.
The tax-free funds' average portfolio maturity remained at 55 days.
