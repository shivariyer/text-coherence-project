In your latest criticism of the Fish and Wildlife Service's attempts to implement the Endangered Species Act ("Death of a Sturgeon," Review & Outlook, Jan. 26), you once again made selective use of the facts to paint a misleading picture.
While it is true the fish died on Friday, Dec. 31, the service was not informed until Monday, Jan. 3.
The service then immediately made the fact public.
The sturgeon was wrapped and frozen, as was prearranged in the event the fish died.
This was necessary to prevent deterioration and to ensure that a necropsy would be possible.
The service did not suggest that the fish be preserved in formaldehyde, as you reported.
We wished to limit intrusive sample-collecting of the sturgeon's blood and tissue while it was alive to minimize trauma to the fish.
Formal requests for blood samples from the Army Corps of Engineers were not received until after the fish died.
Further, we offered the Alabama-Tombigbee Rivers Coalition an opportunity to examine and measure the fish on Jan. 5, only two days after we were notified of its death.
The limited time allowed for viewing, measuring and photographing the frozen specimen was necessary to ensure that it did not begin to thaw and deteriorate.
Additional time could have been arranged had there been a request.
The Coalition was informed that we intended to conduct a necropsy and take tissue samples for genetic testing.
Those samples will be made available to the Coalition and to other interests.
The Fish and Wildlife Service's goal is to ensure that any future decisions concerning the status of the Alabama sturgeon represent the best scientific information available.
