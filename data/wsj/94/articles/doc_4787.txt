Italy's Benetton Group SpA said it reached an agreement with Timex USA and Junghans Uhren GmbH to form a company to create, produce and distribute world-wide a line of wristwatches and clocks under the Benetton trademark.
Benetton said the line will include water-resistant quartz analog watches and chronograph watches and is expected to be launched in the fall.
Retail prices will range from $60 to $120, it said.
In the new company, Timex will be responsible for the production of quartz analog watches and the distribution of all Benetton brand watches in North America and Asia.
Junghans will manufacture all Benetton brand clocks and will handle the marketing and sales of the new company's products in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa, the Middle East, South America and New Zealand.
