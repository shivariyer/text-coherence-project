French auto maker PSA Peugeot Citroen said it plans to raise 3.96 billion French francs ($677.4 million) on the domestic capital market through the issuance of convertible bonds.
The bonds, to be issued at a nominal 990 francs, will bear a 2% annual coupon and mature on Jan. 1, 2001.
The subscription period runs today through March 14 and the bonds are convertible into shares at any time on a 1-for-1 basis.
Peugeot said it will issue four million bonds.
In the event of nonconversion, the bonds will be redeemed at 1,224 francs, making a yield to maturity of 5%.
