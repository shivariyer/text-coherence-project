Two forest-products companies, Weyerhaeuser Co. and Willamette Industries Inc., said high prices and strong demand for lumber fueled fourth-quarter results that topped analysts' expectations.
Tacoma, Wash.-based Weyerhaeuser said it earned $101.7 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $85.3 million, or 42 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Sales rose 10% to $2.59 billion.
Analysts had expected Weyerhaeuser to report per-share net of 47 cents for the quarter, according to Zacks Investment Research.
For 1993, Weyerhaeuser's net income surged 58% to $579.3 million, or $2.83 a share, from $372 million, or $1.83 a share.
Sales inched up 3% to $9.54 billion.
Results in 1993 included nonrecurring gains of $132 million, or 65 cents a share, from asset disposition and debt extinguishment plus a charge of $20 million, or 10 cents a share, for deferred taxes.
Willamette of Portland, Ore., said net income for the fourth quarter was $32.1 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with $13.2 million, or 24 cents a share, in 1992's fourth quarter.
Sales gained 10% to $658 million.
Analysts estimated Williamette would post per-share earnings of 49 cents.
For the year, Willamette earned $137 million, or $2.50 a share, including a nonrecurring accounting-related gain of $26.3 million, or 48 cents a share, and a charge of about $6 million, or 11 cents a share, for deferred taxes.
In 1992, the company had net of $81.5 million, or $1.52 a share.
Sales gained 11% to $2.62 billion.
Paper and pulp operations at both companies continued to be weak, reflecting recessionary effects of weak demand and low prices.
But demand for lumber and other building products strengthened as the nation's construction sector revived.
