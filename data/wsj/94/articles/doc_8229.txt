IVF America Inc. named Gerardo Canet, 48 years old, president and chief executive officer, effective in mid-February.
He succeeds Philippe L. Sommer, who had held both posts on an interim basis.
IVF began undergoing management changes in September when Andrew Dahl, formerly president and chief executive, left the company to pursue other interests, a spokesman said.
At that time, Mr. Sommer, managing director of Medical Ventures Holdings Inc. in New York, agreed to work part-time at IVF until a successor for Mr. Dahl was named.
Medical Ventures is a principal holder of IVF.
Mr. Canet was executive vice president of Curative Technologies Inc., East Setauket, N.Y, and president of its wound-care center division.
IVF, which provides fertility treatment, also said Edwin Snape, a managing general partner of the Vista Group in New Canaan, Conn., resigned as chairman, as he had intended when a new chief executive was named.
IVF had revenue of $11.6 million for the first nine months of 1993.
Curative Technologies said its president and chief executive, Russell B. Whitman, will assume Mr. Canet's duties.
The company added that it had no immediate plans to name a successor.
