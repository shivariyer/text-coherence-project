The Federal Housing Finance Board announced a novel transaction between the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and the state of California designed to provide discounted financing for earthquake-relief lending in Southern California.
California will purchase a $145 million bond issue of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and the San Francisco Federal Home Loan Bank will lend the bond proceeds to local financial institutions to promote mortgage and commercial lending for low-income and moderate-income households and neighborhoods in areas affected by the Jan. 17 earthquake.
California Treasurer Kathleen Brown said the initiative "makes financial resources available so people can get the low-interest loans needed to buy new homes, repair existing ones or rebuild their businesses."
The $145 million will be made available through five lenders: American Savings Bank, Stockton; Coast Federal Bank, Los Angeles, a unit of Coast Savings Financial Inc.; First Republic Thrift & Loan, San Francisco, a unit of First Republic Bancorp Inc.; Glendale Federal Bank, Glendale; and Home Savings of America, Irwindale, a unit of H.F. Ahmanson & Co.
