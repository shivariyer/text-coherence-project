Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its debt rating on $50 million of this heating-oil distributor's subordinated notes due 2003 to single-B-2 from single-B-1.
Moody's said the action reflects the company's increased debt and its substantial increase in subordinated debt.
The company, it noted, has a leading position in the home heating-oil industry.
The company declined comment.
