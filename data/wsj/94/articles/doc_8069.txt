In a turnaround from a year ago, a majority of small and medium-size businesses in the New York metropolitan area expect higher sales and profits this year, and more than a third said they will hire new permanent workers should business improve, according to a survey by consulting firm Arthur Andersen.
More than 66% of 305 executives polled just before the year end expect a sales increase this year compared with 39% in a year-end 1992 survey.
Fifty-nine percent see higher profits compared with 34% in 1992.
More than 43% of the respondents said they plan to expand their permanent work forces if business improves.
Another 25% said they will hire additional temporary workers, while slightly more than 23% said they will increase the overtime work of their current employees.
In the 1992 survey, only 21% indicated they would increase their permanent hires, with others saying they would do more with fewer people.
