Lomas Financial Corp. said it plans to cut its work force by 180 people, or 7.8%, by the end of the month as part of a cost-cutting move.
The Dallas mortgage-servicing concern said the cuts will result in a charge of about $5 million for the fiscal second quarter, ended Dec. 31, 1993.
Lomas had net income of $3.3 million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Lomas said the job cuts, primarily in Dallas, will save the company $8 million a year in operating expenses.
Lomas has 2,300 employees.
