Ethyl Corp. said fourth-quarter net income slumped 91%, mainly because of the effects of spinning off insurance businesses.
The Richmond, Va., company said operating earnings from continuing operations rose 4.3%, amid improved results in its chemicals and petroleum additives businesses.
Fourth-quarter net income fell to $7.9 million, or seven cents a share, from $83.4 million, or 70 cents a share.
The 1993 quarter included a $10 million charge for downsizing operations and retirement of debt.
The year-earlier quarter included $42 million in operating earnings from discontinued insurance businesses and a gain of $24.2 million, or 20 cents a share, on the sale of a 20% investment in First Colony Corp., a life insurer spun off in 1993.
