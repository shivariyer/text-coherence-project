Central & South West Corp. said it will reduce its work force by about 750 full-time employees and 100 full-time contract professionals, or 10% of the company's total work force.
The cuts, to be completed this year, are part of a corporate restructuring announced by the public utility company in November.
Central & South West is also offering early retirement to 726 employees.
