Integrated Resources Inc. signed a preliminary agreement that could hasten Steinhardt Management Co.'s efforts to gain control of the former tax-shelter company.
Integrated, one of the largest syndicators of limited partnerships in the 1980s, has been operating with protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code for four years.
Closely held Steinhardt, an affiliate of a New York-based hedge fund run by Michael Steinhardt, has been seeking to acquire Integrated for two years.
Integrated said it signed a nonbinding "term sheet" with three creditor committees and Steinhardt.
Under the term-sheet agreement, creditors will get to vote on the Steinhardt plan, while a proposed plan filed by Integrated will be treated solely as a backup plan.
According to a spokeswoman for Integrated, the term sheet must still be converted into a definitive agreement and filed with the bankruptcy court.
A judge is expected to consider the alternative plans at an April 22 hearing.
