Thomas Sowell, Hoover Institution fellow, in the Nov. 19 New York Post:
What the welfare state is saying, whether in this new "Health Security Act" or in a thousand other programs, is that we are not to be a nation of independent people controlling our own lives, but a nation of clients whose lives are controlled by bureaucrats, dispensing taxpayers' money according to the vision of the anointed.
This is not a new idea, however much the advocates of the welfare state proclaim "change."
Most of the history of the human race has been a history of the masses of ordinary people having their lives controlled and their destiny decided by some elite.
It has taken centuries of struggle, agony, sacrifice and bloodshed to get out from under the thumb of those who acted as if they had been born into this world "booted and spurred, to ride mankind."
Now we are turning around and heading backward, toward a world where people's fates are not in their own hands but in the hands of some puffed-up political "leaders."
