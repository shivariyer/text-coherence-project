Triton Energy Corp., Dallas, said a production-sharing contract that it has reached with concerns in Malaysia and Thailand has been submitted to the governments of those countries for approval.
The agreements that a Triton unit has with the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority and a subsidiary of Petronas, the Malaysian state oil company, cover petroleum operations in Block A-18, about 700,000 acres located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Thailand.
The Petronas unit and Triton each hold a 50% interest in Block A-18.
Under the production-sharing agreement, the two energy concerns would form a joint operating company to serve as operator.
Triton said it expects operations to begin in June with the acquisition of seismic data, followed by exploration and appraisal drilling.
