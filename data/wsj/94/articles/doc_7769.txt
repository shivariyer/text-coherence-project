Paging Network Inc. expects to post today a 45% jump in operating cash flow for the fourth quarter to about $29 million from $20 million a year earlier.
In an interview, the paging company's president, Terry L. Scott, said Paging Network expects to report that revenue increased 34% in the period to $85 million from $63.3 million a year ago.
The company, like most other paging concerns, views operating cash flow -- earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization -- as its key performance measure because of heavy up-front marketing expenses.
Mr. Scott said the company, which is based in Plano, Texas, expects to report a net loss for the quarter of $4.7 million, or nine cents a share, compared with a loss of $4.2 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier.
He said the company closed the year with 3,070,000 pagers in service, up sharply from 2,077,954 at the end of 1992.
