I am writing to correct the inference in Marcy Mason's March 14 Manager's Journal "The Curse of Whistle-Blowing" that International Paper's compliance hotline encourages unfounded accusations or fails to protect employees by providing adequate confidentiality.
In fact, our hotline operates through an independent outside company -- suggested in the Manager's Journal as "the best way" to ensure confidential treatment to employees making allegations -- and investigations are handled by a professionally trained company audit staff.
The objective is to fix problems, not to fix blame.
As also noted in your article, "most of the premier ethics programs at U.S. corporations have similar hotline reporting systems."
International Paper is proud that it is in the forefront of industry efforts to prevent and detect violations and comply with all laws and regulations governing our operations.
