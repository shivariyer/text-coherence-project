A firebrand Indian lawmaker threatened Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. with picket lines in front of bottling plants and retailers unless the two beverage companies quit the country by the end of February.
At a news conference Friday, Parliament member George Fernandes called the companies "the advance guard of American capitalism in its design to take over the world."
When he was industry minister in 1977, Mr. Fernandes threw Coca-Cola out of India when it refused to relinquish 60% of its stock to local investors or disclose its secret formula.
Now, however, his party doesn't control the government, and the current government favors foreign investment.
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola returned to India in October, buying out India's largest soft-drink producer.
Pepsi came here in 1992 after the government began opening its sheltered economy.
The threats didn't seem to bother the two beverage companies.
"We will carry on with our business.
We are here with the permission of the government of India," said P.M. Sinha, managing director of Pepsi's India operations, adding: "Such demonstrations won't affect our sales.
They have tried similar things against Nestle and Unilever, and it hasn't worked."
