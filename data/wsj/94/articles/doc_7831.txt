Private contractors seeking business with the federal government, under a pilot program to be unveiled today, will be required to show how well they have performed on their previous federal contracts.
Representatives of 19 federal agencies -- including the Treasury, Agriculture, Energy, Transportation and Justice departments, the Air Force, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -- will today sign a pledge to make "past performance" a major criterion for evaluating a private company's fitness for government work.
The pledge follows through on a call for greater flexibility in federal procurement, which was included in Vice President Al Gore's "reinventing government" report last summer.
The program will apply only to certain contracts, representing roughly $2 billion in federal spending undertaken by the participating agencies.
Although some federal agencies -- most notably the Defense Department -- have used variations on the past-performance standard before, federal agencies generally have been loath to consider past performance in awarding contracts.
Federal officials avoid the issue because it is thought to be too subjective a criterion, compared with more-objective considerations such as which company is the lowest bidder, or which company's proposal meets certain technical specifications.
The agencies that sign today's agreement will meet in coming weeks to establish guidelines on how to implement the past-performance standard.
Among the factors that the federal government, under the new procedure, would consider in granting contracts are whether a company has a record of delivering products or services on time, and how frequently the company has sought price adjustments on federal contracts because of unforeseen circumstances.
