SPI Holding Inc., Richardson, Texas, said its Spectradyne unit agreed to transfer its manufacturing operations to Cerplex Group Inc. of Anaheim, Calif.
Spectradyne provides pay-per-view movies and other programming to hotel rooms.
Its manufacturing operations produce the equipment that allows the hotels to receive the programming.
Under the accord, Cerplex, a closely held electronics concern, will lease Spectradyne's manufacturing space for five years.
Spectradyne will purchase equipment from Cerplex for at least one year.
After that, Spectradyne will be free to buy equipment "off the shelf" from other manufacturers, a spokeswoman said.
No other terms of the accord were disclosed.
The operations involved employ almost 100 people.
