Acme-Cleveland Corp. expects to report a net loss despite "modestly higher" earnings from operations for the first quarter ended Dec. 31 and for the year ending next Sept. 30, said David L. Swift, chairman and chief executive officer.
In an interview, Mr. Swift cited a large extraordinary charge for post-retirement benefits as responsible for the estimated net loss for both periods.
In the year-earlier first quarter, Acme-Cleveland earned 13 cents a share from operations, and in the fiscal year earnings from operations were 65 cents a share.
Net income was $1.2 million, or 17 cents a share, for the 1993 first quarter and $7.1 million, or $1.07 a share, for the fiscal year.
Net for both the quarter and year included extraordinary tax credits, and fiscal-year net included a gain from settlement of litigation.
Sales in the fiscal 1994 first quarter fell below the $45.8 million of a year earlier because of a drop in communications-products orders, Mr. Swift said.
However, he said sales for the fiscal year are expected to rise 3% to 5% from the $174.9 million of fiscal 1993.
Acme-Cleveland is primarily a supplier to the auto industry and other durable-goods manufacturers, and is benefiting from high operating rates in those industries.
It supplies metal-products manufacturers with drills and other expendable tools, multiple spindle lathes, measuring equipment, sensors and controls.
The company also makes communications products ranging from closures to protect telephone line splices to computerized testing equipment.
Sales of those products are lower than a year ago.
Acme-Cleveland will report a 1994 first-quarter extraordinary charge of nearly $30 million, or $4.69 a share, said Earl J. Bellisario, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
The charge includes about $38 million of post-retirement benefit costs, partly offset by a gain from a change in accounting for deferred income taxes.
