The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is threatening to strike United Parcel Service of America on Monday because the package-delivery company is raising its package-weight limits.
Just four months after its last strike threat against UPS, the union said it will "grind the company to a halt" if it goes through with a plan to accept packages of 150 pounds, up from the current 70 pounds.
The change takes effect Monday.
Many in the industry considered a strike unlikely.
The 150-pound weight limit is standard in the industry, they say, and is used by UPS's main competitor Federal Express Corp.
Moreover, the union would have no legal grounds for a strike and could not survive a bitter labor dispute, they said.
A UPS spokesman said the company also believes a strike is unlikely.
"Frankly we don't understand why this has become such an issue," he said.
Company officials will meet with union officials today.
Teamsters officials contend they do have solid legal grounds for a strike.
Under federal labor law, a company must negotiate with a union for major changes in working conditions, they say.
The closely held package carrier is the largest Teamsters employer, with 165,000 unionized workers.
Several analysts suggested the Teamsters may be trying to strengthen its own position in current negotiations with the freighters.
The union recently kicked off talks with the nation's largest trucking firms for a new three-year contract.
