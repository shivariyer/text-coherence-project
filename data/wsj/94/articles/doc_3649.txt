Two blood-testing laboratories agreed to pay the U.S. $1.1 million to settle charges they submitted false claims to the government for unnecessary blood tests, the Justice Department said.
The two firms, Corning Inc.'s MetPath clinical-testing division and Unilab Corp. in Tarzana, Calif., performed tests that hadn't been requested by Pentagon doctors who provide health care for civilian dependents, according to Assistant Attorney General Frank Hunger.
He said they masked the charges for the tests in their bills.
Corning is based in Corning, N.Y. Unilab formerly did business as MetWest Inc., then part of MetPath.
"This case is part of the department's continuing effort to investigate and vigorously prosecute independent blood laboratories and other health-care providers who abuse or defraud the federal health-care system," said Mr. Hunger, who heads the department's civil division.
Last September, MetPath and MetWest agreed to a $39.8 million fine for similar practices involving the Medicare program.
Corning and MetPath couldn't be reached for comment.
A Unilab executive said, "The settlement won't have much financial impact on us, because Unilab's piece was only between $35,000 and $40,000."
The balance of the $1.1 million pact will be paid by Corning's MetPath division, he said.
