Reynolds Metals Co., Richmond, Va., agreed to buy Bev-Pak Inc., a closely held aluminum beverage-can maker in Monticello, Ind.
Terms weren't disclosed.
With the addition of Bev-Mark, Reynolds's capacity to make aluminum cans and can ends will rise to more than 18 billion from 16 billion annually.
Bev-Pak is a regional supplier to the soft-drink industry.
The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter, will be financed with proceeds from a recent preferred-stock offering of 10 million shares priced at $47.25 each.
Reynolds operates 14 aluminum-can plants and two can-end plants in the U.S., and a can plant in Puerto Rico.
It also has joint ventures in Brazil, Venezuela, and two plants under construction in Brazil and Chile.
