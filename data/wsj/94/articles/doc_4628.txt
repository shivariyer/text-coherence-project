Texaco Inc. said its Texaco Shanghai Inc. subsidiary and Shanghai Petroleum Corp. agreed to end negotiations begun in April 1993.
The companies were discussing terms for joint development of the offshore Ping Hu oil and natural-gas field 250 miles east of Shanghai in the East China Sea.
Texaco said the companies couldn't agree on terms that would make the project commercially viable for Texaco, and Shanghai Petroleum decided to develop the field on its own.
