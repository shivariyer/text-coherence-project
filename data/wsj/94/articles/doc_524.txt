The charge that Whitewater is reminiscent of Watergate "is preposterous," says Al Hunt ("Whitewater: It's the Coverup More Than the Deal," Politics & People, March 3).
Indeed, it was the coverup and lying plus assorted skeletons uncovered in the investigation that sank the Nixon presidency.
But the "deal" was a "crime," in which nothing was stolen and no one was hurt.
In the case of Whitewater we do not know if anything was stolen nor what skeletons may still be uncovered.
We do know that one of the participants committed suicide.
Stay tuned.
