Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British drinks and foods company, said it is setting up a new joint venture in Colombia to replace its existing unit.
The Bogota-based company, run via Grand Met's International Distillers & Vintners division, will be called International Distillers Colombia and will be 51%-owned by IDV.
Dario Parra, owner of the Licoresa drinks-distribution concern in Colombia, will own 15%, and the Aruba-based Posner family, which owns drinks-distribution businesses, will own 34%.
International Distillers Colombia will import and distribute IDV's brands, such as J&B Rare Scotch whisky, Smirnoff vodka, Baileys cream liqueur, Gilbey's gin, and Le Piat d'Or wine.
