Adam Opel AG, the German subsidiary of General Motors Corp., plans shortened work shifts in the first quarter to reduce production.
The short shifts will apply to three plants, but not to the flagship plant in Ruesselsheim, where the Omega, Vectra and Calibra models are built.
In Bochum, where the company builds its popular Astra model, six days of short shifts in the first quarter are planned.
In the parts plant at Kaiserslautern, seven days are planned, Opel said.
In the eastern German plant in Eisenach, where Opel manufactures Corsa and Astra, three days are planned.
