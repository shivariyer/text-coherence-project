Initial claims for state unemployment benefits averaged 348,250 in the four weeks ended March 5, down from an average of 352,500 in the four weeks ended Feb. 26, the Labor Department said.
In the March 5 week alone, claims totaled 346,000, up 32,000 from a revised 314,000 in the previous week, which included Washington's Birthday.
Claims are usually low in a holiday week, when there are fewer days to seek benefits, and rise the following week.
The four-week moving average is considered a better indicator of labor conditions.
All numbers are seasonally adjusted.
