BASF Corp., Charlotte, N.C., said it will end polyester-filament production at its Lowland, Tenn., plant by June 1, resulting in layoffs for 450 workers.
The company has discussed terms of sale for the Lowland plant but failed to reach an agreement with Wellman Inc., Shrewsbury, N.J.
BASF, a unit of BASF AG, had announced intentions about a year ago to pull out of the polyester chip and filament business.
While BASF continues to seek a buyer for the polyester-chip operation, about 100 workers will remain in manufacturing and support work.
Another 630 workers will be employed at the nylon operations, a core business for the company.
