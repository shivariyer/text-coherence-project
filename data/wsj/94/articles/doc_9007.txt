The price of a parcel of land related to the Whitewater controversy rose almost 172% in a little more than a year, thanks to a series of sales, including one in which Bill Clinton and his business partners sold the property to the company they controlled, Time magazine reports.
Time said it was unable to obtain the Clintons' 1979 income-tax return to learn whether the couple paid capital-gains taxes on what appears to be a paper profit on their sale of the land to Whitewater Development Co.
A White House spokeswoman said she couldn't comment on the Time report, saying all Whitewater matters are being examined by the Justice Department and will soon be the purview of a special counsel.
Citing deed records on file in Marion County, Ark., the magazine traced the Whitewater acreage from its original sale as part of a 3,600-acre tract sold by Arkla Land Co. in July 1978 to a company called 101 River Development Inc.
The sale price was about $400 an acre.
In early August 1978, according to Time, Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and their partners, James and Susan McDougal, purchased a 230-acre parcel from 101 River Development for $203,000, or about $882 an acre.
That parcel was sold in late September 1979 to Whitewater Development, the company newly formed by the Clintons and McDougals.
The transfer from the Clintons' and McDougals' individual ownership to their corporate ownership was accomplished at $250,000, or about $1,087 an acre, according to Time.
The president of the bank that provided a loan to Whitewater for that purchase -- James Patterson Jr. of Citzens Bank & Trust in Flippin, Ark. -- said the final per-acre price was higher than the original because the property had a large amount of river frontage.
