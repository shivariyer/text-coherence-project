Farragut Mortgage Co., Mansfield, Mass., reported in its 10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its management and outside accountants have "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern.
The company said it is in default on a $40 million line of credit signed last month.
It said it continues to have cash shortages because of a decline in service fees.
Farragut agreed to sell almost all of its $1 billion servicing portfolio last December for an undisclosed amount.
While the sale has closed, the company said it didn't get the proceeds it originally planned for because it was forced to use some of the money to repurchase loans from Fannie Mae that had defaulted.
Farragut said in the filing that it defaulted on a $40 million credit agreement signed last month with two lending banks, in part because it's not in compliance with a $2 million net-worth covenant.
Arthur Andersen & Co., Farragut's accountant, said in the 10K filing that the company is a defendant in a suit filed in 1993 related to loan-servicing rights that were sold with recourse upon default.
