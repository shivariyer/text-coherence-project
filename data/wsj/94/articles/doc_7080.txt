Polaroid Corp., benefiting from brisk sales of a new camera line, posted a 32% jump in fourth-quarter net income to $39.2 million, or 83 cents a share, compared with $29.6 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter sales rose 3.6% to $672.6 million from $649.2 million.
But the Cambridge, Mass., instant-camera and film maker cautioned analysts late yesterday that a ramp-up in production for the Helios medical and commercial imaging line and the expected falloff of sales under a Mexican voter-registration contract could hurt first-quarter profit.
"The first quarter and probably the first half of the year could be weak," said B. Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities.
Polaroid stock rose $1.375, or 4.1%, to close at $35 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
