Ladbroke PLC said 1993 pretax profit surged to #62.1 million ($93 million) from #5.2 million.
Sales gained 2.5% to #4.27 billion from #4.17 billion.
The British leisure concern said profit would have totaled #117.5 million but for a #55.4 million exceptional charge relating to property write-downs and reorganization costs.
Profit excluding exceptional charges fell short of the #120 million to #150 million analysts were expecting.
The cut in the full-year dividend to 6.0 pence a share was forecast, however, with some analysts predicting a payout as low as 5.5 pence a share.
