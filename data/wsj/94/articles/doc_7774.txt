United Technologies Corp. reported a fourth-quarter profit, reversing a year-earlier net loss.
Earnings rose 37% if one-time charges are excluded from the 1992 period.
But the Hartford, Conn., company said the continued weakness in its aerospace business, which includes its Pratt & Whitney jet engine unit, may result in employment reductions beyond the previously announced restructuring.
The company's fourth-quarter profit of $136 million, or 98 cents a primary share, was in line with analysts' expectations.
In the 1992 fourth quarter, the company had a net loss of $333 million, or $2.77 a share.
Before the one-time charges related to its exposure to the commercial airline industry and certain other contracts and the restructuring, the company earned $99 million, or 68 cents a fully diluted share.
Revenue in the latest period fell to $5.5 billion from $5.8 billion in 1992.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, United Technologies stock closed at $64.875, up 62.5 cents.
Robert F. Daniell, chairman, said the company "achieved its performance goals in 1993 despite the continuing weakness in the airline industry, and the European recession."
The company said all its businesses posted higher operating income in 1993, except for its Pratt & Whitney unit.
George David, president, predicted in an interview that 1994 will be "an up year."
He declined to make a forecast but said company officials "aren't uncomfortable" with the mean of analysts' earnings projections, which is $4.31 a fully diluted share, compared with 1993's fully diluted $3.30.
In 1993, Mr. David said, the company's Carrier, Otis, Automotive, and Flight Systems units together earned 15% more than the previous year.
He said he was "encouraged" that Pratt & Whitney's earnings during the second half of 1993 recovered from the severely depressed levels of a year earlier.
Pratt & Whitney's operating profit in the 1993 fourth quarter was $77 million, almost double the $39 million it posted a year earlier.
He attributed the increase to higher sales of commercial-engine spare parts and continued cost improvements.
He said the restructuring has reduced the work force by 24,700 through the end of last year, about 95% of the 26,100 jobs the company had said it would eliminate by 1995.
But he said weak markets, especially aerospace, "may increase the reduction beyond this level."
He declined to estimate by how much.
The company currently has 168,600 employees.
For all of 1993, United Technologies had net income of $487 million, or $3.53 a primary share.
That was up about 4.2% from $467 million, or $3.22 a fully diluted share, in 1992, before one-time accounting changes and special charges taken in 1992.
Including the charges and accounting changes related to post-retirement benefits, United Technologies had a net loss in 1992 of $287 million, or $2.67 a share.
Last year's revenue declined to $21.1 billion from $22 billion in 1992.
Besides the fall-off in aerospace, the stronger U.S. dollar against major European currencies lowered revenue and earnings in 1993.
The company said the latter reduced revenue by $602 million and earnings by 19 cents a fully diluted share.
