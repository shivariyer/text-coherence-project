A Litton Industries Inc. unit pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges and agreed to pay $3.9 million in the finale of the most successful military corruption probe in modern times.
As part of the plea agreement filed in federal court here, officially ending the six-year "Operation Ill Wind" investigation, Litton conceded that it conspired with a consultant to try illegally to obtain bid-related information on three Navy contracts.
By paying criminal and civil penalties, the company said it was assured that none of its units will be suspended or barred from receiving additional government business.
Relying on extensive use of wiretaps and plea agreements, the nationwide probe has resulted in the conviction of more than 60 individuals and companies, as well as more than $250 million in recoveries for the U.S. Treasury.
Attorney General Janet Reno, calling the probe "one of the most successful" white-collar crime investigations ever pursued by the government, said it will serve "as a prototype for future investigations into environmental crimes, healthcare fraud, insurance fraud" and other schemes against the government.
Joe Aronica, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted all of the Ill Wind defendants, said over the weekend that the investigation prompted the Pentagon to crack down on the use of consultants.
As a result of the scandal, Mr. Aronica said, defense concerns also were forced to step up internal ethics compliance programs and give the government greater access to such audits.
As previously reported, Litton remains the subject of two other criminal investigations involving allegedly improper payments to a marketing consultant in Taiwan and claims by a whistleblower that one of the company's units overcharged military and commercial customers for gyroscope repairs.
