Intel Corp. said fourth-quarter net income was up 38% but slightly below financial analysts' mean expectations.
It cited greater-than-usual costs of starting up several new factory lines that will make its latest microprocessors.
The Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker said net income in the quarter ended Dec. 25 was $594 million, or $1.35 a share, compared with $429 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier.
Analysts' mean estimate for per-share net income was $1.41, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
Intel's revenue in the quarter reflected continuing strong growth in sales of its microprocessors, which dominate the personal-computer market, rising 29% to $2.39 billion from $1.86 billion.
Intel said in a release it is "on track" to ship several million of its new Pentium microprocessors in 1994.
As part of its drive to begin moving PC users over to the new chip from its older "486" chips, Intel has invested heavily in factories to produce them.
In particular, costs were higher than normal for starting new lines in California and Ireland to produce Pentium chips, Intel said.
But those start-up expenses will begin paying back later this year, said analyst Millard Phelps of Hambrecht & Quist, when Intel's factories begin producing large volumes of Pentium chips and new versions of 486s, which will provide higher profit margins than Intel's existing lineup.
"The long-term view is very solid for them" because of Intel's heavy capital investments, Mr. Phelps said.
For the year, Intel reported that net income more than doubled to $2.30 billion, or $5.20 a share, from $1.07 billion, or $2.49 a share, in 1992.
Revenue rose 50% to $8.78 billion from $5.84 billion.
The year-earlier per-share figures were adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split paid in June 1993.
Intel's stock closed at $67.25 a share, up $1, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
The company released its earnings after the close of trading.
