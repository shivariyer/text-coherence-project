An estimated 16,000 tobacco industry workers marched on the Capitol to protest the Clinton administration's plan to raise tobacco taxes to help pay for health-care legislation.
The rally was organized primarily by members of the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers union and other industry employees, according to Ray Scannell, director of research and special projects for the union.
Philip Morris Cos. and other companies gave their employees the day off to attend the march.
Under the Clinton health-care plan, the tax on a pack of cigarettes would rise to 99 cents from the current 24 cents.
Other tobacco products also would be hit with higher taxes.
Many of the marchers carried signs with slogans such as "Health Care, Yes . . .
Excise Tax Hike, No."
The Tobacco Growers Information Committee estimated that if a 75 cent-a-pack tax increase were imposed, 18,000 farmers would lose their jobs.
The march started around noon at the Ellipse, went past the White House, and concluded about 90 minutes later at the Capitol steps.
There, the throng was addressed by labor and industry leaders, as well as lawmakers from tobacco-growing states.
