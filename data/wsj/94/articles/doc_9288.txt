Federal Express Corp., Memphis, Tenn., said average daily volume of express packages and documents rose 8% in December from a year earlier.
While the company and some analysts said the growth was in line with expectations, the increase was less than half that reported for 1992's December-over-December comparison.
Some analysts had been projecting growth of more than 20% for December 1993 because of the company's new, exclusive contract with catalog giant L.L. Bean.
"This is somewhat disappointing," said Paul R. Schlesinger, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
Federal Express said it is misleading to compare the December 1992-1993 growth rate with the December 1991-1992 rate because of the way the holidays fell this past December, and because prices were firmer this past December.
Some analysts added that the 1992 Christmas was stronger than usual, and that 1991 was unusually weak.
