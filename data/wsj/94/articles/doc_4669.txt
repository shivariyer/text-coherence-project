Valspar Corp. said its McWhorter Resins Inc. unit completed the acquisition of the resin-products division of Cargill Inc.
Valspar agreed in May to pay about $90 million for the division, a maker of specialized resins used in paints and fiberglass products.
The Minneapolis company said that, effective immediately, its resin business will be operated as two separate companies: McWhorter Technologies Inc. and Engineered Polymer Solutions Inc.
Valspar plans to spin off McWhorter Technologies, the larger of the two separate resin businesses, through a distribution of shares to its shareholders in April or May.
