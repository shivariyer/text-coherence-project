Japan's Sony Corp. said it filed a motion yesterday to postpone a patent-infringement suit brought by Eastman Kodak Co. last year.
Sony's motion follows last week's ruling by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that rejected Kodak's patent claims that are at issue in the lawsuit.
Kodak has 60 days to respond to the office's action.
Sony asked the court to postpone the trial, scheduled for June, until a final ruling by the patent office is issued.
An earlier motion for postponement was denied, yesterday's filing was for a reconsideration of that motion.
Kodak is suing Sony and its Sony Corp. of America unit for allegedly infringing on Kodak's 1981 U.S. patent covering magnetic recording technology.
Sony has said that the patent is invalid "based on technology which was in the public domain" before Kodak filed its patent.
