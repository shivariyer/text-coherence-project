Beverly Enterprises Inc. posted fourth-quarter net income of $16.8 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $32.5 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier.
The Fort Smith, Ark., operator of nursing homes said revenue rose 6% to $736.9 million from $692.9 million.
The results were in line with analysts' projections.
Beverly attributed the improved results to the continuing growth of ancillary services, including rehabilitation programs, in-house pharmacy operations and subacute care, which involves caring for patients who are sicker than traditional nursing-home patients but no longer require the services of an acute-care hospital.
A spokesman also said that the company had kept expenses in check by further consolidating purchasing activities of its facilities.
