CCX Inc., Charlotte, N.C., said its creditors approved its prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan.
The maker of meshes for screening and filtration said the plan provides for a multiyear banking agreement, the conversion of the company's subordinated debt to equity and the cancellation of all the company's preferred and common stock.
Last week the company said it was seeking a banking agreement for $24 million and had $13.7 million in subordinated debt.
With the approval, CCX was able to file a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court yesterday.
Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, a company is protected from creditors while it reorganizes its finances.
A prepackaged plan generally permits a company to emerge from Chapter 11 faster than it would otherwise.
In early March, the New York Stock Exchange said trading in CCX's common and 5% cumulative preferred stock was suspended.
The Big Board said it would apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the stock, citing a failure to meet certain financial criteria.
