California Federal Bank said the final exercise price of its common stock warrants has been adjusted to five warrants plus $9 to purchase one share of the bank's common stock between June 1 and June 30.
The previous estimated exercise price was five warrants plus $8.
The bank also said the conversion price of its 7.75% noncumulative convertible preferred stock Series A into shares of its common has been adjusted to $20.90 a share.
The previous estimated conversion price was $21.67 a share.
The rights offering was used to raise $195 million in equity.
It is part of the bank's strategy to "hold and fix" itself rather than selling to a bidder.
