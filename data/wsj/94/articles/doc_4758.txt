The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited two Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. operations for workplace safety violations.
The agency cited the ADM Truck unit in Decatur, Ill., for four "willful violations," six "serious" violations and three lesser alleged safety-rule breaches.
OSHA's inspection at the trucking plant followed a fatal accident in which a contract employee, hired to clean and inspect tank trailers, was asphyxiated inside a trailer which hadn't been properly vented prior to his entry.
OSHA also cited the company's ADM West plant in Decatur for two willful and two serious alleged safety violations, following a non-fatal accident in which three contract workers were felled by lack of oxygen during the cleaning of a soybean oil tank.
The agency proposed $318,000 in penalties.
Archer-Daniels, an agricultural food-ingredient processor, has 15 days to contest the citations and proposed penalties.
An Archer-Daniels spokesman said the company will contest the citations.
