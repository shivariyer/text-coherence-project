The Chicago Board Options Exchange set a Jan. 28 launch date to trade options contracts based on an index of stocks on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The options will work similarly to the CBOE's popular options based on indexes of the Standard & Poor's 100 and 500 leading exchange-traded stocks, except that they will track 100 nonfinancial Nasdaq stocks.
"Options traded on the Nasdaq 100 will offer investors a new tool for participating in the highly traded issues on Nasdaq," said CBOE Chairman Alger B. Chapman.
