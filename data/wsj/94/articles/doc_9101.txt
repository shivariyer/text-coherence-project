Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp., in the wake of recent disclosures regarding possible operating losses in 1994, said five shareholder suits have been filed against the company.
The complaints, filed in U.S. District Court here, allege violations of federal securities laws.
The plaintiffs, according to Mobile Telecommunications, are seeking to have the proceedings certified as class actions.
On Jan. 5, the telecommunications company said it will reduce pricing at its SkyTel Corp. unit.
The effect of reduced SkyTel profit, together with start-up losses from international joint ventures, are expected to result in losses from operations in 1994.
News of the possible losses helped push down the company's share price to $16.50, off $9.625, on the day the plans were announced.
In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market Friday, Mobile Telecommunications closed at $17.875 a share, down 12.5 cents.
Friday, in a statement, the company said it believes it has "always observed and acted in accordance with all securities laws, and that these claims are unfounded and without merit."
The company added that it intends to "defend against these lawsuits vigorously."
Mobile Telecommunications also said that, while it was "disappointed" with the drop in its stock price, the new strategy is designed to position the company for future growth.
