Sprint Corp.'s fourth-quarter net income jumped 78% on robust revenue growth in long-distance and cellular telephone services and improved costcutting.
While the company is still a distant third in the long-distance market behind American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp., Sprint's profit and revenue numbers were higher than analysts' predictions.
Sprint's local phone operations continued to outperform the regional Bell companies in revenue and phone-line growth.
Fourth-quarter net was $189.1 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $106.5 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue grew 10% to $2.98 billion from $2.7 billion.
For the year, charges totaling $619.4 million in 1993 resulted in net income of $54.9 million, or 15 cents a share, down 89% from $502.8 million, or $1.48 a share, in 1992.
The charges were taken for post-retirement benefits, early debt retirement and costs associated with Sprint's merger with Centel Corp.
Revenue climbed 9% to $11.37 billion from $10.42 billion.
"We've got all our cylinders running now," William T. Esrey, Sprint's chairman, said in an interview.
Some analysts believe Sprint will soon line up international service partners as MCI and AT&T have done.
But Mr. Esrey declined to comment.
"An international deal will be signed in the next two months," contended Blake Bath, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co.
"It's imminent and could include an equity infusion from a major investor.
Sprint is capital constrained."
