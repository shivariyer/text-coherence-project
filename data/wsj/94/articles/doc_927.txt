Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses plummeted 14% in February from a year earlier, to 896,097 units, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
February marked the 17th consecutive month of decline in Japan's auto production, and the sixth month that output plummeted by more than 10%.
An association spokesman said the slump in domestic production is likely to continue in the coming months.
Demand is expected to start picking up in the latter half of the year.
