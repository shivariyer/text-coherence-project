Medrad Inc., Pittsburgh, said earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 31 will include an asset write-down of about $1.6 million related to inventory of the company's image-enhancement line.
Medrad, which makes products that improve the clarity of medical images of the human body, said results for the fiscal 1994 fourth quarter and year will "reflect slowing growth due to market uncertainties and heightened pricing pressures affecting the health-care industry."
The company reported profit of $2.5 million, or 39 cents a share, for the year-ago fourth quarter.
The company expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenue in 1994 to fall 3% to about $20.6 million from $21.3 million, reflecting reduced equipment sales.
For the year, it expects profit to be "slightly ahead" of 1993 results, and revenue to be about $71.7 million, up from $67.4 million in 1993.
