In an extraordinary effort to boost Rep. Dan Rostenkowski's precarious re-election prospects, President Clinton braved the cold and snow here to declare that the administration's top legislative priorities were bound up in the lawmaker's fate.
Mr. Clinton was amplifying what the Illinois Democrat has been telling his constituents: that he is an important national leader who should be returned to Washington despite his recent brushes with the law.
The president made clear that Mr. Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was pivotal to his two biggest initiatives this year, overhauling the health-care and welfare systems.
Without him, Mr. Clinton said, "We would not be able to do the things that we have to do to meet our obligations to the future in this coming year in health care, welfare reform and many other areas."
In other circumstances such glowing words would constitute an endorsement, and in every practical sense they were.
But Mr. Clinton didn't actually use the word "endorsement," and didn't directly refer to the March 15 primary at which Mr. Rostenkowski's seat is being sought by other Democrats.
For one thing, it is rare for a president to intervene in a party primary contest.
For another, Mr. Rostenkowski is under investigation by Mr. Clinton's own Justice Department for possible misuse of his congressional and campaign funds.
