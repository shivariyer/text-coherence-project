Britain's Cable & Wireless PLC said it is part of a consortium to plan a high-capacity fiber-optic submarine cable to link 14 islands in the Caribbean.
The cost of the installed system is expected to be $60 million, with Cable & Wireless to invest 66%, France Telecom 18% and American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 6%.
There are several other minority shareholders.
Cable & Wireless said the Eastern Caribbean Fiber System will cover 1,073 miles and will extend from the British Virgin Islands in the north to Trinidad in the south.
The system is intended to improve security from hurricanes and meet future telecommunications demands.
Construction of the cable is expected to start in March.
It is expected to be ready to begin service by early 1995.
