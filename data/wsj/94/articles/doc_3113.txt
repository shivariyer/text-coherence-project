Ford Motor Co. said it temporarily halted production of its new Windstar minivan to replace a defective shock absorber that squeaks in cold weather.
A spokesman said Ford is delaying shipment of 5,400 Windstars because "all aspects of its quality standards were not met."
The company stopped production at the Oakville, Ontario, assembly plant Wednesday to replace the shock absorbers.
Ford said it will resume production of the Windstar today.
Windstar is expected to roll into dealerships this month.
Separately, Ford said all but its Wixom, Mich., luxury-car assembly plant worked overtime last week.
General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. both said they plan overtime this week at several assembly plants.
Altogether, the domestic auto makers plan to build 256,321 vehicles, up 17.7% from the 217,742 vehicles built in the same week last year.
