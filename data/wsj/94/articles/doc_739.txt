Abex Inc. said it settled a tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service for the 1986-1988 tax years, resulting in a $94 million gain.
The gain reflects the difference between the amount of the settlement and the reserve the company had included on its balance sheet while the matter was unresolved.
The aerospace and industrial-products concern recorded the gain in its 1993 fourth quarter, restating previously announced results for that quarter and the year.
For the restated fourth quarter of 1993, the company reported net income of $92.3 million, or $4.68 a share.
For the year, the company reported net income of $39.4 million, or $1.99 a share.
Previously, the company had reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $1.7 million, or eight cents a share, and a net loss of $54.6 million, or $2.77 a share, for the year.
A spokesman said the dispute, unresolved for five years, related to the cost basis of stock sold by Abex in 1988.
