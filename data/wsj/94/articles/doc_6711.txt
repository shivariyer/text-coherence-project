Scotts Co. officials said they expect sharply higher earnings for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 because of rising consumer spending on homes and yards and a large number of new products.
Officials of the Marysville, Ohio, producer of fertilizers, soils and other lawn and garden products were unwilling to give specific earnings estimates, but they didn't quarrel with analyst projections for a rise in per-share earnings of more than 25%, to $1.35 a share, and a sales increase of well over 30%, to between $625 million and $650 million.
In fiscal 1993, Scotts had operating profit of $21 million, or $1.07 a share, on sales of $466 million.
After an extraordinary charge for accounting changes, net income was $7.9 million, or 40 cents a share.
