Moody's Investors Service Inc. upgraded $500 million of senior debt to single-A-3 from Baa1, saying it expects that CBS cash flow will continue to benefit from the company's position as the leading television network, an improving advertising market, and reduced debt-service requirements after a debt-to-equity conversion earlier this year.
Moody's said its rating "continues to recognize" the inherent volatility of the CBS television network and some uncertainties about future financial strategies.
