Conrail Inc., a rail-freight carrier, said its first-quarter earnings would be hurt by the extreme winter weather.
The Philadelphia-based carrier said the weather would have a "substantially adverse impact" on the period's results.
But it said the "growing strength of traffic and our commitment of managing productivity will help us offset the incremental first-quarter costs caused by the weather."
A year earlier, Conrail earned 52 cents a share before accounting changes for postretirement benefits, on $816 million in revenues.
After the accounting changes, it had a loss of 39 cents a share.
In addition to snow and ice problems, the weather forced Conrail to run shorter trains, which required more personnel and locomotives to move freight.
The company also said that 330 nonunion employees out of about 400 eligible accepted an early-retirement program announced in December.
Conrail estimates it will take a charge of $75 million to $85 million before taxes in the first quarter to cover the cost of the program.
