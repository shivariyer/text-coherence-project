Golden West Financial Corp. sweetened its proposed takeover bid for troubled California Federal Bank, offering to add a speculative security that would equal the difference in the two banks' valuation of CalFed.
In a letter to CalFed's board, Golden West's chairman and chief executive officer, Herbert M. Sandler, proposed the establishment of reserves covering possible additional losses on CalFed's assets.
Mr. Sandler said Golden West would consult with CalFed's adviser, First Boston, to establish the reserves.
Under the acquisition offer, CalFed holders would receive a security representing an interest in the reserves.
"To the extent the additional reserves prove to be unneccesary," Mr. Sandler said, "then holders of this security would receive the value of the reserve."
Golden West acknowledged the proposal was based on a similar provision invented by BankAmerica Corp. during its successful takeover of Seafirst Corp. a decade ago.
Those securities, dubbed "hope certificates" by skeptics in the financial community, proved nearly worthless to Seafirst shareholders when the Seattle-based bank's loans were evaluated by outside umpires over the five years after the securities were issued.
Mr. Sandler's offer comes on top of Golden West's conditional $630 million bid for CalFed last month.
Golden West said it would pay $21.50 a share for CalFed's 25 million common shares outstanding, plus $90 million for preferred stock, but would deduct potential losses uncovered during Golden's review of CalFed's records, such as any additional real-estate write-downs.
CalFed's board rejected the offer, saying it wasn't enough and declaring the Los Angeles-based thrift was not for sale at this time.
CalFed, with $15.7 billion in assets, has reported continuing losses, although a spokesman said it cut its nonperforming assets by 31% in the last quarter.
CalFed's spokesman declined to comment on Golden West's sweetened bid, other than to say the thrift's board would look at it during its next scheduled meeting Feb. 18.
Some analysts cheered Golden West's new bid.
"It's about as firm an offer as they could come up with at this stage," said Joseph Jolson of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
Mr. Jolson said that, given CalFed's shaky finances, the thrift would be wise to accept the plan.
Privately, however, several people contacted -- CalFed officials and large shareholders in the thrift -- dismissed the scheme as too speculative to be meaningful.
"If they were willing to issue Golden West stock to make up the difference, that might be something," said one large holder, who requested anonymity.
"I don't know what value this security has.
I don't think it will get past the board."
Golden West's common stock fell 50 cents, or 1.1%, to close at $44.125 a share, while CalFed's fell 12.5 cents, or 0.8%, to $14.875, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
