Authorities made a "terrible mistake" in filing a murder charge against a 12-year-old girl who confessed to killing her toddler cousin in 1984, a prosecutor said.
Hamilton County Prosecutor Joseph Deters said his office won't pursue the charge of juvenile delinquency for committing murder.
He expected a Juvenile Court judge to dismiss the charge at a hearing today .
The girl was three when her 10-month-old cousin drowned in a bucket of bleach and water in their Cincinnati apartment.
The death had been ruled accidental.
Last month, the girl told police she killed the boy.
"I consider it a terrible mistake to have charged her," Mr. Deters said.
"We could not proceed criminally, on any basis, against somebody who was three years old at the time. . . .
It was a stupid thing to do."
The case was the subject of a recent page one article in The Wall Street Journal.
