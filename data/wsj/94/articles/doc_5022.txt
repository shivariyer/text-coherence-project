Statoil AS, Norway's national oil company, said it acquired a 38% equity stake in privately held Eastern Group Inc., Alexandria, Va., to market and distribute natural gas in the U.S.
Statoil North America Inc., Statoil's Stamford, Conn., marketing and trading affiliate, will provide a minimum of 200 billion cubic feet of natural gas over the next five years to Eastern's gas-marketing and transportation unit, Appalachian Gas Sales.
The natural gas will be acquired in the U.S. market through purchases, as well as exchanges and sales agreements with North Sea oil marketed by Statoil North America, the companies said.
