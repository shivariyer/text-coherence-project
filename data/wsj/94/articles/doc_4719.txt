Coors Brewing Co., a unit of Adolph Coors Co., will pay a fine of $237,000 to Colorado's Department of Health for air-pollution violations discovered by the beer company.
Coors also agreed to reduce 193 tons of VOCs, or volatile organic compounds -- organic air emissions from evaporation of beer.
Also, the company will relinquish to the state the pollution allowances it holds for VOCs and will modify its existing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission permits to help the state win EPA approval for the state's air-quality implementation plan.
The VOC issue arose when Coors discovered that, despite state and federal publications to the contrary, breweries are substantial emitters of VOCs.
When Coors told the state it had discovered VOC emissions at its brewery, the state immediately slapped the company with a $1.05 million fine.
The state's reaction elicited angry cries from businessmen, editorial writers and the governor's office in Colorado, which feared that such punitive action by the Health Department would discourage other companies from sharing pollution information with the state.
The Health Department, however, continued to demand other concessions from Coors in exchange for lowering the fine.
"We think we arrived at a fair settlement that benefits the environment," said Dave Ouimette, a Health Department official.
Due to Coors's action, the state and the EPA have information about brewery VOC emissions that could lead to fines at other beer makers.
The Health Department issued a notice of violation to Anheuser-Busch Cos. for VOC violations at its Fort Collins, Colo., brewery after the Coors discovery.
