One critic has called "environmentalism" an essentially meaningless term because it does not distinguish any distinct concern or point of view.
Who does not want clean air and water, or a variety of wildlife and beautiful places?
But a sympathetic student of environmentalism is closer to the mark when he suggests that environmentalists are the "vanguard of a new society."
Being an environmentalist, in other words, means being part of a political or moral crusade for a better world.
Environmentalism is heir to the antislavery and temperance movements and thus a part of the ongoing saga of evangelical reform that has characterized American history.
Indeed, it is not so far off the mark to say that environmentalism is the temperance movement of our time.
We know it wants to save the earth.
But we forget just how much, in the spirit of its predecessor, it seeks to save us from ourselves.
