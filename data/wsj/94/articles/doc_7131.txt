Germany's largest auto maker, Volkswagen AG, said its cost-cutting efforts over the past 15 months have yielded the financially troubled company 3.5 billion marks ($2.01 billion) in savings.
Nevertheless, the company didn't offer a new forecast for its 1993 results.
Previously, VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech predicted the company will post a net loss of 2.3 billion marks in 1993.
