David Brooks's Feb. 28 editorial-page piece "Forget Mideast Peace, Aim for Divorce" overlooks the fact that his recommendation has already been tried -- and has failed.
From 1949-1967, Israelis and Palestinian Arabs were shut off by the walls he recommends, in Jerusalem literally by walls dividing the city in two, in the south by barbed-wire fences.
But Arab terrorists penetrated the walls and the fences; Israeli forces inevitably retaliated (the alternative was to permit open season for murder of Israeli citizens); and the walls and fences did nothing to prevent two wars, in 1956 and 1967.
The Israeli government, the silly rhetoric from some quarters about Middle East common markets notwithstanding, is in fact setting out to implement the twice-failed policy Mr. Brooks recommends.
A few weeks ago I was in southern Israel and learned that the government has ordered the settlements along the old Green Line to install fences on their borders in expectation of the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
What the events following the handshake on the White House lawn illustrate is not the need for walls and fences behind which Israel should hide, but the failure of the government's "peace" policy.
Dr. Baruch Goldstein's shooting rampage followed a long series of murders by Arabs -- within Israel's 1949 borders as well as in the post 1967 settlements -- fueled by the perception that Israel was on the run and its citizens easy targets.
The policy Mr. Brooks recommends and the Israeli government seeks to implement can only lead, as it has before, to terror, reprisal and war.
This time, Israel may be annihilated or, best-case scenario, it may reconquer at terrible cost the territories it now foolishly abandons.
