International Family Entertainment Inc. terminated its tender offer for the shares of Nostalgia Network Inc.
The tender offer was priced at $2 a share for common stock, and at $200 a share for all preferred shares outstanding.
But IFE's offer, which had been extended twice before, was rejected because the Nostalgia board considered it to be too low, among other reasons.
IFE could have come back with a higher bid but the company declined to comment yesterday.
IFE, which owns the Family cable channel, is a Virginia Beach, Va., media company founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson.
IFE said it was informed by the depositary that about 5.6 million of the approximately 20 million common shares outstanding had been tendered as of yesterday, but no preferred shares.
