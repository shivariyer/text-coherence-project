Moody's Investors Service Inc. raised senior debt ratings for Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp. and certain subsidiaries of both banks.
The ratings agency raised Citicorp's senior debt to A2 from Baa1.
About $34 billion in debt was affected.
Moody's said the upgrades reflect the bank's improving core profitability as well as continued reductions in overhead costs.
Moody's also said Citicorp's disposition of its Quotron unit, combined with declining credit costs, will allow markedly higher profitability in coming years.
Citicorp has about $217 billion in assets.
Citicorp had been placed under review for possible upgrade on Jan. 18.
Standard & Poor's Corp. had raised Citicorp's senior debt rating to single-A from single-A-minus earlier this week.
Moody's upgraded Chase Manhattan's senior debt to A3 from Baa1.
About $8.4 billion in debt was affected.
The ratings agency said the upgrade reflects improvements in the bank's asset quality and capital ratios.
In addition, Moody's said, the bank has greatly reduced its exposure to refinancing countries through sales, charge-offs or reclassification of loans.
The ratings agency added that the company's financial position has benefited from cyclical improvements in the U.S. economy.
Chase Manhattan has about $102 billion in assets.
The bank had been placed under review for possible upgrade on Jan. 24.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Citibank eased 12.5 cents to $41 and Chase Manhattan fell 25 cents to $33.50.
