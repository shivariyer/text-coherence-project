Honda Motor Co. said it has notified 1.8 million Accord and Civic owners of an electrical glitch that may prevent the cars from starting and, in rare cases, cause them to stall.
The auto maker said one million of its 1988 through 1991 Civics and 800,000 of its 1990 through 1991 Accords are affected.
Honda began notifying owners last summer and completed its notification effort in January.
Two accidents have occurred as a result of the problem, but there have been no injuries.
The Accord and Civic are Honda's top-selling cars.
Honda said the igniter units in the affected models aren't durable enough to ensure consistent starting.
Honda has notified all owners by mail, and has instructed them to take their vehicles to area dealerships for free repairs.
