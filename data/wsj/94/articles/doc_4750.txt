Zonic Corp., Cincinnati, said it is continuing to experience "serious cash flow problems" and is negotiating with its lenders for an extension of its debt obligations.
It said it has retained a New York investment banking firm to assist it.
It said that it expects continued losses in its fourth quarter, ending March 31, but that it is "hopeful" of a return to profitability in fiscal 1995, starting April 1.
For the three months ended Dec. 31, Zonic reported a loss of $2.3 million, or 73 cents a share, on sales of $1 million.
That compared with a loss of $364,259, or 12 cents a share, on sales of $1.4 million in the year-earlier fiscal third quarter.
The software and test equipment company attributed the losses primarily to substantial software and inventory writedowns and increased reserves for bad debts, as well as a decline in sales.
Zonic reported a loss of $683,572, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $1.7 million for the year-ago quarter.
