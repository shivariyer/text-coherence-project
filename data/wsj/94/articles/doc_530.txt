Michael Tanner's critique of the Cooper health reform bill ("Cooper Plan, Clinton Lite," editorial page, Feb. 14) perpetuates the myth that under this bill consumers can buy health insurance when they need it and not be subject to pre-existing-condition restrictions.
This is not the case.
On the contrary, the Cooper bill would deny full health-care protection to people with pre-existing conditions.
Insurers could limit their coverage for the first six months of enrollment (unless a customer was merely switching from one insurance plan to another).
Children with diabetes would not get their needed insulin for six months.
Men and women with high blood pressure would be out of luck for any number of related health needs for this period.
For them, and for those afflicted with cancer and other life-threatening diseases, a six-month wait for coverage could mean life or death.
The administration's bill and the Wellstone/McDermott/Conyers single-payer bill are the only health reform bills before Congress that fully protect consumers without interruption -- regardless of present health status.
