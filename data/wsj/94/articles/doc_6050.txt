A military judge accused the Navy's top officer of unlawfully trying to manipulate the Tailhook investigation, reviving the question of whether the admiral would be ousted.
Navy Capt. William Vest Jr., in a ruling that dismissed Tailhook-related charges against three Navy fliers, asserted that Adm. Frank Kelso, the chief of naval operations, used "unlawful command influence" over the investigation of Tailhook violations and over the subsequent disciplining of naval officers.
The judge also rejected some of Adm. Kelso's testimony about what he witnessed at the 1991 Tailhook convention of naval aviators in Las Vegas.
It wasn't immediately clear how Adm. Kelso or his civilian superiors would react to the judge's finding, which was issued in Norfolk, Va.
A spokesman for the admiral said he was still reviewing the judge's statement.
A spokesman for Navy Secretary John Dalton didn't have an immediate comment.
A spokeswoman for Defense Secretary William Perry said he hasn't had a chance to review the judge's decision.
She said that within the chain of command, the first response must come from the Navy.
Navy Secretary Dalton recommended in early October to then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin that Adm. Kelso be forced to retire early for his handling of the Tailhook scandal.
But Mr. Aspin rejected the recommendation, partly because he admired Adm. Kelso's deft reorganization of the tradition-bound Navy to fit the post-Cold War world, and partly because the admiral learned of the recommendation only after it leaked to CBS News.
The controversy over firing Adm. Kelso was soon overwhelmed by events in Somalia: Mr. Aspin made the decision to keep on the admiral on Oct. 3, just as news was arriving that scores of U.S. Army Rangers and special-forces troops had been wounded in a firefight in downtown Mogadishu.
Partly because of events in Somalia, Mr. Aspin himself was pressured by the president into submitting his resignation just two months later.
