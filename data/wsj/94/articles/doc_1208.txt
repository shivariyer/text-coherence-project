International Airlines parent PWA Corp. signed a formal cooperation pact with Air Canada Ltd., clearing away the last obstable to a much-needed equity infusion from AMR Corp.
A spokeswoman for Calgary-based PWA said that with the agreement, the company is working toward concluding its proposed transaction with AMR, Dallas, by the middle of next month.
The transaction would see American Airlines parent AMR inject 246 million Canadian dollars (US$180 million) into PWA, which has had a string of annual losses, provided that Canadian transfers its seat-reservation and other data-processing services to AMR's Sabre network.
In a joint announcement, Air Canada, Toronto, said it will "fully cooperate" with Canadian in the transfer, adding that PWA and an affiliate of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines have transferred to Air Canada their interests in the Gemini seat-reservation system that they previously owned jointly with Air Canada, leaving Air Canada as Gemini's sole owner.
