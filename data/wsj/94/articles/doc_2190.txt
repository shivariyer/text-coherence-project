Checkers Drive-In Restaurants Inc., Clearwater, Fla., said it expects to report a first-quarter loss and will scale back its expansion plans for 1994.
The fast-food chain cited "significant" sales pressure from competitors as a primary reason for the drop in earnings.
Other factors include a decline in tourism in parts of Florida and bad weather in other East Coast markets.
Checkers said it will also record a reserve in the first quarter of approximately $4.5 million, or six cents a share, for expansion costs.
Including the reserve, the company expects to report a first-quarter loss of three cents to four cents a share.
Excluding the reserve, Checkers said it would have posted a profit of two cents to three cents a share.
In the first quarter of 1992, the company posted net income of $3.2 million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $33.6 million.
Checkers said it plans to open 110 company-operated restaurants in 1994, down from 150 originally, and 90 franchised operations, down from 100.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, the stock closed at $7.375, down 62.5 cents.
