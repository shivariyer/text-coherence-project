Hours before the first flight was scheduled to leave, the U.S. government granted one-time permission for a Japan Airlines airliner to fly to Hawaii on a new route.
Japanese government and airline officials said they would continue to press Washington for full approval of the new route, which apparently has fallen victim to a broader aviation dispute.
JAL's application to make weekly flights to Honolulu from the northern city of Sendai is pending at the U.S. Transportation Department.
U.S. officials cleared the way early in the day for the first flight yesterday afternoon.
Almost 300 people had already reserved tickets, a Japanese Transport Ministry official said.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Washington put the application on hold because of opposition from United Airlines and Federal Express Corp.
The U.S. and Japan are negotiating an agreement on air service and several issues remain unresolved.
In particular, U.S. carriers seek approval for increased flights to Osaka when a new airport opens in September.
