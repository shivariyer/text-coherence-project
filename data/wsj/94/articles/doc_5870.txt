Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. reported a 29% jump in fourth-quarter profit, reflecting stronger operating performance and lower expenses.
Net income was $113.2 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with $87.5 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier.
The 1992 figure included a one-time loss of $15.3 million, or 11 cents a share, for the early retirement of debt.
Sales were $2.92 billion compared with $2.93 billion, although the 1992 figure included about $87 million of sales from divested assets.
World-wide sales in 1993 were $11.64 billion, down from $11.78 billion.
Excluding the sale of divested assets, overall sales would have been $11.35 billion in 1992.
"Continued improvement in operating performance, the sale of assets and the conversion of $117 million of Euro convertible debentures to common stock enabled the company to reduce its debt by $525 million to $1.4 billion at the end of 1993," Goodyear said.
In the tire business, fourth-quarter sales rose 2.6% to $2.51 billion, and were up 2%, to $9.96 billion, for the full year.
Overall, Goodyear's sales were flat in the U.S. for both periods, due to the sale of divested assets.
Among regions, operations in Asia posted lower sales and operating profit reflecting sluggish economies and the adverse effect of exchange rates.
"We expect 1994 to be a better year for sales growth if the world economies improve," Goodyear said.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Goodyear was up 62.5 cents at $48.125.
