Hayes-Dana Inc. said it received two auto-parts contracts from General Motors Corp. valued at about 60 million Canadian dollars (US$44 million) annually.
Hayes-Dana, an auto-parts concern based in St. Catharines, Ontario, is 57%-owned by Dana Corp., Toledo, Ohio.
Hayes-Dana said it will supply frame assemblies for GM's GMT-600 van starting in the 1996 model year.
That contract will be worth about C$40 million annually for an indefinite period.
Hayes-Dana was also awarded a three-year contract worth about C$20 million annually to supply drive lines for GM's Sierra and Silverado trucks for the 1995 model year.
William Carroll, president of Hayes-Dana, said the contracts will help offset the loss of frame sales resulting from Ford Motor Co.'s decision to phase out production of F-Series trucks starting in 1996.
