CPC International Inc. said it exercised an option to buy a 50% equity stake in a subsidiary of Tongaat-Hulett Group Ltd. of South Africa for about $20 million.
The unit, Tongaat Consumer Foods, will be renamed CPC Tongaat Foods, and will continue to market CPC and Tongaat-Hulett food products in South Africa and other countries in sub-Sahara Africa.
Last year, CPC and Tongaat-Hulett announced a licensing agreement that allowed Tongaat Consumer Foods to make and market some of CPC's branded food products.
CPC, an Englewood Cliffs, N.J., consumer foods company, said CPC Tongaat Foods sales should be more than $200 million this year.
