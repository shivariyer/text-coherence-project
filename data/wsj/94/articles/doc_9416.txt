Investors poured more than $20 billion into money-market mutual funds in the latest week, as taxable yields slipped and tax-free yields plummeted.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compound yield on taxable funds eased to 2.75% from 2.78% in the week ended Tuesday, according to Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass., newsletter.
The average seven-day compound yield on tax-exempt funds plunged to 1.74% from 2.36%, the newsletter reported.
The latest tax-free average, a near-record low, is equivalent to a taxable 2.72% for investors in the 36% tax bracket and to 2.88% for someone paying 39.6% in taxes.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
Assets of 635 taxable funds rose by $15.74 billion to $489.18 billion, according to Money Fund Report.
Most of that inflow -- $13.73 billion -- went to 195 funds open only to institutional investors.
Individuals added just over $2 billion to the remaining taxable funds.
Assets of 339 tax-exempt funds grew by $6.32 billion, including $1.35 billion in institutional money.
"It's a seasonal pattern," said Walter Frank, chief economist for Money Fund Report.
Assets of money funds typically rise in January as investors deposit annual pension and other retirement-plan contributions, and year-end bonuses.
Yields often decline because of a reduced supply of short-term securities at the start of the year, which pushes up prices.
This is most acutely felt by tax-free funds, because short-term municipal securities are in particularly short supply.
The average seven-day simple yield on taxable funds slid to 2.71% from 2.75% in the latest week, Money Fund Report said.
The average 30-day simple yield remained at 2.72%, and the average 30-day compound yield inched up to 2.76% from 2.75%.
Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments, which include commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and Treasury bills, lengthened by one day to 59 days.
Average maturity of the tax-free funds shortened by two days to 58 days.
