The percentage of full-time workers who earn low wages increased significantly between 1979 and 1992, with younger and less-educated Americans hit the hardest.
A Census Bureau study found that about 18% of the nation's 81 million year-round, full-time workers earned less than $13,091 a year in 1992, a 50% increase over the 12% who had low earnings in 1979.
For young workers between the ages of 18 to 24 and 25 to 34, the percentages who were low-wage earners doubled in the period, to 47% and 18%, respectively.
The Census Bureau's low-earnings threshold is a modified version of the poverty level for a four-person family with two children, which is $14,228 a year.
The study also found that low earners tend to be female and less educated.
However, the study found that the likelihood of having low earnings has risen faster among men than women.
The proportion of women with low earnings increased 16% over the period, while the proportion of men with low earnings jumped 83%.
That the percentage of low-income, full-time workers has risen so sharply is a concern.
The Census Bureau says the mere prospect of low wages may encourage adults to stay out of the labor force altogether.
