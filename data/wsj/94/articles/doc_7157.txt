David K. Klotz, 44 years old, sole proprietor of Dialogue International, a sales and marketing consulting concern, was elected a director of this provider of data processing, accounting and recordkeeping services for financial institutions.
He succeeds Norman Shallan, who died in July.
Also, James Howley, who served a special one-year term on the company's board last year, wasn't renominated.
This reduces the board to five members.
