Iroquois Bancorp Inc. said the Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed that its former president, Robert J. Steigerwald, is the subject of an investigation.
Mr. Steigerwald, who stepped down as president of Iroquois and its Cayuga Savings Bank subsidiary last November at age 55, said he was unaware of an investigation.
"I've never been contacted by the FBI," he said.
In Syracuse, N.Y., Lester L. Amann, supervisor of the FBI office there, confirmed that an investigation of Mr. Steigerwald, involving his former role at Iroquois, is under way.
Iroquois made its disclosure after the Citizen, an Auburn newspaper, published an article on Cayuga.
Iroquois said the report prompted the company to confirm that an FBI probe "is focused primarily on Mr. Steigerwald."
Iroquois gave no details of the probe.
Joseph P. Ganey, chairman, president and chief executive of Iroquois, says Mr. Steigerwald, though no longer president, continues to be paid through this month.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday Iroquois shares closed at $16, down 75 cents, or 4.5%.
