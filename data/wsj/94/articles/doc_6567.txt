Value City Department Stores Inc. said sales for the four weeks ended Saturday fell 7.3% to $33 million from $35.6 million a year ago.
Sales at stores open for at least a year decreased 9.1%, the company said.
However, total sales for the 26 weeks ended Saturday rose 2.9% to $487.1 million from $473.6 million.
The company attributed the decline in monthly sales to the effects of the severe winter weather in the Midwest and Northeast, where its stores are located.
Value City operates a chain of 75 full-line, discount department stores.
