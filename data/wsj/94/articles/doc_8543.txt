Major Canadian wage settlements reached in November provided increases averaging 0.1% annually, the federal labor department said.
The figure was the smallest recorded since 1978 when the labor department began collecting the data.
More than 90% of employees covered by the November settlements were subject to wage freezes.
Settlements in October provided an average annual increase of 2.3% and September settlements provided for an average 0.2% increase.
