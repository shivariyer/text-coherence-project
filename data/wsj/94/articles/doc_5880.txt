California's Department of General Services signed a three-year "master contract" with Pacific Telesis Group unit Pacific Bell, Compression Labs Inc. and Tele-Images Inc. for videoconferencing equipment, network and system integration services, training and maintenance.
Pacific Bell said the contract could be worth as much as $10 million, depending on how quickly the network grows and the number of systems the state buys.
