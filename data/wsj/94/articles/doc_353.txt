The Japanese government plans to purchase a 13 billion yen to 14 billion yen ($124.9 million to $134.5 million) EP-3 reconnaissance airplane from Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., a foreign ministry official said.
The official said the four-propeller plane is accounted for in the budget for the fiscal year ending March 31, and said he would look for a March 1996 delivery.
The government has already taken delivery of two such planes for its Self Defense Forces and has another plane on order.
A Kawasaki Heavy Industries official indicated the company already factored the expected order into its earnings forecast.
