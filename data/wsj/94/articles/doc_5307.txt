Wall Street's big winner in the takeover battle for Paramount Communications Inc. shapes up as Smith Barney Shearson Inc., which stands to reap fees of between $25 million and $30 million.
Smith Barney's $12.5 million fee for advising Viacom Inc. on the original $8.2 billion friendly Paramount-Viacom merger last September was threatened by the hostile takeover bid by QVC Network Inc.
But the Travelers Inc. unit and its new chief executive officer, former Morgan Stanley & Co. mergers ace Robert Greenhill, bounced back by not only winning the Paramount battle, but also by advising Viacom on an additional $8.4 billion friendly takeover of Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. negotiated in January.
Although fees for the Blockbuster deal haven't been disclosed, Smith Barney is expected to receive roughly the same size fee for that deal as the Paramount transaction, plus an additional fee for negotiating a $1.2 billion investment in Viacom by Nynex Corp.
Blockbuster was represented by Merrill Lynch & Co., and Viacom was also advised on the Paramount deal by Bear, Stearns & Co. and Goldman, Sachs & Co.
Lazard Freres & Co. also stands to receive $12.5 million for advising Paramount.
Although QVC had to spend $32 million on legal fees and bank commitment fees, its investment banker, Allen & Co., said it wouldn't bill QVC for any fees if QVC didn't acquire Paramount.
The firm of Wasserstein Perella & Co., which once dominated the merger rankings in the late 1980s, missed out on counting the Paramount deal in its 1994 totals because it was advising BellSouth Corp. on its investment in QVC.
