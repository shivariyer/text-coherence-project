An inadequate tracking and tracing system and an ill-equipped transportation system are preventing the U.S. Postal Service from delivering priority mail in two days.
Marvin Runyon, U.S. Postmaster General, told a Senate subcommittee last week that the postal service is continuing to eliminate traces of its advertising campaign which misled customers into believing priority mail was guaranteed to be delivered in two days when it wasn't.
Mr. Runyon added that during the past year the agency failed to deliver priority mail within two days.
Currently, only 84% of priority mail reaches its destination on the second day.
"Right now priority mail is just heavier weight first-class mail," said James Van Loozen, spokesman for the postal service.
"We can't call it guarantee service until we can get the delivery numbers into the high 90s."
Mr. Runyon has ordered that priority mail envelopes that carry a two-day message be destroyed, and signs and posters be removed.
Mr. Van Loozen said "clerks have been instructed to tell customers there is no guarantee."
