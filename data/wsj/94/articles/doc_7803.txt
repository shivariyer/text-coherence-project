Strength in the bond market and a solid snapback in beleaguered utility stocks cleared the way for gains in stocks.
Weakness in bonds, and worrisome technical factors -- including a tumbling Dow Jones Utilities Average -- had helped knock stocks lower in the previous two sessions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which Tuesday posted its biggest decline of 1994, added 12.66, or 0.33%, to 3,908.00.
It is back within easy striking distance of the record 3,914.48 that was set Friday.

Edward Nicoski, a market analyst at Piper Jaffray, said the positive action in bonds and utilities eased some investors' worries that interest rates could climb.
The improvement in utilities, though, wasn't enough to convince analysts that investors' recent worries about the market are over.
Piper's Mr. Nicoski said he will need to see more evidence that the market's strength is broadening before he will be convinced the market can move decidedly higher.
While the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 4% year to date, aided by surging cyclicals, broader indexes have risen only about 1%.
"The Dow industrial average is going to new highs and a lot of investors are shrugging their shoulders and wondering why they aren't making money," he said.
Stocks were pushed back and forth several times during the day by program trading.
Recent volatility such as yesterday's -- partly caused by programs -- is another sign the market is weakening, said Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott.
The consistent buying that pushed stocks steadily higher earlier this month, he said, has been replaced by intermittent buying and selling, and more of a zigzag pattern for the market.
