Danish new-vehicle registrations rose 63.2% in February 1994 compared with a year earlier, to 10,953 from 6,711 units, said Danmarks Statistik, the Danish statistical agency.
According to the statistics agency, the rise correlates with the upswing in the Danish economy, which has begun to show signs of moving out of recession in the past two months.
The largest rise was recorded in the new-car category, backing up the Danish government's hopes that household spending is on the rise.
