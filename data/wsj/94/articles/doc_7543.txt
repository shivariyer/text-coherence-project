American Telephone & Telegraph Co. posted a slight decline in fourth-quarter net income because of onetime charges, but across-the-board growth in its businesses generated strong revenue and operating profits.
While AT&T's gains met analysts' expectations, improvements in the company's long-distance business and in network equipment sales were unusually robust, given fierce competition in both sectors.
AT&T's NCR Corp. computer unit, moreover, rebounded with an operating profit and a 21% increase in equipment sales.
Fourth-quarter net fell 2% to $982 million, or 72 cents a share, from $1 billion, or 75 cents a share, a year ago, reflecting a reduction of $167 million, or 13 cents a share, because of an accounting change for benefits and a restructuring charge at NCR.
Without the charge, net income would have risen 15%.
Revenue grew 5.5% to $18.46 billion from $17.5 billion.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, AT&T gained 75 cents to $56.75.
AT&T's long-distance revenue increased 2% in the quarter to $9.92 billion and rose nearly 1% in the year to $39.86 billion, a showing that AT&T attributed to traffic gains in the toll-free calling market and an increase in consumer business.
Calling traffic grew slightly more than 6% in the quarter -- the unit's best performance in a year and a half -- and rose 5.5% in the year.
PaineWebber analyst Jack B. Grubman estimated AT&T's consumer traffic alone grew 5% in the quarter, a significant boost "when they had been running zero to 1% through all of 1993."
He added that AT&T's new True Rewards consumer plan, aimed at derailing MCI Communications Corp.'s Friends & Family program, is running "double their expectations" in terms of customer sign-ups.
"This was probably AT&T's strongest quarter ever," Mr. Grubman said, noting that AT&T's operating margin of 10.4% was a record for the company.
"Its two engines, long-distance and network systems, are really cranking."
Tony Ferrugia, an analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons, St. Louis, had expected 5% growth rather than the 8% growth AT&T showed in equipment sales for the year.
"They're well-positioned for the next three to five years," said Mr. Ferrugia, who two weeks ago improved his rating on AT&T stock to a "buy" from a "hold."
"It was a solid quarter across our lines of business," said Richard Miller, AT&T's chief financial officer.
He noted that sales of network equipment showed strength, gaining 22% outside the U.S.
In the full year, however, AT&T had a $3.79 billion, or $2.80 a share, net loss because of one-time charges.
They included noncash charges of $7 billion for retiree health benefits and $1.3 billion for separation and disability payments.
That was partially offset by a $383 million gain from an accounting change affecting income taxes, AT&T said.
The full-year loss compared with net income of $3.8 billion, or $2.86 a share, a year ago.
Revenue grew 3.5% to $67.16 billion from $64.9 billion.
Excluding the charges and a previously announced restructuring at NCR, AT&T said net income would have risen 12% to $4.26 billion, or $3.15 a share.
While AT&T's costs grew in the quarter and the year 5% and 2%, respectively, they declined as a percent of revenue.
Total costs were $11.2 billion in the quarter and $40.57 billion for the year.
Overall product sales, including phone equipment, computers and chips, grew almost 11% to $5.88 billion in the quarter and 8% in the year to $17.8 billion.
Within that sector, network equipment sales rose almost 11% to $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter.
Sales of communications products to businesses and consumers rose 12.5% in the quarter to $1.13 billion, and were up 11% to $3.44 billion in the year.
At NCR, which this week changed its name to AT&T Global Information Solutions, sales of computer systems rose 20% to $1.26 billion in the quarter, and the company's total revenue rose 7% to $2.3 billion.
In the year, NCR's total revenue grew 2% to $7.26 billion.
Excluding restructuring charges of about $120 million, the Dayton, Ohio, computer unit posted operating profit of $61 million for the quarter, despite the economic slump in Europe and Japan.
Financial services revenue climbed 23% in the quarter to $712 million and rose 32% to $2.5 billion in the year, AT&T said.
PaineWebber's Mr. Grubman estimated the Universal Credit Card, with 17 million cards in the market, accounted for about half of the revenue.
