The main shareholders in the collapsed Bank of Credit & Commerce International will pay $100 million more in compensation to depositors, banking officials close to the case said yesterday.
The banking officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified, confirmed reports from London about a new deal between Touche Ross, the international liquidators for BCCI, and the bank's Abu Dhabi shareholders.
The agreement in principle involves payment of $1.8 billion toward compensating the 250,000 BCCI creditors who lost their money when regulators moved against the bank in London and other major capitals in July 1991 on charges of massive fraudulent dealings.
The Al Nahyan ruling family of Abu Dhabi held 77% of the stock of the bank, which operated in 69 countries.
"The talks have been concluded.
A new agrement has been reached between representatives of the majority shareholders and Touche Ross in principle, but details of the new agreement are not yet revealed," said one of the officials.
