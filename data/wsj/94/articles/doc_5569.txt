Raytheon Co., citing defense-spending cutbacks, said it cut about 550 jobs, or about 1% of its work force, in its missile-systems and defense-equipment divisions.
The aerospace, electronics and defense concern said it eliminated the manufacturing, engineering and marketing positions because government defense spending continues to decline.
Raytheon, Lexington, Mass., employs about 63,000 people world-wide.
The affected positions were in Massachusetts.
