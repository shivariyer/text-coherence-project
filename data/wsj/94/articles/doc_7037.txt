Marine Midland Banks Inc. said fourth-quarter profit jumped 27%, helped by wider profit margins between borrowing and lending rates and a drop in the cost of bad debts.
The Buffalo, N.Y., bank, which has $18 billion in assets, is owned by HSBC Holdings PLC of London.
Marine Midland posted net income of $45.4 million, compared with year-earlier net of $35.7 million.
For the full year, the bank reported net income of $173.2 million, up 59% from 1992 results of $109.2 million.
Marine reduced expenses by 11% last year while increasing the so-called net interest margin between borrowing rates and yields on loans and investments.
The margin widened to 4.93 percentage points in the fourth quarter from 4.39 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 1992.
The company didn't set aside a provision for bad debts in the quarter; in the year-earlier period, the provision was $3.4 million.
For the year, however, the provision climbed to $115 million, from $73.2 million in 1992.
