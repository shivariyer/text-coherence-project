A federal grand jury here indicted three individuals in connection with a bribery scheme at General Electric Co. that was aimed at influencing the Israeli government into purchasing GE military jet engines.
One of the men indicted was Herbert Steindler, 55 years old, who was a GE international sales manager at the time.
Mr. Steindler, who was fired by GE in 1991, couldn't be reached for comment.
Others indicted were Rami Dotan, 49, a former Israeli Air Force general who oversaw the purchase and maintenance of aircraft engines; and Harold Katz, 72, an attorney in Israel who laundered the funds through European bank accounts.
The indictments were announced by the U.S. Justice Department.
GE has already pleaded guilty, and in 1992 the Fairfield, Conn., company paid $69 million in fines and penalties to settle charges of conspiracy, money laundering, and failure to make and keep accurate books and records.
The scheme involved diverting funds from defense contracts between GE and the government of Israel, which were financed under a U.S. foreign military-aid program.
According to the indictment, between 1984 and 1990 about $11 million was diverted.
