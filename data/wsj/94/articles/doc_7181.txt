Michael J. Conway, the deposed chief executive officer of America West Airlines, has resigned from the carrier's board, reducing the number of directors to nine.
Mr. Conway, one of the company's founders, was ousted as chief executive on New Year's Eve, culminating a feud with America West Chairman William A. Franke.
Mr. Conway had previously said he would stay on the board to help the airline emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, where it has operated for almost three years.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Conway declined comment on why he resigned.
It is known, however, that the 48-year-old Mr. Conway is talking to possible investor groups in America West, and people familiar with the situation say Mr. Conway would like to return to the airline after it emerges from Chapter 11 with new ownership.
Mr. Conway declined to comment on his future plans.
