The March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation is launching a television and radio campaign to urge prospective mothers to take folic acid, a B vitamin, to prevent so-called neural tube birth defects.
The campaign follows a recent Food and Drug Administration decision allowing makers of dietary supplements to claim that folic acid could reduce defects such as spina bifida, a leading cause of childhood paralysis.
At a speech sponsored by the March of Dimes here, FDA Commissioner David Kessler said women of childbearing age should take 0.4 milligrams of folic acid a day by taking a multivitamin, or eating five servings of green, leafy vegetables, beans and citrus fruits a day.
Studies have shown that an estimated 50% of serious defects of the brain, skull and spine known as neural-tube defects can be prevented each year if women in the U.S. consumed this amount of folic acid prior to conception and during the early months of pregnancy.
Each year, an estimated 2,500 babies are born with these defects in the U.S.
