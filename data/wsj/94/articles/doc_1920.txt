ARKLA Inc., Houston, said it plans to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission on an offering of $100 million in common stock.
The natural-gas concern said it expects to file a statement with the SEC before the end of the first quarter.
Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it will review Arkla's credit ratings for a possible upgrade.
The rating concern cited Arkla's plan to issue equity and reduce debt.
Ratings under review are Ba2 for senior unsecured debt and B1 for preferred stock, Moody's said, with about $1.8 billion in obligations affected.
