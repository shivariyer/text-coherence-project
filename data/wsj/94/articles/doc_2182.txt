USAir Group Inc. said it is in violation of a net worth covenant related to a loan agreement and is seeking a waiver.
The airline said it had $300 million available in loan commitments under the bank credit agreement.
USAir, or Arlington, Va., also said it is seeking a waiver on a similar violation of an agreement to sell as much as $140 million in accounts receivables.
USAir said none of the money has been borrowed, and until waivers are obtained, it won't be able to get funds under the bank credit or receivable agreements.
"In the past, we've always received waivers," said a USAir spokesman.
The disclosure comes as USAir is trying to persuade its unions to agree to big wage and work-rule concessions.
Those talks began last week after USAir, facing growing competition from lower-cost airlines, projected a wider loss for 1994.
The company turned to the unions for help in a plan to slash operating costs by as much as 9%, or roughly $608 million a year.
The unions plan to meet today in Washington to discuss the request.
