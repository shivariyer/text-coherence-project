Canada's National Energy Board approved Interprovincial Pipe Line Inc.'s plan to expand its pipeline system for delivering crude oil to U.S. pipelines supplying the U.S. Midwest.
The board said Interprovincial will be able to construct about 304 miles of 20-inch diameter pipeline across the Canadian Prairies, reactivate an idle pipeline and expand its oil pumping facilities.
It said Interprovincial plans to spend 256 million Canadian dollars ($193.3 million) on the pipeline expansion this year.
The board predicted that under oil-price assumptions provided by Interprovincial, the project would stimulate production of Canadian crude oil that would otherwise be difficult to transport, and that it would improve the competitive position of Canadian crude oil deliveries to the U.S. Midwest.
Interprovincial, Edmonton, Alberta, is a unit of Interprovincial Pipe Line System Inc., also of Edmonton.
