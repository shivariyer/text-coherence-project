A federal jury convicted disbarred attorney James H. O'Hagan on charges that he illegally profited from inside information about Grand Metropolitan PLC's plans to acquire Pillsbury Co. in 1988.
Mr. O'Hagan, now 57 years old, was at the time serving as a partner in the prominent law firm of Dorsey & Whitney.
Federal prosecutors charged that he acquired nonpublic information when the law firm was acting as local counsel on behalf of Grand Met.
The attorney bought a substantial quantity of Pillsbury shares months in advance of the British company's buyout bid, and reaped $4.3 million in profit after the bid became public.
The jury deliberated for more than two days, the U.S. Attorney's office said, before finding Mr. O'Hagan guilty on a total of 57 counts of securities fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering.
Mr. O'Hagan contended that he never possessed any inside information, and that the Pillsbury stock purchases were an investment based on widespread speculation at the time that Pillsbury would come into play in the late-1980s takeover binge.
Neither he nor his attorney could be reached for comment late yesterday.
Dorsey & Whitney hasn't been linked to any wrongdoing in the Pillsbury matter.
Mr. O'Hagan, prosecutors contend, "used a portion of the profits from the sale of the Pillsbury securities to conceal his previous embezzlement of an estimated $1 million from client-trust funds."
In 1990, Mr. O'Hagan was convicted in state court on theft charges, and disbarred, for taking money from trust accounts; those funds were repaid.
