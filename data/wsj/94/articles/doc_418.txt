Silas Keehn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago, said he plans to retire this summer.
Mr. Keehn noted that he will be 64 years old, and will have served for 13 years as president of the bank, at the end of June.
"It's just the right time for this transition to take place," he said.
Unlike Federal Reserve Board governors, who are appointed by the White House and confirmed by the Senate, presidents of Federal Reserve district banks are appointed by the banks' directors, who come from the private sector.
Their appointments are subject to approval by the board of governors, however.
Presidents sit on the powerful Open Market Committee, along with Fed governors, to set interest rates.
As a group, the presidents are considered to be hawkish on pushing up rates to control inflation.
But Mr. Keehn's vote has been considered among the more moderate of the presidents regarding control of money-supply growth.
A bank spokeswoman said that when asked whether he's a hawk or a dove on inflation, the president "prefers to say he's an eagle."
The 12 district bank presidents are granted only five FOMC votes, although they attend and participate in all meetings.
Mr. Keehn voted last at the December 1993 meeting; the Chicago district isn't scheduled to resume official voting in the FOMC until January 1995.
The Chicago Reserve Bank includes all or parts of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Richard G. Cline, chairman of the district bank, and chairman, president and chief executive officer of gas-utility holding company Nicor Inc., said a search committee will be formed to select a new president.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said that Mr. Keehn "has done an excellent job," and that his counsel will be missed at the FOMC, "where he provided wise insights to policy."
