Standard & Poor's Corp. said it will add KeyCorp to its S&P 500 index following the completion of the bank holding company's merger with Society Corp., which shareholders approved yesterday.
The rating agency said the merger, expected to be completed by March 1, will have a market value of about $7 billion.
S&P said it will name the company to be removed from the index next week.
