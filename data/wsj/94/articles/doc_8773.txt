An investor group that includes Continental Bank's venture-capital affiliate signed a letter of intent to acquire Standard Rate & Data Service Inc. from the late Robert Maxwell's business empire.
Standard Rate & Data, a Wilmette, Ill., publisher of reference information used by advertising agencies, is a unit of London-based Maxwell Communication Corp., which is in bankruptcy-law proceedings.
Continental Illinois Venture Corp., the Continental Bank affiliate, said the purchase price is between $50 million and $70 million.
The transaction is expected to be completed by March 31.
Price Waterhouse, the court-appointed administrator, said Standard Rate & Data is the last significant piece of Maxwell Communication's U.S. assets to be sold.
Price Waterhouse said it will write Maxwell Communication's creditors by the end of the month to announce the result of the asset sales.
It added that the Standard Rate & Data deal will bring asset sales to more than $1.5 billion.
