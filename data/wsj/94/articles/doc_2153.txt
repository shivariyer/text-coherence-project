The Wall Street Journal Europe and Gazeta Wyborcza launched a weekly Polish-language business-news section containing articles from the Journal for the Polish newspaper.
The supplement consists primarily of articles, translated into Polish, from The Wall Street Journal Europe, with additional articles from The Asian Wall Street Journal and The Wall Street Journal, published by Dow Jones & Co.
Gazeta, which is Poland's largest daily newspaper and prints more than 500,000 copies daily, included the inaugural 16-page supplement in Monday's editions.
Karen Elliott House, vice president, international, of Dow Jones, said the weekly section "allows us to provide Journal news to Central Europe's largest economy, with the region's fastest-growing private sector."
Last week, Dow Jones announced agreements with eight newspapers in Latin America to provide them with a Spanish-language business-news section.
The section will be published in the morning editions of the newspapers Monday through Friday and will consist of news from The Wall Street Journal.
In addition to the Journal and its international editions, Dow Jones publishes Barron's magazine and other periodicals, electronic business-information services, including Dow Jones Telerate, and community newspapers.
