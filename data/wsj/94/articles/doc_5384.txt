ABC News said it reprimanded two employees who staged a scene for a news report Jan. 26.
The report, which aired on "World News Tonight with Peter Jennings," showed correspondent Cokie Roberts, wearing a coat, in front of an electronically imposed Capitol Hill scene.
Mr. Jennings, unaware that Ms. Roberts was actually in a studio, several times told viewers that she was live at the Capitol.
Ms. Roberts wore the coat at the request of the newscast's executive producer, Rick Kaplan.
Both Mr. Kaplan and Ms. Roberts were reprimanded.
ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., said the incident was a mistake.
"Even though it had no editorial effect, the action was serious because it misled our audience," said Richard Wald, senior vice president, in a memo to ABC News staff.
