Euro Disney SCA stock jumped 4.3%, thanks to a strong outlook for attendance at the company's theme park on the outskirts of Paris.
Shares in the park and hotel operator closed at 36.2 francs ($6.14), up 1.5 francs.
Traders in Paris said the stock received a boost from a report yesterday morning in The Wall Street Journal Europe that the park is enjoying strong attendance and that tour operators predict growing sales of Euro Disney holiday packages.
But analysts expressed skepticism about the shares, saying buyers may be misled if they view strong attendance as a panacea for the park's problems.
"It's a bit like a theater show -- sometimes people go in to see it when they hear it's about to close," said Nigel Reed of Paribas Capital Markets in London.
Instead, Mr. Reed said, investors should await news on the restructuring of Euro Disney's troubled finances.
Euro Disney is in talks with its bankers and Walt Disney Co., which owns 49% of the European company's shares.
"Almost any reorganization plan possible would dilute the stock dramatically," noted Jack Hersch, research director at M.J. Whitman in New York.
Euro Disney reported a loss of 5.3 billion francs for the year ended Sept. 30, including a one-time charge of 3.6 billion francs to write off the park's start-up costs.
