Punished by marketing mistakes, weakness in the apparel market and theft, 50-Off Stores Inc. said it expects to post a net loss for its fourth quarter ended Jan. 28 of between $2.2 million and $2.7 million, or up to 27 cents a share, based on preliminary results.
The loss, sharply below consensus analysts's estimates of earnings of seven cents a share for the quarter, as complied by Zacks Investment Research, sent 50-Off common shares down 62.5 cents to $5.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
The net loss would compare with net income of $800,000, or eight cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales for the quarter rose 11% to $68.6 million from $61.6 million, the company said.
For the fiscal year, the discount apparel retailer said it expects to report a net loss of about $9 million, or about 90 cents a share, compared with net income of $4.8 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier, despite a 10% rise in sales to $199.7 million from $181 million.
This year's results will include a pretax charge of $2.1 million from a change in accounting, said Pat L. Ross, chief financial officer.
Under that change, 50-Off wrote off all unamortized pre-opening store costs for the year in the just-ended fourth quarter.
In the future, the company said it will write off pre-opening costs in the first two months after a store opens, rather than in the first 12 months, as it had been doing.
Mr. Ross said 50-Off also was forced to take higher-than-expected markdowns, slashing gross profit margins, as the company revamped its apparel lines.
"We weren't carrying the brands our customers wanted at the prices they wanted to pay," he said.
"We're correcting our marketing focus, bringing in more branded goods, and better quality goods."
Mr. Ross also said that "shrinkage," or theft and other losses, worsened, forcing the company to take an additional $1.1 million reserve as a year-end adjustment.
The company will report final results for fiscal 1994 on March 3.
