Centocor Inc. said its chairman, Hubert J.P. Schoemaker, last week underwent successful surgery to remove a brain tumor.
The biotechnology company said the tumor was diagnosed following a routine physical exam on Feb. 22, and was completely removed on Feb. 24 at the University of Pennsylvania.
Dr. Schoemaker, 43 years old, continues to function as chairman, the company said.
"Following discussions with Hubert and his doctors, the outlook is very encouraging, and he expects to be back in the office very shortly," said David P. Holveck, president and chief executive.
