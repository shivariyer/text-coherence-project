German tire maker Continental AG has abandoned plans to build a new headquarters building, in a move to channel more funds into research and development.
Land acquisition and construction costs have risen since the headquarters idea was conceived in 1990, the company said.
At the same time, Germany's recession has forced the company to rethink its strategy, a spokesman said.
Plans called for an investment of 60 million to 80 million marks ($34 million to $46 million).
Since then, land costs have risen in the 30,000-square-meter site on the fast-developing outskirts of Hanover.
The project would now cost more than 100 million marks, the company said.
In August 1992, Continental sold its 14-floor headquarters in the city center.
About 450 of the administrative staff have moved into one of the company's unused tire factories in Hanover.
That building will now be the new headquarters.
