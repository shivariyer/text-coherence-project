Nielsen Media Research said it will increase by 25%, to 5,000, the number of households in the sample it uses to calculate national television ratings.
The sample, currently 4,000 households, provides nationwide audience estimates for the four broadcast networks, 32 cable networks and hundreds of syndicated shows.
Statistically, a larger sample will likely be of most benefit to small cable channels and syndicated shows.
With more households participating in the ratings survey, lesser-viewed programs are more apt to show up in the rankings.
And such programming won't be as vulnerable to the TV preferences of just one or two households.
The bigger sample will also make it easier to break down audience estimates into such demographic factors as age, gender and income, Nielsen said.
The company in its survey uses "people meters," small devices that let household members indicate when they are in a room where a TV is on, providing Nielsen with demographic information.
The expansion will begin in September and take two years to complete.
Nielsen is a unit of Dun & Bradstreet Corp.
