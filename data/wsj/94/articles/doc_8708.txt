From a distance, it looks like jumbo jets at the local airport here are lined up thicker than LaGuardia at rush hour.
And while the planes at that busy New York airport sometimes seem to go nowhere fast, they've got nothing on the DC-10s and 727s here.
That's because Amarillo International Airport has become one of the busiest airplane parking lots in the country.
As carriers ground aging and underused jets, they have parked many at the three-year-old storage facility operated by DynAir Tech, a unit of the aircraft-maintenance company DynCorp. in Reston, Va.
DynAir is caring for 50 aircraft here, from American, Delta and other airlines, and it expects 20 more in the next six months.
That makes aircraft storage one of the few expanding segments of aviation and explains why DynAir has increased its work force here to 150 from three in just three years of operation.
"It's an active area right now, but I wouldn't call it a growing business," says Paul Hannak, DynAir's senior vice president for business development.
"It's not something any of us like to see.
We'd like to see the aircraft operating."
Amarillo is an ideal spot for sidelined airliners, Mr. Hannak says: Its dry, moderate climate is gentle on planes.
Moreover, the Amarillo airport used to be an Air Force base, so it has a runway long enough to accommodate jumbo jets, and plenty of room for expanded storage.
