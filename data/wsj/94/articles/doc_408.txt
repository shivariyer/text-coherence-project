General Magic Inc., a software consortium that includes the world's biggest telecommunications and consumer-electronics concerns, has hired investment bankers to begin planning for an initial public offering, industry sources confirmed.
The company declined comment on its plans for an IPO, reported yesterday in the San Francisco Chronicle.
But software executives said the consortium has hired Goldman, Sachs & Co., Smith Barney Shearson and Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. to underwrite the offering, the timing of which hasn't yet been determined.
The company is developing communications software, called Telescript, that links together disparate computers and other devices, and allows the use of programmable agents that will automatically perform tasks for users of an electronic network, such as finding and filtering information.
General Magic, based in Mountain View, Calif., is also developing an operating system, called Magic Cap, that facilitates the use of Telescript.
Devices using these technologies are expected on the market in late summer or early fall, as is a national network operated by American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
Nine companies own slightly more than half of General Magic: AT&T, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, Fujitsu Ltd., Toshiba Corp., Sony Corp., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Philips Electronics NV, Motorola Inc. and Apple Computer Inc.
The rest of the shares are owned by managers.
None of the partners or managers plan to sell their shares in the offering, industry executives said.
