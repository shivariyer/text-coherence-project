FirstFed Michigan Corp. said it will take a one-time restructuring charge of between $135 million and $145 million in the first quarter that will result in a loss for the year.
The Detroit-based bank-holding company said the restructuring "is designed to increase future core earnings."
FirstFed said there are two components to its restructuring.
First is a $750 million to $1 billion reduction in the wholesale segment of FirstFed's balance sheet and its related hedges.
The second component is a change in accounting for goodwill, which substantially eliminates the company's goodwill balance and the related amortization expense going forward.
In 1993, FirstFed had net income of $41.4 million, or $2.21 a share.
The announcement was made after the close of trading.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, FirstFed slipped 50 cents to $21.625.
