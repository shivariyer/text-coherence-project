Asarco Inc. said it has sold its remaining 45.3% interest in Asarco Australia Ltd. for $79.5 million.
The sale of Asarco's 66.5 million shares in the company will result in a pretax gain of $58.7 million, Asarco said.
The mining and chemical concern said it will use proceeds from the sale to reduce debt.
Asarco Australia, a separate publicly traded company, operates two gold mines in Western Australia that produced about 110,000 troy ounces of gold in 1992.
