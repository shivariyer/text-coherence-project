United Kingdom airport administrator BAA PLC said its seven airports handled 5.3 million passengers in February, an increase of 5.9% on February 1993.
Traffic at its two biggest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, increased 7.4% and 0.4%, respectively, BAA said.
BAA said its Scottish airports all recorded growth with the exception of Aberdeen, which was hurt by bad weather.
Domestic traffic rose 5%, European scheduled traffic rose 6% and Irish traffic rose 9%.
The long-haul sector rose 15%, but North Atlantic traffic fell 3% as a result of severe weather disruptions on the U.S. East Coast.
