Ohio Casualty Corp. said it expects claims from the severe winter weather in the Midwest and Northeast in January to cut first-quarter earnings by 38 cents a share.
The company said it has received some 4,200 claims to date because of winter storms; the majority of the claims involved property damage.
In the year-ago quarter, the company earned $19.8 million, or $1.10 a share.
