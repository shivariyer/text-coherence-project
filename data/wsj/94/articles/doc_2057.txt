Two Northeastern utilities said they reached an agreement to transfer nitrogen-oxide emissions credits, a move that could provide a framework for a regional emissions-reduction program.
Under the joint proposal, Public Service Electric & Gas Co. would reduce its output of nitrogen oxide at its energy facilities sooner than required by law and sell the "excess emission" credits through an intermediary to Northeast Utilities, Hartford, Conn., from 1995 to 1999.
Clean Air Action Corp., Tulsa, Okla., would facilitate the transaction, providing as much as $1.5 million to PSE&G, a unit of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., to help pay for the emissions reductions.
In turn, Clean Air Action would "retire" some emissions credits and sell the remainder to Northeast Utilities.
Northeast Utilities said it would use the credits to allow businesses in its service territory "more flexibility" to meet regulatory emissions standards.
The proposed interstate trading program derives from the 1990 Clean Air Act, which mandates a regional approach to nitrogen-oxide emission reduction.
In the Northeast, the Ozone Transport Commission and other groups, in conjunction with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have been formulating plans to reduce nitrogen-oxide emissions.
