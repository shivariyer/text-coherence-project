Amgen Inc. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced a long-term research collaboration in the biological sciences.
Under the pact, Amgen, a biotechnology company, will spend as much as $3 million a year for as long as 10 years in exchange for certain patent and technology rights resulting from the research.
"This university-industry collaboration will advance the already rapid pace of scientific discoveries in biology and other sciences," said Charles M. Vest, president of MIT in Cambridge, Mass.
