USBancorp Inc., Johnstown, Pa., said its proposed $43.6 million acquisition of Johnstown Savings Bank will proceed.
Under terms of an agreement between the two banks, Johnstown Savings Bank had until Feb. 17 to find a higher bidder.
Since no third party with a higher bid emerged, the two banks said the transaction would go forward.
The "marketing period" stemmed from USBancorp's amended bid for Johnstown of $22.50 a share.
USBancorp originally offered $24.50 a share, but negotiated to lower the bid while Johnstown sought other bidders.
The bid is a combination of cash and stock.
The acquisition is expected to close in June, though the pact still must meet certain stock-performance provisions.
