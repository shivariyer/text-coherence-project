McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. is behind schedule on rolling out a long-awaited wireless data communications service, and expects to be six months late in offering the service in all of its cellular-phone markets.
McCaw, of Kirkland, Wash., hoped to have the service running in six markets by the end of January and have all 105 of its U.S. service territories operating by midyear.
Instead, the company has three cities running currently and now expects to complete the rollout by the end of the year, spokesman Bob Ratliffe said.
The service, known as cellular digital packet data, or CDPD, is a high-profile contender in the race to offer wireless transmission services to pocket-size computers and communications devices.
CDPD makes use of the transmission towers and switching equipment used with cellular voice calls, offering a potential cost savings over data services that require completely new facilities.
McCaw, which had announced one earlier snag in delivering CDPD, laid most of the blame for the latest delay on suppliers of transmission equipment, which it wouldn't identify.
"We planned our projections based on when people said they could get us the gear," Mr. Ratliffe said.
"We just can't get our hands on it."
Analysts said the delay, while not likely to have a big financial impact on McCaw, would be a boost to the marketing efforts of two competing data services -- Ardis, a joint venture of Motorola Inc. and International Business Machines Corp., and RAM Mobile Data, owned by BellSouth Corp. of Atlanta and RAM Broadcasting of Woodbridge, N.J.
Some potential customers of both services have held off in signing up, preferring to wait and evaluate CDPD.
"The big problem for CDPD is that it has been overhyped and underproduced," said Andrew Seybold, a market analyst in Boulder Creek, Calif., who criticized the CDPD hoopla.
