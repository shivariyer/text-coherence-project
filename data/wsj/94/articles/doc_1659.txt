Saddled with a 91-day supply of unsold cars, General Motors Corp.'s Saturn small-car subsidiary is cutting daily production 27% and slowing its plans for a second plant.
The production cut and the delay in expansion plans mark the latest in a series of setbacks for Saturn, GM's heavily promoted $5 billion effort to roll back gains in the U.S. by Japanese small cars.
Since last October, Saturn's monthly sales have run an average of about 30% behind monthly production.
February sales of 16,865 Saturns were flat with year-earlier levels despite a widely advertised lease deal.
At current levels, Saturn sales are on track to fall short of 300,000 a year, even before full availability of new rivals including the Dodge Neon and the redesigned Chevrolet Cavalier.
Saturn's managers now have no date to seek approval for a second factory from GM President John F. Smith Jr. or GM's directors, a Saturn spokesman said.
Only last January, Saturn officials paid bonuses to workers in honor of a slim, qualified profit for 1993, and William E. Hoglund, GM executive vice president, declared GM could decide by early March to build a second Saturn plant that boosted capacity to as much as 500,000 Saturns a year from 322,000.
But now, Saturn's goal is to shrink its backlog of unsold cars by one-third to a 61-day supply by the end of this month.
To do that, Saturn on Wednesday cut its daily production to 800 cars from 1,100 cars.
Saturn's 6,600 production workers will continue to get full wages, even though their daily work turns will be reduced to about seven hours from the normal 10.
Saturn production employees work four 10-hour shifts a week.
A Saturn spokesman said yesterday that planning for a second factory is continuing, but acknowledged Saturn hasn't decided whether to seek the full 500,000 vehicles-a-year capacity it once wanted.
Meanwhile, Saturn expects sales to increase as the number of U.S. Saturn dealers grows this year to 360 from 283 now, and exports increase.
Saturn also laid blame for its problems on bad weather and a shortage of railroad vehicle carriers that has hampered shipments throughout the auto industry this winter.
Altogether, the U.S. auto makers said they plan to build 258,469 cars and trucks this week, up 12.8% from the 229,194 vehicles built in the same week last year.
In February, the auto makers built 1,033,575 cars and trucks, an increase of 18.5% from 872,248 vehicles built a year earlier.
Separately, parts shortages created by a four-day strike at two GM brake plants in Dayton, Ohio, idled four more assembly plants yesterday.
In total, the strike idled seven assembly plants and 19,790 workers.
Analyst Stephen Girsky of PaineWebber Inc. estimated the lost production cost GM about $50 million in pretax earnings, some of which it can make up later.
The strike ended yesterday as the 3,000 striking workers at Dayton ratified a new local labor agreement.
Work resumed with the afternoon shift.
