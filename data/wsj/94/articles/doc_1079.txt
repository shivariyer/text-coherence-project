The Congressional Budget Office said the government could save money by redesigning the Treasury's savings bond program to include a penalty for early redemptions.
The CBO said savings of $240 million could be achieved over the next five years by charging an interest penalty for early redemptions of savings bonds.
Specifically, the CBO said savings bond holders who redeem their bonds before five years could be charged a six-month interest penalty.
Such a change would require congressional action.
The CBO made its suggestion in a new report on deficit-reduction options.
A spokesman for the Treasury's Bureau of Public Debt, which includes the Savings Bond Division, said, "There is nothing like that under consideration."
