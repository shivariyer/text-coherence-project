In the latest round of personal computer discounting, Apple Computer Inc. announced discounts of 9% to 14% on its popular PowerBook line of portable computers.
Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said the discounts apply to the all-in-one PowerBook and two models of the PowerBook Duo.
The PowerBook 180 4/120, for example, is now $2,219, down 11% from its previous price of $2,499.
The PowerBook Duo 270c 12/240, with express modem, now sells for $3,299, down 9% from $3,619.
Apple's latest bid to boost its strong market share through lean prices, comes on the heels of a study by the research firm Dataquest, which rated the PowerBook Duo as the best selling so-called "subnotebook," or small portable computer, in both the U.S. and Europe.
