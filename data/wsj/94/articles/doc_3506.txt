Another House panel approved legislation that would let the regional Bell telephone companies manufacture telecommunications equipment and provide long-distance service.
The action by the House Judiciary Committee's Economic and Commercial Law subcommittee advances the bill to the full Judiciary Committee.
But the legislation is likely to be changed before the full panel acts, according to Judiciary Chairman Jack Brooks (D., Texas).
Mr. Brooks, one of the bill's authors, said he plans to meet soon to iron out changes with Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.), whose panel shares jurisdiction on the issue with the Judiciary Committee.
The legislation, a compromise worked out between Reps. Brooks and Dingell, is moving on a fast track, and they are trying to prevent their panels from diverging when they take it up.
On Tuesday, the Commerce Committee's telecommunications subcommittee approved it without making changes.
Mr. Brooks said there are "several areas in the long-distance area that I think need to be revisited with care and sensitivity."
