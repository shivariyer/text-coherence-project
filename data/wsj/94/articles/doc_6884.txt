Preussag AG, Hanover, Germany, reported a 56% plunge in fiscal 1993 profit and announced a management shakeup.
The metals and engineering concern said group profit dropped to 193 million marks ($111.3 million) in the year ended Sept. 30 from 440 million marks a year earlier.
The yearly dividend, however, will remain at 10 marks a share, the company said.
Preussag didn't elaborate on the profit decline, but the result partly reflects a previously announced loss of 103 million marks at the company's 51%-owned French subsidiary, MetalEurop SA.
Preussag previously reported that fiscal 1993 group sales fell 8.9% to 23.3 billion marks.
Meanwhile, Preussag said management board members Maximilian Ardelt and Siegfried Jaeck will step down immediately "by mutual agreement."
The departures are part of a general reorganization in Preussag's management board, a company spokesman said.
