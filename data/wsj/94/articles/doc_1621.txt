Information Resources Inc. named James G. Andress president and chief operating officer, succeeding Magid Abraham, who asked to be relieved of those executive duties because of a health problem.
The company wouldn't comment on the nature of Mr. Abraham's illness other than to say that it isn't life threatening.

Mr. Andress, 55, has been vice chairman and co-chief executive officer.
