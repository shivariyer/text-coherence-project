The Education Department said it now believes it has broken even in the insolvency of a student-loan guaranty agency that once was expected to cost taxpayers at least $26 million.
The agency, the High Education Assistance Foundation, became insolvent in 1990 as a result of defaults on high-risk loans it had backed.
But a transition foundation created after the insolvency was able to collect $300 million from defaulted loans.
That's more than the department predicted four years ago, and the amount equaled the Education Department's cost in phasing out the foundation.
The transition agency was supervised by the Student Loan Marketing Association.
