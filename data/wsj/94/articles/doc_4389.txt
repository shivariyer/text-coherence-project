Standard & Poor's Corp. downgraded this company's senior debt to triple-B-minus from triple-B and kept the ratings on its CreditWatch with negative implications.
About $185 million is affected.
The ratings agency said the downgrade stems in part from weaker earnings levels expected for the next few years.
Last week, the company said it would suspend its dividend and seek new long-term financing.

"We certainly understand, given our recent announcements," a Figgie spokesman said.

USF&G Corp. (Baltimore) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it upgraded the rating of USF&G's senior debt to Ba-1 from Ba-2.
About $590 million of securities is affected.
Moody's said the rating upgrade is based primarily on the company's improving core earnings, strengthened balance sheet and decreased financial leverage.
The ratings agency also confirmed at Baa-2 the financial strength rating of the company's main property/casualty subsidiary and at Baa-3 the rating of its life insurance unit.
