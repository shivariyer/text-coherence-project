Singer Co. said it received permission from Vietnamese authorities to begin operations at its sewing machine joint venture operation in Ho Chi Minh City.
Singer said the facility, which will have a production capacity of 250,000 sewing machines a year, also will assemble consumer durable products such as televisions and refrigerators.
Singer will have a controlling stake in the venture and will provide manufacturing technology and management.
The consumer product manufacturing and distribution concern said it also plans to establish a wholly owned retail distribution network in Vietnam, with its first store opening in the next few months.
It says it sees a network of about 100 stores within the next three to four years.
Singer declined to disclose the value of its investment in the manufacturing and retail projects.
