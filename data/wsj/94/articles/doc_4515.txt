Perkin-Elmer Corp. said it signed a letter of intent for the sale of its Metco surface technology division to Sulzer Ltd. of Switzerland.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Metco, which employs about 585 people, has annual sales of slightly more than $100 million.
The transaction requires regulatory clearance.
Metco makes thermal-spray materials and equipment for coating high-performance machine parts, for the aircraft, automobile and other industries.
Perkin-Elmer, based in Norwalk, Conn., said the sale is one of the final steps in its plan to "transform itself from a high-technology conglomerate to a focused analytical and biotechnology instrumentation company."
Sulzer's businesses include medical implants, weaving machinery and building services.
