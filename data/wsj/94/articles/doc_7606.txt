Shareholders of SoftKey Software Products Inc. approved the merger of the Toronto company with two U.S. software concerns, Wordstar International Inc. of Novato, Calif., and Boston-based Spinnaker Software Corp.
Under the terms of the complex combination of the three software concerns, SoftKey shareholders will receive 3.26 shares of Wordstar, which in turn will control all voting shares of the new entity, SoftKey International Inc.
The company expects to consolidate the Wordstar shares on a 10-for-1 basis once the merger is concluded.
SoftKey's chairman and chief executive officer, Michael Perik, said he expects the merger to receive final approval from a Canadian court and take effect next week.
