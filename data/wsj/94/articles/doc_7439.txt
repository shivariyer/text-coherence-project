Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd., Montreal, said it formed a company from its paperboard group and may issue stock in the unit if workers agree to cost-cutting measures needed to attract capital.
The new company, St. Laurent Paperboard Inc., will operate facilities in Quebec and Ontario with 1,400 employees and annual sales of about 308 million Canadian dollars (US$234.3 million).
CP Forest's paperboard group had an operating loss of C$11 million last year, but recent price increases for linerboard, used in corrugated boxes, have improved the outlook.
Separately, CP Forest said it had a loss of C$285.6 million, or C$4.88 a share in 1993, compared with a loss of C$248 million, or C$4.82 a share in 1992.
Sales were flat, at C$1.83 billion.
David Toole, chief financial officer, said the company expects a much narrower loss in 1994.
