Prudential Securities Inc. set aside more than $430 million in reserves in 1993 for limited-partnership legal claims, four times what the brokerage firm predicted a year ago.
Despite the reserves, the Prudential Insurance Co. of America unit managed to post 1993 net income of $145 million amid the boom in trading and underwriting on Wall Street, down just 3% from 1992.
For Wall Street, 1993 was such "an exceptionally good year that it's given many firms the opportunity to be very conservative in putting aside for rainy days -- whether those rainy days were in the past or in the future," said Michael Flanagan, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.
Separately, Salomon Inc. said 1993 net zoomed 50%, to $827 million, or $7.01 a share, from $550 million, or $4.18 a share.
The results were buoyed by a threefold jump in fourth-quarter net on strong gains in investment banking and proprietary trading.
The results, unexpected by Wall Street analysts, prompted a 5% jump in the shares of Salomon, parent of New York brokerage firm Salomon Brothers Inc.
Prudential's reserves bring to nearly $900 million the total legal tab for Prudential's soured partnerships during the past few years to deal with lawsuits by disgruntled investors.
The nation's fourth-largest brokerage firm already has paid out a total of $270 million in partnership claims.
Prudential's 1993 reserves are the highest ever set aside in a year by a Wall Street brokerage firm for legal claims involving small investors, analysts say.
The bulging reserves give the company a cushion to dole out payments from a $330 million reparations fund for investors, set up as part of an October settlement with federal and state regulators.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, along with the 50 states, has accused Prudential of widespread fraud in selling $8 billion of partnerships in the 1980s.
The 1993 reserves are "adequate to fund fully" the $330 million reparations fund, Prudential said.
But the reparations fund is open-ended -- depending on claims brought by investors -- and some analysts expect the final tally to be far higher.
Before taxes and reserves, Prudential had 1993 profit of a record $563 million, 48% higher than in 1992.
In the fourth quarter, pretax profit was $154 million, more than double the results of a year earlier.
Prudential's return on equity was 17% in 1993; its equity capital is $850 million.
Revenue rose 13% in 1993, to $3.4 billion.
Assets under management surged to a record $151 billion, up 11%.
Excess regulatory capital stood at $606 million at year end.
And despite a drumbeat of negative publicity, Prudential said it opened more than 20,000 new brokerage accounts each month in 1993, and hired more than 230 brokers.
Salomon's fourth-quarter net was $476 million, or $4.33 a share, up from $143 million, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier.
Per-share earnings were more than double analysts' expectations; its shares closed yesterday at $48.25, up $2.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Salomon's 1993 earnings, however, were dragged down by trading bets that backfired in the firm's third quarter.
The 50% jump in 1993 net was more in line with the strong annual results reported by many securities brokers.
For the fourth quarter, Salomon posted $508 million in pretax profit from its proprietary-trading operation.
But that operation had a $173 million loss in the third quarter, offsetting the strong performances by its brokerage and investment banking lines.
In the year-earlier quarter, proprietary trading accounted for $482 million of pretax profit.
Revenue from investment banking in the quarter, amid a raging Wall Street underwriting boom, more than doubled to $250 million from $104 million in the yearearlier quarter.
Commissions rose to $79 million from the prior year's $51 million in the fourth quarter.
Salomon's total fourth-quarter revenue rose to $2.76 billion from $2.14 billion.
Its revenue also rose sharply quarter-to-quarter; third-quarter revenue was $1.86 billion.
Total revenue for 1993 was $8.8 billion, an 8% gain from the prior year's $8.18 billion.
