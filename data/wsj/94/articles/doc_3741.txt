Rhone-Poulenc Inc. said it received preliminary federal approval to use a salt-rinse solution in chicken processing that is nearly 100% effective at eliminating salmonella and some other bacteria that cause food-borne illnesses.
A spokesman for the National Broiler Council, a trade group of chicken producers and processors, said the council is "optimistic of a fairly rapid voluntary adoption of the process" by the industry.
Rhone-Poulenc is a unit of Rhone-Poulenc SA, a chemical company in Paris.
Currently, poultry is rinsed in chlorinated water.
The Agriculture Department approved irradiation of poultry in 1992, but so far no national brand processor has sold irradiated poultry because of fears of a consumer backlash.
Rhone-Poulenc's solution, called AvGard, contains the compound trisodium phosphate, which already is used as a processing aid in the production of certain cheeses, cereals and baked goods.
The Agriculture Department is conducting a rulemaking proceeding to make its administrative approval final, although Rhone can sell its new process immediately, the agency said.
Richard V. Kennedy, general manager of Rhone-Poulenc's food-ingredients division, said the USDA had given a previous approval for the use of the rinse in the "post-chill" phase of poultry processing in preparation for refrigeration.
However, he said, poultry companies balked at adopting the technology because it is difficult to retrofit that area of the processing plant with a rinsing tank.
On the other hand, plants have more flexibility to install a rinse tank before the birds get to the chilling process.
Caroline Smith DeWall of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer group, said the use of trisodium phosphate "may be a good quick fix" for poultry.
But she said it doesn't address many of the problems in the industry, such as overcrowding in coops, that "give rise to bacteria in chickens to begin with."
