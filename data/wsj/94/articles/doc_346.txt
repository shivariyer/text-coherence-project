The Securities and Exchange Commission said it filed and simultaneously settled a lawsuit, charging three former executives of Comptronix Corp. with overstating the company's earnings.
In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the SEC alleged that William J. Hebding, former chairman and chief executive officer, Allen L. Shifflet, former president and chief operating officer, and J. Paul Medlin, former controller, treasurer and assistant secretary, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to overstate earnings of the electronic parts manufacturer between 1989 and 1992.
It also charges that the three men camouflaged the scheme from the board and independent auditors by altering, falsifying and counterfeiting documents and manipulating accounting records.
Without admitting or denying guilt, the three men agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating antifraud reporting, recordkeeping and internal control provisions of federal securities laws.
In addition, the men agreed not to serve as officers or directors of any public company.
They also agreed to pay back bonuses and disgorge trading losses they avoided during the period.
Mr. Hebding declined to comment on the settlement.
Messrs. Shifflet and Medlin were unavailable for comment.
The Guntersville, Ala., company said it expects to receive repayment of bonuses totaling $390,000.
Mr. Hebding and Mr. Shifflett were ordered to pay $100,000 and $50,000 respectively.
The court did not impose a monetary penalty on Mr. Medlin, due to his inability to pay, according to the SEC.
In addition, Mr. Hebding agreed not to appear or practice before the SEC as an accountant.
Comptronix also entered into a settlement with the SEC that resolves the commission's investigation of the company.
