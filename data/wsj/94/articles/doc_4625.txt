Paxar Corp. reported a 23% drop in net income in the fourth quarter.
The label maker earned $1.87 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with $2.43 million, or 17 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1992.
The company blamed a "general softening" in apparel sales, which hurt the company's printed and woven label business.
