We were pleased to see Stanley Angrist's review of our book "Everything a Working Mother Needs to Know" in the Business Bookshelf (Leisure & Arts, Feb. 22).
The review, however, contained an error.
As we explain in the book, the Family and Medical Leave Act, passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton last year, guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for parents upon the birth or adoption of a child (as well as to care for a sick relative).
It applies to companies with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius, and provides significant protection to parents who work for such companies.
The Pregnancy Discrimination Act, in place since 1978, affects a far greater number of workers, because it applies to all private employers with 15 or more employees, but does not provide the same guarantees.
The Pregnancy Discrimination Act prohibits firing a woman simply because she is pregnant, and requires employers to treat pregnancy as they would a temporary physical disability.
The review confused the dates of passage of the two laws, leaving the erroneous impression that we have not made progress in the protection of working parents in recent years.
