Valley National Bancorp said it has acquired a 4.9% stake in Urban National Bank, Franklin Lakes, N.J., and has asked the Federal Reserve Board for clearance to buy up to 24.9%.
Valley, parent of Valley National Bank, said it bought 48,500 Urban shares from a family that owned 11.8% of Urban and, subject to Fed clearance, plans to purchase the rest of the family's shares.
Peter Southway, president of Valley, said the company values Urban at approximately $20 a share, about twice what the thinly traded stock had been quoted at recently.
Valley said it eventually might consider acquiring Urban, which has about $227 million in assets.
Valley National is a regional bank holding company whose principal unit has $3.4 billion in assets.
