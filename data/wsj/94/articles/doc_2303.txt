The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board ruled that five wells that Husky Oil Ltd. and Rigel Oil Ltd. want to drill to test a potentially large Alberta oil prospect are in the public interest.
The wells, which the two Calgary oil and gas producers plan to use to determine the size and productivity of their Moose Mountain oil discovery, about 25 miles west of Calgary, needed special regulatory approval because of the discovery's location in an environmentally sensitive area.
Closely held Husky holds a 66.7% interest in the 1992 discovery well and surrounding exploration properties.
Publicly traded Rigel holds the remaining 33.3% interest.
While the companies have declined to comment on the Moose Mountain reservoir's potential size, some analysts have estimated it may be as large as 100 million barrels.
