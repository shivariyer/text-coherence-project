Hollywood Casino Corp. said it formed a partnership with developer Christopher Hemmeter to compete for a riverboat gaming license in Michigan City, Indiana.
Mr. Hemmeter's Michigan City Casino & Lodge Inc. was the first to apply for the license last September, Hollywood Casino said.
The $161 million proposal includes a riverboat casino, restaurants, a hotel and convention facilities.
Hollywood, which owns and operates two riverboats in Aurora, Ill., and the Sands Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., will be an equal partner in the Indiana project with Mr. Hemmeter.
