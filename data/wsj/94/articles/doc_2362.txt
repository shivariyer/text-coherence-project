Burnup & Sims Inc. severed its ties with National Beverage Corp., changed its name, and tapped a new chief executive.
The telecommunications service company exchanged $18.1 million of debt in National Beverage for 3.1 million shares of Burnup common stock that had been held by National Beverage.
The swap ended the common ownership and management between the two companies, which was implemented in the late 1980s to thwart an attempted takeover of Burnup, which is based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
National Beverage, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is a holding company for various subsidiaries that produce soft drinks and bottled waters.
At a meeting Friday of Burnup shareholders, the company's name was changed to Mastec.
Additionally, shareholders approved Burnup's previously announced acquisition of closely held Church & Tower Inc., also a telecommunications service concern.
As previously reported, Burnup said it would issue 10,250,000 common shares, valued at about $58.8 million, to Church & Tower's stockholders.
Jorge Mas Jr., who heads Church & Tower, was named chief executive of Mastec.
He succeeds Nick A. Caporella, president and chief executive of National Beverage, who also had headed Burnup.
