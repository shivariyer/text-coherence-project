Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun cleared the way for CBS News to broadcast a report that includes hidden-camera videotape made in a South Dakota meatpacking plant.
The report, describing allegations of unsanitary conditions at the Federal Beef Processors Inc. plant in Rapid City, S.D., was scheduled to be shown last night on CBS-TV's "48 Hours."
Justice Blackmun, in response to an emergency filing by CBS, set aside a ruling by a South Dakota state judge who prohibited the network from using the hidden-camera material.
The state judge based his unusual order on Federal Beef's contention that the video would disclose company trade secrets, hurt its reputation and damage the local economy.
Stressing Federal Beef's determination to exclude outsiders from its facility, the judge said, "There is no First Amendment interest protecting the news media from calculated misdeeds."
The tape had been made by a Federal Beef employee who cooperated with CBS.
The South Dakota Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to set aside the judge's ruling, prompting CBS to appeal to the Justice Blackmun, who handles emergency matters arising in the federal jurisdiction that includes South Dakota.
Justice Blackmun's opinion reiterated that pre-emptive bans of broadcasts or publications are "particularly disfavored" under the Supreme Court's interpretation of the constitutional protection of the press and free speech.
