Marc Rich has succeeded in maintaining and building a successful international commodity and investment business despite being a fugitive from U.S. justice and facing continuing lawsuits from his former wife.
Mr. Rich fled the U.S. in 1983, with his partner Pincus Green, just before they were indicted on tax-evasion and racketeering charges relating to an alleged oil-trading scheme.
Now, Mr. Rich says, he wants to settle U.S. criminal charges outstanding against him.
He also seems resigned to having to face a long fight with his ex-wife, Denise, who has pursued him in the courts.
"It will probably take years to settle," the 59-year-old Mr. Rich says in an interview, referring to the legal dispute with his former spouse.
The former Mrs. Rich is seeking half of her husband's assets, which have been estimated to total as much as $1 billion.
Mr. Rich's ex-wife and her family provided some of the seed capital when, in 1974, Mr. Rich left Philipp Brothers and set up Marc Rich & Co.
She is no longer a stockholder, according to Mr. Rich.
"She redeemed her shares in December 1990," he says.
As chairman of Marc Rich & Co.
Holding AG, based in the nearby town of Zug, Switzerland, Mr. Rich oversees his 27.5% stake in the operating company, Marc Rich & Co.
It now has annual turnover of $30 billion from trading crude oil, petroleum products, metals, minerals and agricultural commodities.
Mr. Rich says that he hopes his decision to step down last year as chief executive officer of Marc Rich & Co. may make it easier to negotiate a settlement of the U.S. charges against him.
It has become Mr. Rich's custom to attend the annual World Economic Forum in this Alpine resort of Davos.
The gathering of world political and business leaders, which ends tonight, provides Mr. Rich an opportunity to meet with old friends and get an annual taste of the world of international financial circles that he hastily left more than a decade ago.
