Initial claims for state unemployment insurance dropped 47,000 in the week ended Feb. 5, to 366,000, the Labor Department said.
The big drop in claims follows a large rise the previous week, which many analysts say probably was due to earthquake-related layoffs in California and cold weather-induced construction cutbacks across much of the nation.
However, Marilyn Schaja, money market analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the recent trend in unemployment claims is still disturbing.
She noted that claims have been "stuck" above 350,000 since the beginning of the year, after ranging around 330,000 in late summer.
The four-week moving average of claims, which is considered a better marker of labor-market conditions, rose to 377,250 in the latest reporting week from 375,000 the week before.
The figures have been adjusted for seasonal variations.
