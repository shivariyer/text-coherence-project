Tumbling oil and technology issues depressed the stock market despite a rally in bonds.
The lack of an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement during the weekend to cut output sent oil-related stocks tumbling along with the price of crude.
Meanwhile, computer-related issues, especially those listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, were hit by profit-taking inspired by nervousness about the stock market's sharp losses last week.
Other recently strong stock groups were also depressed, including some economically sensitive stocks, such as basic materials and heavy-equipment producers.
Many of those stocks, though, finished above their lows.
