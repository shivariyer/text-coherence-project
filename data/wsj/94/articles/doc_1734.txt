Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, said it acquired DLP Inc., the world leader in development and manufacturing of cannula products used in heart surgery, for $128 million.
The maker of medical devices said it acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Grand Rapids, Mich.-based closely held concern and expects to realize future tax benefits of about $30 million associated with the acquisition.
DLP has annual sales of about $36 million, Medtronic said.
Cannula products are specialized tubes used in cardiac surgery to connnect the body's circulatory system to an external perfusion circuit, commonly known as the heart-lung machine.
Medtronic said the acquisition of DLP, in addition to the previously announced acquisition of Electromedics Inc., will further strengthen its cardiac surgery business and "significantly enhance its product line."
The company's Bio-Medicus already makes cannula products.
