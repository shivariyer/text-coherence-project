Metallgesellschaft AG, the troubled German metals and trading company, said it resumed bill payments interrupted by recent liquidity troubles.
"With the adoption of the restructuring plan by the creditor banks, the technical precautions for a resumption of payments were concluded," the company said.
"Therefore the temporary payment halt is lifted."
