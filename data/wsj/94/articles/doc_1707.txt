Dutch steel and aluminum maker Hoogovens NV said its net losses narrowed sharply to 234 million guilders ($123.4 million) in 1993 from 595.0 million guilders a year earlier and the company said it would swing to a profit in 1994, excluding extraordinary items.
Ijmuiden-based Hoogovens also announced that it plans to issue a seven-year convertible subordinated bond worth 275 million guilders.
The bonds will carry coupon interest rates to be set between 4.5% and 5.0% at a later date.
Meantime, the company said its sales last year were lower at 7.22 billion guilders ($3.81 billion) from 7.72 billion guilders in 1992.
Hoogovens said it was able to narrow its loss last year by reducing its extraordinary losses to 52 million guilders from 563 million guilders the previous year.
Moreover, steel sales outside of Europe rose, especially to the U.S. and China, Hoogovens said.
But selling prices remained weak all year at its aluminum division, where operating losses deepened significantly to 265 million guilders from 162 million guilders in 1992.
