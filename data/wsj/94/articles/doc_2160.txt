Stock prices managed to edge higher amid concern about a weak bond market and this week's expected inflation news.
Technology and banking issues provided much of the fuel for the advance, Thomas McManus, a market analyst at Morgan Stanley, said.
Elsewhere, share prices were mixed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added a scant 0.28, or 0.01%, to 3862.98.
Broad-based indexes that track mostly New York Stock Exchange issues posted somewhat larger gains, while the rally in computer-related issues made for an even bigger advance on the Nasdaq market.
Advancing issues led decliners, 1,159 to 949, on the Big Board.
Volume on the exchange eased to about 260,139,000 shares from 303,211,000 Friday.
It was the first tally under the busy 300 million level since Tuesday.
The jump in technology stocks was part of a continuing advance in the group, observers said.
"I think a lot of the new money coming in is going into technology.
It is the group with the upward momentum now," said Larry Kinney, head of over-the-counter trading at Soundview Financial.
Banks, meanwhile, were seen rebounding from recent weakness.
Banking stocks have been battered along with the bond market over the past month.
Morgan Stanley's Mr. McManus noted that the group has been weak since last fall.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index advanced 0.95, or 0.20%, to 467.39, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.48, or 0.19%, to 259.01, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index climbed 1.00, or 0.23%, to 442.82.
The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 3.60, or 0.46%, to 792.80.
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index advanced 2.08, or 0.45%, to 468.06.
The market's gains were kept in check by inflation worries.
A Labor Department reading on wholesale level prices is scheduled for release today, to be followed tomorrow by a report on consumer prices.

Walt Disney lost 1 1/8 to 45 7/8.

Kemper Corp. was unchanged at 40 7/8 on the Big Board but rocketed to 57 in composite trading after the exchange's close.

GE may increase its bid; it said the offer was rebuffed by the financial services concern.
GE was unchanged at 105 1/4.
It wasn't initially active after-hours.
Grumman added 5/8 to 65 3/8 as Northrop began its $60-a-share tender offer for the Bethpage, N.Y., aerospace concern.

William Dodge, market strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the stock market remains vulnerable to new selling if the bond market continues to slide.
"The equity market is still struggling with interest rates.
I still think there is some modest downside risk," he said.
The risk in bonds, though, has diminished, Mr. Dodge said.
Yesterday morning he recommended that clients increase their bond holdings to 35% of their portfolios, from a previously suggested 25%.
His recommended allocation to cash was trimmed to 5% from 15%.
The stock recommendation was left unchanged at 60%.
