If you call many federal agencies, you've probably noticed that a considerable number have changed their Washington phone numbers in the past couple of years.
(The recording you get doesn't tell you the new number, let alone connect you, which doesn't warm you to the bureaucracy.)
We're curious, however: Why does an organization that supposedly isn't growing need new phone exchanges so often?
