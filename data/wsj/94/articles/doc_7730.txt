The chief executive officer of Continental Can Co., Donald J. Bainton, was charged under insider-trading laws with allegedly giving nonpublic information on the company to a friend.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleged that Mr. Bainton in March 1992 tipped John R. Curtin, a friend and president of closely held WFF International Inc., that Continental Can, then known as Viatech Inc., was about to report poor year-end results.
Mr. Curtin sold all of his stock in the company, the SEC said, for $36.625 a share, or about $181,000.
Viatech's stock fell to a 52-week low after the announcement, and Mr. Curtin avoided $58,750 in losses, the SEC said.
Abdo Yazgi, executive vice president of Continental Can, said Mr. Bainton "categorically denies" that he disclosed insider information, or tipped Mr. Curtin off.
Mr. Bainton and his family own about 25% of the company's shares outstanding.
Mr. Bainton was previously president of Continental Can Group before it was acquired in 1984 by Peter Kiewit Sons Inc. of Omaha, Neb.
He led an effort to remake Viatech through several acquisitions and by adopting the old Continental Can name for the company.
The SEC is seeking injunctions against both Mr. Bainton and Mr. Curtin, and civil penalties from each.
The SEC said it also is seeking disgorgement of the $58,750 loss avoided by Mr. Curtin.
Mr. Yazgi of Continental Can said that Mr. Bainton "is confident he will be vindicated" in court.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Curtin denied the SEC's charges.
