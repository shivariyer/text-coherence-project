Cognex Corp., citing strong growth in Japan, said it is comfortable with analysts' expectations that it will post fourth-quarter net income of $3.3 million, or 18 cents to 19 cents a share.
In the 1992 fourth quarter, Cognex had net income of $821,000, or five cents a share, after $1 million in special charges, on revenue of $7.1 million.
The per-share figure was restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split in last September.
Robert J. Shillman, chairman and chief executive, said in an interview that revenue in the latest quarter was about $12.3 million to $12.4 million.
Cognex is a maker of machine "vision" systems, or computers that replace human vision in identifying and inspecting products as they are manufactured.
Mr. Shillman said revenue in Japan jumped 94% in 1993 as customers increased their orders.
In the fourth quarter, more than half of Cognex's total orders were booked in Japan.
For the year, 51% of its orders were booked there.
"Japanese manufacturing innovation seems to lead the rest of the world.
The Japanese are willing to invest and apply new technology more readily" than U.S. manufacturers, Mr. Shillman said.
While the Japanese economy is still uncertain, Cognex said most of its customers are original-equipment manufacturers of electronic, semiconductor and pharmaceutical products that are being exported to U.S., Hong Kong and European markets.
Cognex said it expects the Japanese market to continue to grow in 1994, since it signed 26 new Japanese customers last year.
New customers typically take about nine months to reach full production, the company said.
For all of 1993, Cognex said it is comfortable with analysts' expectations that it will post earnings of $11 million, or 61 cents to 63 cents a share, on revenue of $43.4 million to $43.5 million.
In 1992, the company had net of $6.1 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $28.6 million.
