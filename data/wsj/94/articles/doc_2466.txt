If tax cuts have lost their voter appeal, why are so few state legislators willing to oppose them?
This week, New Jersey Governor Christie Whitman signed into law the first stage of a 30% state income tax cut.
It passed both legislative houses with only four dissenting votes.
In Georgia this week, the state Senate unanimously approved Democratic Governor Zell Miller's $100 million income tax cut for seniors and families.
Mr. Miller is said to have been told by his longtime political guru James Carville that a tax cut would help him politically.
No word yet on this fiscal low-pressure system heading toward the Beltway.
