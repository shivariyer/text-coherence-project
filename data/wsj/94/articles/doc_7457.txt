Imo Industries Inc. said it had a fourth-quarter net loss after recording a $168 million anticipated loss on disposal of its Electro-Optical Systems Inc. business.
The disposal decision resulted in a quarterly loss of $245.6 million, or $14.52 a share, compared with net income of $333,000, or two cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales declined 24% to $153.1 million from $201.9 million.
Imo, which makes analytical and optical instruments, electronic and mechanical controls and engineered power products, said it will trim its work force by mid-1994.
The latest quarter included a charge of $23.7 million, or $1.40 a share, for restructuring and other unusual items.
The company recorded a $197 million loss in discontinued operations, including the anticipated item.
Imo took a $9 million charge to account for its cost-cutting plan, which will eliminate 700 jobs, or 11% of its work force, by mid-1994, leaving the company with about 5,800 employees.
The company added that it would seek a waiver from certain debtholders to borrow an additional $35 million for working capital and letters of credit.
Imo said the fourth-quarter charges violated certain lending covenants.
For the year, Imo reported a loss of $270.6 million, or $16.02 a share, compared with a loss of $82.6 million, or $4.90 a share, in 1992.
Sales declined 13% to $641.7 million from $733.6 million.
Standard & Poor's Corp., noting the large quarterly loss and violation of financial covenants, placed Imo's long-term debt under review with negative implications.
About $300 million of debt is affected.
S&P said Imo has an implied senior-debt rating of single-B-plus.
