Richard Rainwater, a well-known Texas investor, filed a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell 13,350,000 shares in a real estate investment trust at $25 a share.
The shares will represent 66.3% of the equity in the REIT.
The balance will be held by management and investors who contribute properties to the trust.
The trust, Crescent Real Estate Equities Inc., will own upscale retail centers, office buildings and single-family subdivisions in Denver and Texas.
The filing reported that the company will have substantially no debt following the $335 million offering and will have a $300 million line of credit.
The filing said $243.7 million of the proceeds will be used to repay debt secured by Mr. Rainwater and by properties that will be held by the REIT.
About $7.5 million raised by the formation of residential development corporations will be used to pay the taxes incurred as current investors of the properties transfer their holdings to the REITs.
The current investors include Mr. Rainwater, Rosewood Group and a long list of individuals.
Mr. Rainwater's formation of a REIT was expected and is part of a rush of REITs that have come on the market over the past year or so.
Low interest rates on money markets have sent investors scrambling for alternative investments with higher yields, and REITs have been offering dividend yields of 6.5% or more.
