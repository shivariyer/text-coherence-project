MCI Communications Corp. has asked state regulators in Virginia to allow new rivals to compete with Bell Atlantic Corp. in providing short-haul toll calls in the state.
Such a move would allow MCI, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and Sprint Corp. to provide toll service in competition with Bell Atlantic.
Currently, long-distance companies are prohibited by regulators from providing such services in competition with the Philadelphia-based regional Bell telephone company, which provides local phone service throughout the mid-Atlantic region.
In its filing with state regulators, MCI said that only five states, including Virginia, prohibit short-haul competition.
One of the other four states is New Jersey, also in Bell Atlantic's territory.
