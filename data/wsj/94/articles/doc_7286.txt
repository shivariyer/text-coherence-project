Avatar Holdings Inc. said it has removed its president and chief executive and named him a consultant to the company.
But the executive, Lawrence Wilkov, according to his attorney, has been "undermined" at Avatar and wants the company to honor the remainder of his employment contract.
Mr. Wilkov, 61 years old, has been president of the real-estate and utility holding company since 1984.
He was named chief executive in 1990.
Yesterday, Avatar said that, as a result of "certain differences," Mr. Wilkov's status would be changed to that of consultant.
It declined to elaborate.
The company said Edwin Jacobson, 63, chairman of Avatar's executive committee, has assumed the duties of chief executive.
Mr. Jacobson couldn't be reached for comment.
Mr. Wilkov's attorney, Hugo L. Black Jr., said his client had a contract to run the company until December 1997.
But in the past month, Mr. Black said, Mr. Wilkov has found some of his decisions and actions blocked by other executives at Avatar.
Mr. Black said Mr. Wilkov won't be a consultant to the company.
Rather, Mr. Wilkov wants Avatar to uphold the terms of the remainder of his employment contract.
That pact, according to Mr. Black, calls for an annual salary of $300,000 and for Mr. Wilkov to receive a total of 60,000 shares of Avatar stock.
Through the first nine months of 1993, Avatar reported earnings of $8.9 million, or 88 cents a share, on revenue of $101.6 million.
Net income included a gain of $11.7 million on the sale of the company's Midwest Water Utilities and a charge of $964,000 for an accounting change.
