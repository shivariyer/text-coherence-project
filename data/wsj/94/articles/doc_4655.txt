The association of credit-card issuers said its chief operating officer, William T. Sandalls Jr., 50 years old, is leaving Saturday.
The decision follows the announcement last month by Alex W. "Pete" Hart, 53, who is leaving his position as president and chief executive officer in March to become executive vice chairman of Advanta Corp., a financial-services company.
As previously reported, he will be succeeded by banking consultant H. Eugene Lockhart.
MasterCard said it hasn't named a replacement for Mr. Sandalls.
