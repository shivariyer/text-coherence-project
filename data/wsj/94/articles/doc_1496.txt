CCAir Inc., a commuter carrier that serves as USAir Express, said it rejected a Mesa Airlines acquisition offer valued at $32 million.
Instead, CCAir offered a counterproposal that Mesa buy the company in a stock deal valued at $37.4 million.
Mesa, a regional carrier based in Farmington, N.M., said it didn't have a comment on CCAir's counteroffer.
Under the counteroffer, CCAir, based in Charlotte, N.C., proposed that Mesa pay its shareholders 0.27 common share of Mesa for each share of CCAir.
Under the original offer, Mesa said it would exchange about 1.5 million Mesa shares for the roughly seven million CCAir shares outstanding, valuing them at $4.50 a share.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday, Mesa's shares closed at $22, down 25 cents, while CCAir shares rose 50 cents to $4.875.
