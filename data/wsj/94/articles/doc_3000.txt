OrNda Healthcorp said it adopted two accounting changes that caused a decrease in previously reported results and a net increase in assets and shareholders' equity.
The changes, which relate to the company's investment in Houston Northwest Medical Center, were prompted by discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission over OrNda's planned mergers with American Healthcare Management Inc. and Summit Health Ltd., the company said.
Those mergers won't be affected, the company added.
OrNda, a hospital chain in Nashville, Tenn., said it restated earnings for the four fiscal years ended Aug. 31, 1990, through 1993, as well as for its fiscal first quarter ended Nov. 30, 1993.
The company originally posted a net loss for those periods combined of $155.9 million; the restatements widen that loss by an additional $48.3 million.
Assets and shareholders' equity increased $35.6 million.
