Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s new chairman and chief executive officer, Michael Jordan, earned $904,000 for six months of work in 1993, and was granted options to buy one million shares.
The company's latest proxy statement also discloses that Robert A. Watson, hired to liquidate Westinghouse's loss-ridden financial-services arm, earned $14.5 million for his 18 months of service.
This newspaper previously reported that he had received at least $10 million.
He collected that amount in 1993, but he also took in $4.6 million the previous year.
Westinghouse is one of the few companies that can list three CEOs in its compensation table for the same year.
Paul E. Lego, who stepped down as chairman and CEO under pressure in January 1993, after three years in the posts, collected a total of about $1,870,000, including a "a special separation agreement" of $800,000, consulting fees of $600,000 and a performance incentive of $418,000, as well as a salary of $58,333 for one month on the job.
The previous year he earned $725,000.
Mr. Lego, 63 years old, also will receive $600,000 in 1994.
His annual pension benefit will be about $910,000 a year after he turns 65.
Meanwhile, Gary M. Clark, the company president who served as acting CEO for six months, collected $1.03 million in 1993.
Westinghouse said Mr. Jordan's compensation package was structured "to motivate him to take actions necessary and to reward him for increased value to shareholders."
Mr. Jordan, 57, is receiving a base salary of $1 million and a minimum 1994 annual incentive of $300,000.
In 1993, he collected salary of $503,799 and a signing bonus of $400,000, in lieu of any annual incentive for 1993.
His one million shares of long-term stock options -- 750,000 of which are exercisable at $15.44 a share, and 250,000 at $26 -- are subject to shareholder approval of the company's long-term incentive plan for management.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Westinghouse shares closed at $13.375, up 12.5 cents.
The high salaries stand in marked contrast to the thousands of layoffs throughout the company in the past few years.
In January, the company announced some 6,000 more job cuts for the next two years, about 11% of its work force, and took a fourth-quarter charge of $906 million.
The company already cut 20% to 25% of its work force from 1988 through 1993, and currently has 85,000 employees.
For 1993, Westinghouse reported a net loss of $326 million, or $1.07 a share, which followed on the heels of a loss of $1.39 billion, or $4.11 a share, the previous year.
The company's problems are rooted in its disastrous foray into financial services, as well as sluggish growth in its traditional power-generation and defense-electronics business.
