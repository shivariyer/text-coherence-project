The House Banking Committee said that the U.S. Central Credit Union had deposited $255 million in the failed Banco Espanol de Credito and asked the Federal Reserve Board whether other American financial institutions were hurt by the Spanish bank failure.
The deposits of U.S. Central, which handles investment and services for America's 13,000 credit unions, weren't insured.
However, the central bank of Spain said in December that it intends to guarantee all foreign and domestic deposits in Banco Espanol, known as Banesto.
The bank was seized by the Spanish government a month ago.
J.P. Morgan & Co., the New York banking company, had made a major investment in Banesto, which it stands to lose.
The banking panel's discovery that U.S. Central, which is based in Overland Park, Kan., also had been involved with Banesto has spurred the panel to find out if other banks had deposits there.
The House panel has asked the Fed to provide it with information on how it supervises the investments by Morgan, as well as reports on other banks that may have made investments or deposits in Banesto.
In December, Spain's central bank fired the chairman and the entire board of Banesto, Spain's fourth-largest commercial bank, in an attempt to stave off a threatened run on deposits.
The central bank said it was acting under provisions of Spanish banking law in light of jitters stemming from severe financial pressures on Banesto.
The central bank's move, though talked about for months as a possibility, was a bombshell in Madrid's financial markets.
