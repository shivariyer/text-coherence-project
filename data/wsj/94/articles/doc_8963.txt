U.K. industrial holding company BTR PLC said it will float its Graham Group, seeking a listing on the London Stock Exchange, through a public offer and placing.
The Graham Group encompasses two distribution businesses: Graham Builders Merchants and Goodman Croggon.
It has 2,900 employees and is the U.K.'s fourth-largest builders merchant by sales, accounting for around 5% of the market.
In 1992, Graham Group sales totaled around 350 million, BTR said.
A spokesman said it was too early to divulge what price it expects to receive in the flotation.
He said a prospectus will be released in February.
In London Stock Exchange trading yesterday, BTR gained 4.5 pence to 364.5 pence.
