Your Jan. 6 Politics & Policy article on Empower America doesn't stick to its subject.
You devote eight out of 18 paragraphs to Sen. Bob Dole -- who recently founded a competing organization -- to Sen. Dole's new ally Jude Wanniski, and to Response Dynamics Inc. (RDI), a direct-mail firm.
These characters are introduced only to impugn: Messrs. Dole and Wanniski naturally have little good to say about Empower America, and you all but call the group foolish for hiring RDI, on the dubious ground that the firm previously did work for the folks who made the Willie Horton ads.
In addition, you discuss the salary of Heritage Foundation president Dr. Edwin Feulner, who has no relation whatsoever to Empower America.
You want things both ways.
You try to portray the Empower America fellows as lackeys of Wall Street money and simultaneously as direct-mail hustlers who need to con thousands of citizens into "empowering" nonprofit fat cats.
Denied the free publicity the liberal media regularly bestow on their pet causes, the conservative think tanks have appealed to their constituencies with direct mail and grass-roots organizations, including (horrors) churches.
Finally, because most conservatives hold jobs with no built-in public forum, they have generously ensured that the men and women fighting the ideological battle have salaries comparable to their liberal counterparts in the news media.
There is nothing sinister in this -- except that liberals are offended by how well it works.
