Seeking to attract more investors to its mutual funds, Montgomery Asset Management said it cut its initial minimum-investment requirement to $500 from $2,000.
"Little acorns can grow into oak trees," says R. Stephen Doyle, chairman of Montgomery Asset Managment, the money management arm of San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities.
"We've been making so many exceptions anyway, especially with kids' accounts, that we decided to lower the minimum for everyone."
Montgomery Funds, Montgomery Asset Management's mutual fund branch, currently has nine funds and plans to offer three more in the next couple months.
Launched in June 1990, Montgomery Asset Management now manages close to $3 billion in total assets, with $1.5 billion in its mutual funds.
