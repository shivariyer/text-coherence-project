SFFed Corp. said it expects to post a net loss for the first quarter after real estate losses and loan-loss provisions of about $16 million.
In the year-earlier quarter, the San Francisco savings and loan earned $3.2 million, or 41 cents a share.
Of the $16 million, about half is related to three major nonresidential real estate loans and one foreclosed commercial real estate property.
Most of the balance reflects the company's decision to increase its reserves "in light of continued weak markets" for commercial and foreclosed real estate loans, SFFed said.
SFFed expects the loss provisions will increase its ratio of loss reserves to gross nonperforming assets to 50% as of March 31, up from 38% at year end.
