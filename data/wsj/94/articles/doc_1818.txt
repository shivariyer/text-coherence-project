U.S. agricultural exports should increase between $1.6 billion and $4.7 billion in the year 2000 as a result of the recently concluded world trade pact, the Agriculture Department estimated.
In a 48-page analysis of the pact, concluded under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the department estimated that grains and animal products would account for about three-fourths of the anticipated export increase.
The report didn't provide current figures for exports, but the changes would be a small part of total agricultural trade.
Agricultural export-related employment should increase between 41,000 and 112,000 jobs by 2000, the report estimated.
Increased exports should also raise farm prices, the report said.
That, in turn, would reduce farm program outlays by $695 million to $1.3 billion by 2000.
