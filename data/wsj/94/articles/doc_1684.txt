The California Public Employees' Retirement System said it is opposed to the centerpiece of President Clinton's health plan, the mandated regional alliances that would buy medical coverage for groups of employees.
The president has cited the huge pension fund, known as Calpers, as a model health-purchasing alliance.
But the Calpers program would be eliminated by his proposed reform, which requires all public employees and retirees to obtain health care through mandatory regional alliances.
Board President William D. Crist said that Calpers supported the goal of Mr. Clinton's proposal, but added in a statement: "We have concerns about the impact of his reform proposal on our successful, cost-effective health-programand the almost one million Californians it represents."
