National Convenience Stores Inc. agreed to swap 80 of its Stop N Go stores in California and Georgia for 88 convenience stores in Texas owned by Circle K Corp.
With the transaction, terms of which weren't disclosed, each company is concentrating further its geographical scope.
Both retail chains emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings last year and have been scaling back operations.
The transaction is expected to be completed in late March, giving Houston-based National Convenience a total of 723 stores, all in Texas, down from 1,100 stores in 21 markets in 1986.
Circle K, owned by Bahrain-based holding company Investcorp International Inc., has about 2,500 stores in 28 states, down from about 4,600 in 1990.
The sale to National Convenience will leave Circle K without any stores in the Houston or Dallas areas, but the company will still operate 272 outlets elsewhere in Texas.
