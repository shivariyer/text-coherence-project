General Motors Corp.'s Saturn unit will add $2,800 at end of this month to each worker's 1993 bonus, bringing the total bonus for last year to $5,100.
Saturn made a profit last year, before interest, taxes and health-care costs, for the first time since it began producing cars in 1990; that helped trigger the large bonuses.
The 8,500 Saturn workers were also rewarded because Saturn met quality and production goals, a Saturn spokesman said.
