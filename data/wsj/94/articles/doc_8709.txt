It seems logical enough: The area around the Galleria is the Galleria area.
So says the Galleria itself, the 300-store shopping center in Houston that has been taking out advertisements in local newspapers, exhorting the public and the media not to call the environs of the famed mall the "Galleria area," but "Uptown Houston" instead.
Why the objection?
"We're protecting the fact that it's our name," says Lois Williams, assistant marketing director for the Galleria, which is owned by Hines Interests Ltd., Houston.
"We're a special place."
The Galleria has long been aggressive about protecting its name, which is registered with the state as a service mark, and thus should only be used to denote the Houston shopping center and its sister development in Dallas, also owned by Hines Interests.
"A lot of people try to ride on our coattails," Ms. Williams complains.
In Dallas, Galleria's name hasn't crept beyond the mall, in part because the mall is only 11 years old, (Houston's is 25), and in part because its north Dallas location was well known before the shopping center was built.
"We haven't had instances of references from area businesses," says Jane Robertson, director of marketing.
But in Houston, the Galleria name pops up on car dealerships, electrolysis offices and gas stations in the mall's vicinity -- to cite just a few instances.
There's even a Galleria Area Chamber of Commerce, which, Ms. Williams notes, "we do not recognize."
But getting people to switch to "Uptown Houston" will be tough.
John Breeding, president of the Uptown Houston civic group (which the Galleria does recognize), says that "people are every bit as familiar with Uptown Houston as they were with the former name" for the area.
Perhaps, but for those who have somehow forgotten the old name, it was Magic Circle.
That moniker faded in the 1970s -- because so few people used it.
