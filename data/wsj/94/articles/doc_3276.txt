A state court jury awarded $15 million in punitive damages against Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. and two other companies for three women's illnesses allegedly related to silicone breast implants.
The jury's award is in addition to $18.5 million in actual damages already assessed in the same case against the same three companies.
The verdicts were against St. Paul, Minn.-based 3M, McGhan Medical Corp. and McGhan's parent company, Inamed Corp. of Las Vegas.
3M owned McGhan from 1977 until 1984.
The case has been watched closely because of its possible impact on 3M's strategy in future breast-implant litigation.
The company so far is staying out of a $4 billion tentative global settlement of implant liability that is being negotiated by plaintiff's attorneys and representatives of major implant manufacturers.
But negotiators of that deal, which still isn't final, have speculated a big verdict against 3M could push it toward participating in the overall settlement.
A 3M spokeswoman said the company's decision wouldn't be based on one case and that insurance will cover any payments.
She also said the lupus and neuropathy, which the three Houston plaintiffs suffered, weren't caused by implants.
Inamed declined to comment.
