Sandoz AG said it expects to report 1993 group net income increased "more than 10%" from 1992 because of higher operating profit and tight cost controls.
The Swiss chemical and pharmaceuticals company with large U.S. operations, also said group sales climbed 5% to 15.1 billion Swiss francs ($10.34 billion) from 14.42 billion francs.
It attributed the sales growth to the "increasing dynamism of pharma sales and the above-average performance of the core sector, chemicals and environment."
Sandoz said its Life Sciences divisionwhich includes pharmaceuticals, nutrition products, and seeds-posted sales growth of 4% to 10.051 billion francs from 9.637 billion francs.
The Chemicals and Environment division, meanwhile, which includes industrial chemicals, agrochemicals, and construction and environmental chemicals, had sales growth of 6% to 5.049 billion francs from 4.779 billion francs.
Pharmaceuticals sales climbed 7% to 7.348 billion francs from 6.87 billion francs, with the pace of sales growth rising to 10% in the fourth quarter.
Among 1993's best-selling pharmaceuticals products, Sandimmun sales were up 15%, Clozaril/Leponex up 60%, Sandostatin up 15%, and DynaCirc/Lomir up 43%, Sandoz said.
Sales growth in these products "are a clear demonstration that the research efforts of yesterday are the basis for today's success," the company said.
Elsewhere in the Life Sciences division, sales in the nutrition sector were down 1% to 1.722 billion francs from 1.746 billion francs.
The company attributed much of the decline to the weakness of the Swedish krona against the Swiss franc.
Excluding currency factors, nutrition sales were up 4%.
Sales in the seeds sector, meanwhile fell 4% to 981 million francs from 1.021 billion francs, largely reflecting the divestiture of "activities with little added value," Sandoz said.
