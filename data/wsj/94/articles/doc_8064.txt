Citing apparent price-gouging in the wake of last week's earthquake, the Southland Corp. said it notified eight 7-Eleven convenience store franchisees in the Los Angeles area that it will terminate their contracts.
Dallas-based Southland said calls from customers complaining about profiteering led the company to send its own employees out to shop at about 100 of its franchise convenience stores.
The company discovered eight stores, most of them in the San Fernando Valley, that had substantially raised prices, in some cases doubling them, on basic items such as food and water.
A Southland spokeswoman said the company is turning over the results of its investigation to the Los Angeles city attorney's office.
A city ordinance makes it a misdemeanor to raise prices more than 10% after an emergency is declared, said Greg Parham, deputy city attorney.
Mr. Parham said the city hasn't charged anyone with profiteering, but he added that there is evidence of widespread price-gouging by merchants in the hardest hit parts of the city, and that an investigation continues.
Southland declined to release the names or locations of the eight franchises.
A spokeswoman said the company hasn't previously terminated any franchisees for price-gouging.
