A group of environmental organizations has formed -- of all things -- a long-distance telephone company.
The Boston company, Earth Tones, promises prices 5% to 10% lower than the base rates of leading carriers, such as American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
Profits from customer calls will be used for green causes, such as saving spotted owls, rescuing the rain forests and spreading the environmental gospel.
For now Earth Tones is a mere snail darter of a business, with 600 customers nationwide, signed up during a six-month trial period.
But recently, it mailed 100,000 brochures seeking new customers from the membership lists of environmentally friendly groups.
Other promotions are also planned.
One slogan on the company's promotional literature is "Dialing for Dolphins."
"We have no deep-pocketed investors or high-paid executives to worry about, so people can feel better about paying a phone bill," said Earth Tones director, Derek Cressman.
"All of our profits go to something they believe in."
Benson Chiles, a Wisconsin environmental activist, said "a lot of people want to help the environment but don't feel like they have the time.
Earth Tones gives you a way to help just by calling your friends."
Earth Tones' founders include 12 Public Interest Research Groups, the consumer watchdogs spawned by Ralph Nader years ago.
It is aiming for as many as 10,000 customers in a couple years, Mr. Cressman said.
Profits will be spread among a variety of causes and groups, including the research groups themselves and other groups involved in forming the company, such as the National Environmental Law Center, Earth Day 2000 and Pesticide Watch.
Earth Tones, which buys long-distance capacity from Allnet Communications Services Inc., will mail bills directly to its customers -- on recycled paper, of course.
