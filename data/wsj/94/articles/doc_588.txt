Laura Tyson, chief White House economist, said the Federal Reserve may increase short-term interest rates more than the administration predicted this year.
The White House predicted in February that the Fed would raise short-term interest rates by about half a percentage point in 1994.
The year isn't yet three months old, and the Fed has done that.
In a speech here, Ms. Tyson said economic growth this year is more likely to exceed the White House forecast than fall short of it.
"Signs of consumer spending should remain healthy because incomes are growing," she said.
"Investment spending should remain healthy because demand is growing.
Inventories are extremely lean right now . . . which will be another reason for additional production."
The White House has projected that the economy would grow 3% between the fourth quarters of 1993 and 1994.
Ms. Tyson said a greater-than-predicted increase in short-term rates isn't a threat to economic growth.
"In fact, it's a reflection of the stronger growth in the economy," she said.
