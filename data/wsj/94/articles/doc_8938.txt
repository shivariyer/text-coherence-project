Hewlett-Packard Co., as part of its strategy to push into low-end computer markets, plans to unveil today a lower cost workstation.
The computer, called the HP 9000 Model 712, is the first of a new workstation line code-named Gecko that is based on a new H-P multimedia chip and the H-P version of the Unix operating system.
It can display full-motion video, which could allow business customers to do video conferencing at their desks.
List prices on the machine start at $3,995, only slightly more than less powerful personal computers based on Intel Corp.'s new Pentium chip.
H-P, based in Palo Alto, Calif., and other makers of workstations -- powerful computers with fancy graphics favored by engineers -- have been battling one another to woo customers in the low end of the market, usually the turf of No. 1 workstation maker Sun Microsystems Inc.
They have also been lowering prices to be able to compete better with the most powerful PCs.
