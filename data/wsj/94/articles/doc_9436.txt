Triarc Cos. said a federal court approved a proposed settlement which calls for Triarc to acquire the 29% stake of Southeastern Public Service Co. that it doesn't already own in a stock transaction valued at about $68 million.
Triarc, based in New York, said the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida approved a proposed settlement between Southeastern shareholders and Triarc, formerly DWG Corp., which implements the acquisition.
Southeastern shareholders will receive 0.8 Triarc shares for each share of the utility they own, or a total of 2.7 million shares.
The settlement still requires approval by holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Southeastern shares not owned by Triarc.
Triarc is a holding company that owns Arby's Inc., Royal Crown Cola Co., Graniteville Co. and National Propane Corp.
Southeastern is a Miami-based utilities services company.
