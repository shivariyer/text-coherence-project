C.R. BARD Inc. (Murray Hill, N.J.) -- Gerald L. Messerschmidt was elected to the newly created post of vice president of scientific affairs.
Dr. Messerschmidt, 43, will be in charge of the medical-device maker's regulatory affairs under a settlement reached in October with the Justice Department.
The company agreed to pay $61 million in fines related to its sale of defective catheters used in heart surgery.
The company, which is under extensive government scrutiny for four years, also agreed to consolidate its regulatory affairs under one executive.
