Memorex Telex NV said that its prepackaged bankruptcy plan became effective as scheduled on March 24.
Under the plan, holders of about $850 million of senior bank and public debt will receive 100% of the data storage company's stock.
Shareholders will receive warrants that eventually would allow them to buy up to 4% of the company's equity.
Memorex Telex is a Dutch company with its executive offices in Irving, Texas.
The new stock began trading yesterday on a when-issued basis as an American depositary receipt on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol MEMYV and closed at $8.25.
