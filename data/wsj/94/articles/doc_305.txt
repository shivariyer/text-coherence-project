Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. said it would offer voluntary early retirement to workers older than 55 as part of a cost-cutting effort begun in February.
Up to 15% of the company's work force could be eligible, the company said.
At the end of 1993, it had 3,769 employees.
Details of the plan, which is expected to be implemented by the fall, are not final.
Oklahoma Gas & Electric said it is reviewing its operations to better compete in the electric utility industry, and could institute other cost-cutting measures.
