First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc. filed a reorganization plan with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, offering to pay bondholders in full.
The plan hinges on a tentative settlement of a lawsuit First City filed in the bankruptcy court against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., alleging that the agency unjustly seized the bank holding company's 20 banks in 1992 while it was trying to recapitalize itself with private funds.
First City has estimated that the settlement will give it $275 million to $375 million from the sale of the seized assets.
Under the Chapter 11 reorganization plan, bondholders would get back their principal and interest -- 85% in cash and the rest in new 6.15% five-year bonds.
Preferred-share holders would get new preferred stock, while common shareholders would get new common stock.
The plan is subject to approval of the bankruptcy court, creditors and shareholders.
