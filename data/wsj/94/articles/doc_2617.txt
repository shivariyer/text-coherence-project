As part of a realignment of senior management, Tommy Hilfiger Corp. named a former executive of Liz Claiborne Inc. as vice chairman and president.
Jay Margolis, 45 years old, resigned as chairman of Liz Claiborne last year to join Hilfiger as a director and to join the London jeanswear maker, Pepe Group PLC, as chairman and chief executive officer of its U.S. unit.
Both were founded by investors Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll.
Mr. Chou is the chairman of both Hilfiger and Pepe.
In his new job at Hilfiger, Mr. Margolis will be "an integral part of planning the company's growth in licensing retailing and, in particular, the development of the company's women's line," according to a statement from Mr. Chou.
Mr. Margolis resigned his positions at Pepe Jeans USA to focus on Tommy Hilfiger.
He will be succeeded at Pepe by Edwin Lewis, 43, who resigned as chief executive officer of Hilfiger.
Mr. Lewis, who has become an investor in Pepe, was also named a vice chairman at Hilfiger.
Joel Horowitz, 43, was promoted to chief executive officer of Hilfiger, succeeding Mr. Lewis.
Mr. Horowitz was formerly Hilfiger's president and chief operating officer.
No one will be named to the position of chief operating officer, the company said.
And Tommy Hilfiger, 42, was promoted to honorary chairman from the position of vice chairman.
Mr. Hilfiger continues to be the company's principal designer, and he'll continue to direct all aspects of the company's design and marketing.
