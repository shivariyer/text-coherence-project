Mary Lisanti, vice president and portfolio manager of small-cap and mid-cap funds at Bankers Trust Co., is betting small-cap stocks will continue to have a banner year and that rate concerns will be nearly irrelevant over the longer term.
"The focus will be more on earnings power and the rate of earnings growth," Ms. Lisanti said.
She pointed to the fact that since March 1 the Russell 2000 has gained 2.21% and hit three consecutive records.
By contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 1.58% for the month to date, and the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index is up 0.88%.
Neither has set closing highs this month.
Since the year began, the Russell index has climbed 4.49%, the Dow industrials have improved 3.07% and the S&P 500 has increased just 0.45%.
"Small-cap stocks had three corrections last year -- in February, April and October -- so they were set up to outperform this year," Ms. Lisanti said.
Smaller issues also enjoyed bigger gains last year than those posted by large-cap stocks.
Ms. Lisanti said she is focusing on small regional banks that could be good takeover plays, technology stocks, automotive services companies, semiconductor equipment firms and smaller industrial companies with good export capabilities.
