In your Nov. 26 page-one article "Currency Waves -- Global Money Trends Rattle Shop Windows in Heartland America," you discuss how the yen has affected Hobart Brothers Co.
Unfortunately, you use Hobart and Motoman Inc. interchangeably.
Motoman is a joint-venture robot company whose market is the Americas, North and South.
We have had a record 1993, with more than $38 million in bookings and $33 million in revenue, reflecting a 45% compounded growth since our formation four and a half years ago.
Our profits are also strong.
Your article claims that due to the impact of the yen and the fluctuations of the Swedish krona, that Motoman shed our Swedish robotics business.
Actually, Motoman has nothing to do with Europe, and it was Hobart who sold its interest in the Swedish robotics company to our other parent, Yaskawa Electric Corp., the world's leading manufacturer of industrial robots.
The bottom line in your article appears to be that the impact of the yen is negatively changing the landscape of "Heartland America" that deals with the Japanese.
Though this would be the logical conclusion to draw, in reality the companies that deal with the Japanese are focusing on customer satisfaction, aggressive cost-reduction programs, and dynamic product and currency strategies -- resulting in increased success in spite of the dollar's weakness.
