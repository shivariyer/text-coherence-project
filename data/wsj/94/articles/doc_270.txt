Chrysler Corp. nudged into the top 10 companies in terms of sales in Fortune magazine's latest Fortune 500 list of industrial companies.
The auto maker was ranked eighth, with sales of $43.6 billion, changing places with Chevron Corp., which dropped to 11th.
Chrysler was last ranked in the top 10 in 1989.
General Motors Corp. led the list for the eighth consecutive year, with sales of $133.62 billion, while Ford Motor Co. rose one notch to second from third, with $108.52 billion in sales, swapping places with Exxon Corp.
The others in the top ten are International Business Machines Corp., fourth; General Electric Co., fifth; Mobil Corp., sixth; Philip Morris Cos., seventh; Texaco Inc., ninth, after switching places with DuPont Co., tenth this year.
Fortune said profits for the 500 companies totaled $62.6 billion last year, after losses of $196.2 million in 1992, the first time the list ever showed a loss, in large part as a result of accounting changes.
