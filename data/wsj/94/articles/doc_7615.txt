Smith International Inc. said it agreed in principle to buy Dresser Industries Inc.'s interest in a drilling fluids company for $160 million.
Smith said in Houston that the agreement calls for it to acquire Dresser's 64% interest in M-I Drilling Fluids Co.
The remaining 36% of M-I is owned by Halliburton Co.
Smith said that for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, the drilling fluids company generated revenue of $398.4 million.
The acquisition will be financed from cash and borrowings.
The transaction is expected to close on Feb. 28.
Its completion is subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement, to approval of Smith's and Dresser's boards and to certain federal regulatory approvals.
