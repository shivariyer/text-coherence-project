Cenvill Development Corp. said the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Miami confirmed a liquidation plan for the real-estate developer.
In 1992, Cenvill filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
That same year, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of several of Cenvill's assets to Hilcoast Development Corp.
