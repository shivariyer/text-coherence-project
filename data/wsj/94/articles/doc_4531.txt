Honda Motor Co., the Japanese automobile and motorcycle maker, reported that its consolidated pretax profit for the October-December quarter slumped 31%.
Pretax profit was 12.54 billion yen ($119.9 million) compared with 18.23 billion yen a year earlier.
A Honda spokesman said its group earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, which it announced in November, remains valid.
"We see that we have made steady progress toward the forecasted amounts so far in the first nine months," he said.
In November, Honda said its consolidated net profit for the current fiscal year will total 17.3 billion yen, down 55% from the fiscal 1992 level, while sales will decline 8.6% to 3.775 trillion yen.
The company hasn't released its outlook for fiscal-year pretax profit and earnings per share.
