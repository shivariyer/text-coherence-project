The semiconductor industry continued to show improvement, driven by demand in the personal-computer sector, as the industry's leading indicator rose in January.
The book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.07 in January, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group.
That means that for every $100 of chips shipped, the industry received $107 of new orders, indicating a growth market.
In December, the ratio was 1.04.
New orders for the North American market in January, based on a three-month moving average, were $2.46 billion, a 6% increase from $2.32 billion recorded the previous month.
