Accelerating a move into the Northeast, Starbucks Corp. said it will buy Coffee Connection Inc. for an undisclosed amount of newly issued stock.
Coffee Connection, a privately held company based in Boston, operates 22 stores in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey.
Starbucks, based in Seattle, said it will continue to operate the chain under its current name.
Starbucks had already announced plans next month to open its first stores in Boston, followed by New York and Minneapolis.
The company, which now has 300 stores, expects to open at least 78 new ones in 1994.
Analysts said the deal would increase Starbuck's sales, and possibly earnings, this year.
The company's shares jumped $2.25 to $24.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday.
