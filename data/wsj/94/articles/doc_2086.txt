Adm. Jeremy "Mike" Boorda, who has been the top U.S. military officer directly involved in NATO operations in Bosnia, will be nominated to succeed Frank Kelso as the Navy's top officer, the White House said.
The move has been expected since last month, when Adm. Kelso said that because of the Tailhook scandal, he would retire two months early.
Adm. Boorda has been the commander of the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
But with a peace agreement looking more likely in Bosnia, the main NATO mission in that region soon could become peacekeeping, which means that the most prominent military job would become the Army's.
If confirmed by the Senate, Adm. Boorda, who enlisted in the Navy in 1956 at age 17, would become the first person ever to rise through every rank in the service to become the chief of naval operations.
He is 55 years old.
The affable native of South Bend, Ind., is considered especially good at handling people.
His major task is likely to be maintaining the morale and readiness of the service, which has been shaken by the post-Cold War downsizing, the Tailhook scandal and the Navy's minor role in the Persian Gulf War, compared with the Army and Air Force.
