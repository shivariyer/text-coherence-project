Federated Department Stores Inc. named Terry J. Lundgren chairman and chief executive officer of its merchandising division, the department-store chain's No. 2 merchandising position.
Mr. Lundgren, 41 years old, has been president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus Stores in Dallas, a unit of Neiman Marcus Group Inc., Chestnut Hill, Mass.
He will take over Federated's New York-based merchandising operation in early April after his contract with Neiman Marcus expires.
He'll report to Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive and its top merchant.
For Federated, Federated Merchandising is a crucial unit that coordinates the buying from designers and manufacturers, and develops its own private-label merchandise.
Overseeing 240 merchandising staffers, Mr. Lundgren will direct Federated's "centralized team buying" in picking merchandise for Federated's 218 department stores that operate under the names Abraham & Straus, Bloomingdale's and Burdines, among others, in 26 states.
He fills a post left open since last year when Roger N. Farah left to become head merchant at R.H. Macy & Co., Federated's rival and the company with which Federated has said it wants to merge.
Mr. Lundgren joined Neiman Marcus in 1988, was named president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus Stores in 1990, and last year added the title of chairman and retained the title of chief executive.
The move leaves Neiman Marcus searching for someone to sustain the improving image of the 27-store upscale specialty retailing chain.
Robert J. Tarr Jr., president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus Group, said a search has begun for a successor.
