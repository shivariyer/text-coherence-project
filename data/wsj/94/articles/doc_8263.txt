Regulators' ability to keep track of the government-securities market would be improved by a proposal to give them greater access to clearing information.
Under the proposal, published by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Government Securities Clearing Corp. would be authorized to release trading data to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other agencies that help to oversee trading of government securities.
The regulators could use the data for market surveillance but would have to keep information about specific firms confidential.
The initiative embodies an agreement entered into by the GSCC and the New York Fed.
The GSCC, a clearing agency registered with the SEC, offers a centralized, automated system for the clearance and settlement of trades in Treasury securities.
A report issued by regulators after the Salomon Brothers Inc.
Treasury bond scandal said the SEC believes that a partial audit trail could be constructed by combining transaction information from GSCC with available price and volume information.
The proposal must be approved by the SEC before it can take effect.
The agency asked interested parties to comment by Feb. 10.
