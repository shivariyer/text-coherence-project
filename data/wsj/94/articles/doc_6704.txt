Colgate-Palmolive Co. said fourth-quarter net income rose 11%, led by strong gains overseas and in its Hills pet-food business.
The New York-based consumer-products giant posted net of $122.1 million, or 78 cents a share, up from $110 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue for the quarter climbed 3.9% to $1.84 billion from $1.77 billion.
Colgate said it enters 1994 with "increasing momentum," citing a shift to higher-margin products.
It said its gross profit margin reached 47.6%, up from 46.9% in the fourth quarter of 1992.
For the full year, net dropped 60% to $189.9 million, or $1.08 a share, from $477 million, or $2.92 a share, in 1992.
The 1992 results were depressed by a charge of $358.2 million, or $2.30 a share, for accounting changes.
Revenue for the year grew 1.9% to $7.14 billion from $7.01 billion.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Colgate closed at $61.25, up 50 cents.
