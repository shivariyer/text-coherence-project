In a sign of continued weakness in the Mexican economy, Telefonos de Mexico SA, the giant telephone concern, reported a meager 4.5% gain in net income for 1993.
Telmex's earnings are perhaps the most widely watched among Mexican companies.
Telmex, whose American depositary shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, is a bellwether for Mexico's economy and stock market.
Telmex reported earnings of nine billion new pesos ($2.90 billion), or $5.47 per American depositary share, after a 15-cent-a-share charge for obsolete equipment.
The earnings were slightly below market expectations of about $5.50 a share.
Revenue climbed 10% to 24.6 billion new pesos, and operating profit rose 5.9%.
Traders bid up the stock and the Mexican market as a whole before the earnings report, as rumors of a $6-a-share earnings figure circulated.
The Mexican market closed at a record high Thursday, while in New York, Telmex ADSs rose $1.25 to $75.25 apiece.
But after the earnings announcement, analysts expected selling in Telmex ADSs this morning in New York.
"A lot of people over the past couple of days thought the earnings were going to be a lot higher," said Eric Anderson, analyst with Afin Securities International, New York.
He said the earnings reflect a weak Mexican economy.
Telmex posted 12.8% growth for the year in the number of telephone lines, in line with expectations.
