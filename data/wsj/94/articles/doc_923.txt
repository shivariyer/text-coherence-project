Taiwan's unemployment rate stood at 1.7% in February, rising 0.34 percentage point from the year-earlier month, and up 0.46 percentage point from January, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said Wednesday.
This compares with January's jobless rate of 1.2%, a 12-year low, December's 1.3%, and November's 1.4%.
The number of unemployed workers in February stood at 147,000, up 31,000, or 27%, from a year earlier, and up 39,000, or 37%, from the previous month.
Officials attributed the higher unemployment rate in February to many employees who quit after receiving bonuses before Chinese New Year.
