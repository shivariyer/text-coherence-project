Scott Latham's March 3 editorial-page article "Poor, Poor Motorola" is remarkable for its doctrinaire misinterpretation of the situation faced by our company in the cellular phone market in Japan.
Unfortunately, Mr. Latham is wrong on almost every count.
On Feb. 22 The Journal's correspondent in Tokyo correctly summarized our situation.
He wrote: "Motorola has long tussled with the Japanese government over the densely populated Tokyo-Nagoya cellular corridor.
Although the company gained a nearly 50% market share in other areas of Japan, it wasn't given the opportunity to sell its TACS cellular equipment in the Tokyo-Nagoya area until 1989, when under U.S. trade pressure Japan paired Motorola with cellular operator IDO Corp.
Since then, however, Motorola has charged that IDO has put most of its effort into a rival system designed by Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp."
The U.S.-type system in Tokyo-Nagoya has captured only about 1% of the cellular phone market, or a mere 12,900 phones, in an area where 60 million people live and work.
Our experience throughout the rest of the world shows that IDO should have been able to build a profitable business with as many as 450,000 cellular customers if it had fulfilled the promise to fully use the 5 MHz of spectrum allocated for this purpose, as promised in the 1989 U.S.-Japan cellular accord.
Put as plainly as possible, the issue is market access.
The problem is a series of actions, followed by inaction, by the government of Japan.
The result is systematic denial of access to Japan's most heavily populated market for foreign companies.
Clearly, we would prefer to gain market access through purely commercial means.
That has proven impossible.
Motorola has neither sought, nor obtained, a special position through U.S. government intervention.
We have simply asked for an equal opportunity at the starting gate.
