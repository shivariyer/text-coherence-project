Michael Jay Solomon, 56 years old, said he will leave as president of Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros.
International Television Distribution on April 1 to form his own company in Los Angeles to seek international joint ventures in all areas of new communications technology.
A successor hasn't been named, but company executives said a leading contender is Jeffrey Schlesinger, who had been Mr. Solomon's second in command at the unit, which distributes all Warner TV programs overseas.
Mr. Solomon was a co-founder of Telepictures Corp. in 1978, which later merged with Lorimar Corp.
Lorimar Telepictures Corp. was in turn acquired by Warner Bros. in 1989.
Mr. Solomon, whose contract at Warner Bros. was to expire, said he always intended to go out on his own again.
"It's just my personality.
I'm an entrepreneur," he said.
"I found nothing to keep me here at Warner Bros."
Warner said it wished Mr. Solomon well in his venture.
