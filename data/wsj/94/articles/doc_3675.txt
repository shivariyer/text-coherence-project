Snapple Beverage Corp. reported sharp increases in fourth-quarter net income, revenue and case sales.
But its stock still slid, apparently in reaction to Coca-Cola Co.'s new line of competing fruit drinks.
In Nasdaq trading yesterday, Snapple shares fell $1.75 to $27.125 a share.
Snapple, which went public in December 1992, posted a profit of $20 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a pro forma $4.3 million, or four cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
The pro forma numbers reflect the effects of several transactions, including the December 1992 equity offering, and the June 1993 acquisition of Mr. Natural Inc., as if they had occurred on Jan. 1, 1992, and July 1, 1992, respectively.
The latest quarterly figures include a one-time tax benefit of $8.1 million, or seven cents a share, because of the company's adoption of certain provisions of the 1993 tax legislation.
Revenue doubled to $117.7 million from a pro forma $58.2 million.
Sales volume totaled 12.5 million cases from six million cases the year before.
Snapple, which has dominated the market niche for bottled ice tea, fruitflavored drinks and other specialty beverages, has watched competitors enter the fast-growing market.
