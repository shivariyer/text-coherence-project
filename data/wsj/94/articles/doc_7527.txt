News Corp. said its TV Guide plans to enter the market for monthly cable-television guides prepared in partnership with cable-TV systems around the country.
News Corp.'s brief statement didn't provide details.
A spokeswoman for TV Guide said the company doesn't have a specific launch date yet and hasn't completed an agreement with any cable system operators.
The business TV Guide proposes to enter involves partnership arrangements with cable systems to prepare guides that are automatically sent to local subscribers.
That business is currently dominated by TVSM Inc. of Horsham, Pa., in which many major cable operators have bought stakes in recent years.
Last fall, there were reports that News Corp. and closely held TVSM were in merger talks, but both companies denied those reports.
TV Guide's subscriber base has dwindled in recent years to about 15 million, and the magazine has begun a number of strategies to remain a leader in providing television schedule information.
Among other things, the company is working on an electronic version of its schedules.
Currently TV Guide provides special "cable-specific" editions of its magazine in 10 cities, including New York.
These editions indicate not only that a program will appear on, say, HBO, but also give the local channel on which HBO airs in that market.
