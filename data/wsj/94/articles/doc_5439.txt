The European Union Commission said yesterday that it will study a plan by Ford Motor Co. to acquire control of Hertz Corp. by increasing its shareholding.
Ford already owns 49% of the world-wide car-rental company.
A Ford spokesman in the U.S. said Commerzbank of Germany wants to sell its 5% stake in Hertz to Ford.
Clearance by the EU agency is required.
Ford said the Federal Trade Commission cleared the proposal last year.
In a notice in the EU's Official Journal, dated Feb. 12, the commission said Ford's plan may fall under the jurisdiction of the EU's merger rules.
Under those rules, the agency has four weeks to decide whether the plan could harm competition in EU markets.
If it finds "serious doubts" about the transaction, it must open a deeper, four-month investigation.
The commission can alter or block such transactions if they would weaken competition.
The commission gave competitors until Feb. 22 to comment.
