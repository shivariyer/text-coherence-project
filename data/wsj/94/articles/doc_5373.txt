Aetna Life & Casualty Co. expects to report operating profit of more than $6.50 a share this year, company Chairman Ronald Compton told analysts.
The figure is better than expected by stock analysts.
Following Mr. Compton's remarks, Aetna stock rose to $64.375, up $1.625, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The insurer in Hartford, Conn., recently announced a restructuring that includes reducing its work force by 4,000, or 10%, and getting out of two pension businesses-single-premium annuities and guarantee-investment contracts.
The benefits of those actions will translate into higher operating profit.
Operating profit excludes capital gains on investments, and is viewed by insurance analysts as a better measure of earnings power than net income.
Last year, Aetna earned $5.49 a share, or $610 million, from operations.
"Barring abnormally high catastrophe losses and other unusual charges, we expect 1994 operating earnings to be somewhat north of $6.50 per share," Mr. Compton told analysts at a meeting in New York.
The per-share figure indicates $725 million in operating profit for 1994.
Mr. Compton emphasised that the company's individual business segments will post better results "especially in commercial property and casualty."
Aetna is in the midst of a restructuring designed to make it more profitable.
For years, its earnings have suffered from soured real estate investments, costly claims on pollution and asbestos as well as high expenses.
On a net basis, the company had a loss of $366 million, or $3.29 a share, against profit of $56 million, or 51 cents a share, in 1992.
In the fourth quarter, Aetna took a $1.28 billion charge to pay for the layoffs and the costs of getting out of the pension businesses.
