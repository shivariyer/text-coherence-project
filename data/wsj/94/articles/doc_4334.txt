Warnaco Group Inc. reported an 84% decline in fiscal fourth-quarter net income, due in part to a one-time charge.
The New York-based maker of underwear and menswear said net totaled $1.1 million, or six cents a share, down from $7.3 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.
The quarter ended Jan. 8 included a $18.6 million previously announced charge related to a loan refinancing.
The year-ago quarter included a charge of $7.4 million.
Revenue in the period rose 10% to $204.7 million from $185.1 million.
For all of fiscal 1994, net was $24.1 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with a loss of $20.2 million, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier.
The figure in both years was affected by one-time charges.
Fiscal 1994 revenue totaled $703.8 million, up 13% from $625.1 million a year before.
