Poland turned away some global media giants and awarded its first private-sector national TV network license to a Polish venture.
The National Radio and Television Council gave the nod to Polsat, a small Polish satellite TV operator, over nine competing bids from groups backed by such companies as Time Warner Inc., Bertelsmann AG and Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
For the time being, the award settles concerns that Poland's air waves could be too strongly influenced by foreign programming.
Poland's 1992 broadcast media law allows up to 33% foreign ownership of a TV venture.
However, there is a possibility that Polsat could seek so much foreign help that they too could be considered less than a true Polish enterprise.
That's because the new network is expected to require an initial investment of up to $100 million for equipment and programming.
A spokesman for Polsat said yesterday that the enterprise plans to raise about $20 million in a private stock placement in the coming months.
