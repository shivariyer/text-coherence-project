A federal district court judge has enjoined Sprint Corp. from using the World Cup USA trademark on its telephone calling cards.
Judge John S. Martin Jr. in New York said that MasterCard International Inc., which brought the action and is one of 11 World Cup sponsors, had the exclusive right to use the soccer competition's trademark on "card-based payment and account access devices."
Sprint, of Kansas City, Mo., had argued that its prepaid cards aren't credit devices but are used solely to access Sprint services.
The World Cup competition is to be held nationwide in June.
