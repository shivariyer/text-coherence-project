Italy's foreign-trade surplus with non-European Union countries widened to 4.402 trillion lire ($2.60 billion) in December from 2.150 trillion lire a year earlier, according to the state statistical office, Istat.
Istat said that for 1993 as a whole, the trade account with non-EU countries swung to a surplus of 20.351 trillion lire from a deficit of 2.725 trillion lire the year earlier.
Istat noted the results could be attributed to strong export gains for all sectors.
