Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. said it agreed to sell its huge facility in Horseheads, N.Y., once tagged as the world's largest food-processing plant, to Megacenter Partners L.P. Terms weren't disclosed.
An A&P spokesman said Megacenter, a New York investment firm, plans to convert the plant into a warehouse facility.
Megacenter was not immediately available for comment.
In the mid-1960s, A&P was flying high, operating about 6,500 stores, and it opened the 1.5 million square foot plant in 1965, considered the largest food-processing plant in the country, to make A&P private-label products.
But instead of widened growth, the stores began suffering declines in the 1970s.
By 1982, the plant was down to a few hundred people and running at just 20% of capacity.
In 1982, the plant was closed and hasn't operated since.
Great Atlantic entered negotiations with Megacenter last fall and expects to complete the transaction in early April.
