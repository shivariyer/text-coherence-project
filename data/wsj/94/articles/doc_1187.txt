Lechters Inc., a housewares retailer, said its net income fell 23% in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 29, despite a 7.7% sales increase.
The Harrison, N.J., company reported net income of $8.9 million, or 52 cents a share, down from $11.5 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose to $133.7 million, from $124.1 million, as the company operated more stores.
Lechters said 567 stores were in operation at Jan. 30, up from 513 a year earlier.
Comparable-store sales fell slightly in the fourth quarter, the company said.
For the year, net was $11.1 million, or 65 cents a share, down from $15.4 million, or 90 cents a share.
Sales rose 14% to $350.2 million from $306 million.
Philip J. Reilly, vice president and chief financial officer, said the biggest factor behind disappointing volume has been the tendency for sales at so-called outlet stores to fall off after successful first-year performances.
The company has 107 outlet stores, mostly opened after 1990.
