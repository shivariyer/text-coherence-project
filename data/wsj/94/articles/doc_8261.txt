NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield signed a new three-year contract with the network, ending a year of speculation that he was on his way out.
Many had expected Mr. Littlefield to leave the General Electric Co. unit after Don Ohlmeyer was named NBC's West Coast president last February, adding a layer of management between Mr. Littlefield and NBC President Robert Wright.
Mr. Littlefield, 41 years old, said he "had very serious doubts" at the time Mr. Ohlmeyer was named, "but Don made it work."
Mr. Ohlmeyer's appointment allowed him to concentrate on "the creative process" of developing shows, and "see the fruits of those labors," Mr. Littlefield said, adding that "I wanted very much to stay at NBC."
NBC is in third place among the three major broadcast networks this season, although it performed well among advertiser-sought-after demographic groups in the important November ratings period, and has a hit in its new sitcom "Frasier."
