Ford Motor Co. rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter from a year-earlier loss, but its stock slid because investors were looking for even better results.
Ford's fourth-quarter profit of $719 million, or $1.30 a share, which included a small gain on the sale of a parts business, was on the high side of analysts' expectations.
It compares with a year-earlier loss of $840 million, or $1.85 a share, after certain special charges.
But the stock market's reaction shows that reporting solid year-to-year gains is no longer enough to boost auto stocks, which have lately traded at historic highs because demand for autos is expected to continue to rise.
Ford fell $1 apiece to $68.50 yesterday in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Shares of General Motors Corp., which is to report fourth-quarter results today, fell 50 cents apiece to $64.25 in Big Board trading.
"This was one of the most widely anticipated earnings surprises in recent history," said Jack Kirnan, a Salomon Brothers auto analyst.
"Ford would have had to blow right through the highest estimate on the Street for the stock to rise."
Ford's world-wide revenue for the fourth quarter was $27.8 billion, up 9.6% from $25.4 billion a year earlier.
For all of 1993, Ford said it earned $2.5 billion, or $4.55 a common share, compared with a record loss of $7.4 billion, or $15.61 a share, for 1992.
The 1992 loss was largely because of a huge one-time charge to account for future retiree benefits.
For all of 1993, Ford posted revenue of $108.5 billion, compared with the $100.1 billion in 1992.
Ford Chairman Alexander Trotman called the 1993 results "the strongest turnaround in Ford's history."
He credited Ford's improved profitability to strengthening or stabilizing economies around the world.
"Looking ahead, we're in good shape for 1994," Mr. Trotman said.
"We have strong new products, and we expect better economic conditions."
Still, Ford's strong fourth-quarter profit of $719 million fell short of much smaller Chrysler Corp.'s recently reported $777 million profit for the period.
"Ford's North American operation is showing some material improvement," Salomon's Mr. Kirnan said.
"It's not where Chrysler is, but the gap is narrowing."
Notably, Ford posted a solid improvement in its U.S. automotive profits, which soared to $669 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $405 million in the 1992 quarter.
The fourth-quarter results for 1993 also included a one-time $73 million gain from the sale of part of Ford's North American automotive seating and seattrim business.
Ford's U.S. factories operated at 108% of their available straight-time capacity during the latest quarter, and are projected to continue at that level in the current quarter.
Ford's cash rebates or sales incentives dropped to $865 a vehicle in the fourth quarter, down from $1,150 a vehicle in the year-earlier period.
But Ford still earned much less than Chrysler on every vehicle it sold in the fourth quarter despite being the industry's low-cost producer.
Ford earned a pretax average $887 a vehicle during the fourth quarter on worldwide sales of 1,454,000 cars and trucks.
Chrysler earned an average of $1,727, before taxes, on each vehicle it sold in the U.S. and Canada.
Analysts attribute Chrysler's higher profitability per vehicle mostly to its newer lineup of higher-profit vehicles and small exposure in markets outside the U.S.
Ford officials have grown sensitive to such comparisons.
And yesterday, David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance, maintained, "I expect that trend to change dramatically over the next couple of years" as Ford boosts production of more profitable minivans and sport-utility vehicles.
Ford is pumping money into developing and launching new products.
Its cash flow from automotive operations was up $1.11 billion from 1992, to $6.86 billion, but virtually all of that was funneled into higher capital expenditures.
Capital spending amounted to $6.71 billion in 1993, compared with 1992 outlays of $5.70 billion.
"We're at a record level of product launches, and we've just emerged from a relatively weak period in the cycle," said Enders Dickinson, Ford's manager of investor relations.
"As the recovery continues, we would expect our financial results and cash flow to improve."
Overseas, Ford's fourth-quarter loss narrowed to $372 million from $909 million a year earlier.
Ford posted a smaller $143 million loss at Ford of Europe, compared with a year-earlier loss of $749 million, even though European vehicle sales were down 16% in 1993 compared with 1992.
Ford's Jaguar Cars Ltd. unit posted a loss of $145 million after a $109 million restructuring charge, compared with a loss of $112 million in 1992.
Meanwhile, Ford's Financial Services Group posted a profit of $1.6 billion for all of 1993, up from $1.24 billion a year earlier.
That includes a loss for the First Nationwide banking unit of $55 million, compared with a loss of $81 million in 1992.
