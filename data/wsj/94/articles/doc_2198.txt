Southern Pacific Lines, San Francisco, and three other companies agreed to pay $38 million for costs related to a 1991 tank-car derailment that contaminated the upper Sacramento River with weed killer.
As part of a consent degree filed in federal court in Sacramento, Calif., the Southern Pacific Rail Corp. unit will pay $30 million in the next five years; GATX Corp., the Chicago owner of the tanker, will pay $5 million; and J.M. Huber Corp., the Edison, N.J., company that leased the tanker, will pay $1 million.
In a separate settlement, the maker of the weed killer, Amvac Chemical Corp., a unit of American Vanguard Corp. of Los Angeles, agreed to pay $2 million.
When the Southern Pacific tank car derailed in July 1991, it split open and spilled a weed killer that poisoned most aquatic life in a 42-mile stretch of the upper Sacramento River near Dunsmuir, Calif.
The money will go to ten California and federal environmental, wildlife and judicial agencies for legal expenses and costs related to cleaning up the spill, assessing its damage, restoring the river and setting up a fund for the costs of future incidents.
