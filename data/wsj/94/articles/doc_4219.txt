Bass PLC, London, announced plans to set up a joint venture with Grolsch NV of the Netherlands to market the Grolsch lager brand in the U.K. and Ireland.
Bass, which is Britain's largest brewer, said it expects the venture, called Grolsch (UK) Ltd., to increase "significantly" its share of the six-million-barrel-a-year premium lager market in the U.K.
"Grolsch is a well-established, high-quality brand that gives us immediate access to significant volumes of the important premium lager sector," said Bass Brewers Ltd.'s chairman, Tony Portno.
Bass Brewers will take a 49% stake in the venture under terms of the pact, and Grolsch will take the remaining 51%.
