Bangkok Bank PCL, Thailand's largest bank, said its president, Vichit Suraphongchai, is taking a six-month leave of absence to seek treatment for an undisclosed illness.
The bank's announcement added to confusing signals about the 48-year-old Dr. Vichit, who took the helm 14 months ago.
Prior to the bank's announcement, Dr. Vichit's office said he had resigned, and the Stock Exchange of Thailand reported that Bangkok Bank had told it the same.
Bank officials wouldn't explain the discrepancy, and Dr. Vichit couldn't be reached for comment.
Although associates of Dr. Vichit say he doesn't appear to be well, many analysts think the timing of the announcement reflects growing friction between Dr. Vichit and the Sophonpanich family, which has run the bank since it was founded in 1944.
However, Dr. Vichit's departure, whether temporary or permanent, isn't expected to have a great impact on the bank's operations, analysts said.
The bank said other senior executives will fill in for Dr. Vichit during his absence.
