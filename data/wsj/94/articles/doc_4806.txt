An Indonesian businessman who obtained a big controversial loan from a state-owned bank has been arrested, Indonesia's attorney general's office said.
Authorities arrested Eddy Tansil, head of the Golden Key Group.
A spokesman for the attorney general's office gave no details of what charge might be filed against Mr. Tansil or an unidentified official of the Indonesian Development Bank, who was arrested a day earlier.
Since Attorney General Singgih stepped into the loan case earlier this week, several other officials of the bank, known as Bapindo, have been questioned by authorities.
Mr. Singgih said Wednesday that four Bapindo officials have been put on a list of persons not permitted to leave the country.
A member of Parliament, Arnold Baramuli, asserted earlier this month that Bapindo arranged an unusual $430 million letter of credit for Mr. Tansil to build a petrochemical plant.
Mr. Baramuli said that the loan may have saddled the state with a loss of 1.3 trillion rupiah ($614 million).
According to Mr. Baramuli, the letter of credit was altered in a way that allowed funds to be drawn overseas before equipment for the plant was shipped.
After the allegation was made, Mr. Tansil told reporters that the loan was smaller than $430 million and that it wasn't a bad debt.
He said part of the plant he is building in West Java with the money could open in March.
Indonesia's central bank governor and finance minister have said that bank secrecy laws prevent them from making any comment about the loan.
