Fluor Daniel, a unit of Fluor Corp., said it definitively agreed to make a 35% equity investment in Prochem SA, an engineering and construction company in Warsaw.
A spokeswoman for Fluor said the investment totals "less than $3 million."
Fluor Daniel said the companies will begin working together immediately and will provide engineering, procurement, construction management, maintenance, validation and startup services in Poland and other central European countries.
The companies expect to complete the deal by year end, probably around midyear, the spokeswoman said.
