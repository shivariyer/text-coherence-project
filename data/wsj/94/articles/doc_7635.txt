Shopsmith Inc. said it is closing nine retail stores and selling 12 others, resulting in a "substantial" restructuring charge for its third quarter, ended Dec. 31.
The amount hasn't been determined, according to the maker of woodworking tools.
The Dayton, Ohio, company said operating results, excluding the restructuring charge, are expected to be "substantially below" the year-ago period.
In the year-ago quarter, Shopsmith earned $107,000, or five cents a share, on revenue of $15.7 million.
The 12 stores are being sold to Woodcraft Inc., a Parkersburg, W.Va., woodworking retailer and mail order company.
Shopsmith will have 23 stores following the closings and sales.
