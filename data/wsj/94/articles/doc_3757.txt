Pacific Investment Management Co., a leading bond manager known as Pimco, is discussing a merger with the smaller Thomson Advisory Group L.P., according to a statement by the companies.
Possible terms weren't disclosed.
Thomson's stock jumped $2.875, or 8.9%, to close at $35.25 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Such a merger would round out each company's product line and open up new sales avenues, fund experts said.
Together, the combined businesses would manage about $70 billion.
Thomson Advisory and Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co., Pimco's parent, confirmed a report in Barron's magazine, saying they are engaged in talks that "could lead to a combination" of Thomson's business with the investment-advisory businesses currently carried on by Pacific Mutual through subsidiaries.
Neither side would say which business is up for sale, but one said a merger is more likely than a joint venture.
"The word `merger' is accurate," David Sanson, a Pimco spokesman, said, declining further comment except to say that discussions are in the early stages.
There is no guarantee a transaction will occur, both sides said in a joint statement.
Thomson Advisory, based in Stamford, Conn., has $10.6 billion under management and is known as a strong stock-fund manager.
Pimco, based in Newport Beach, Calif., oversees $54 billion and is known as a leading institutional money manager.
Other Pacific Mutual subsidiaries included in the talks are Cadence Capital, Parametric and NFJ Investment Group and Blairlogie Capital, with a combined $4.2 billion in assets under management.
"They're both very good groups," Don Phillips, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds, a Chicago newsletter, said of Pimco and Thomson Advisory.
"Their strengths would not overlap.
It would be a nice blend, more akin to Franklin Resources Inc. and Templeton."
Franklin, a fund group known for its bond-fund management, bought the Templeton international funds in 1992.
