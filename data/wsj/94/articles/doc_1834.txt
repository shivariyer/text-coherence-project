Reflecting severe competition in the largest U.S. newspaper market, the New York Times and Newsday both said they would trim white-collar staff through buyout offers.
The New York Times, flagship paper of New York Times Co., said it offered buyouts to 700 nonunion employees in its news, circulation and advertising departments.
A spokeswoman said the offer is part of a previously reported effort to trim staff by about 10%.
Meanwhile Newsday, which primarily has had losses at its New York Newsday edition, offered buyouts to about 500 workers in its circulation, transportation and finance departments.
A spokeswoman said the company hopes about 114 will accept the offer.
Newsday, a unit of Times Mirror Co., has 2,700 employees, down from 3,300 in 1990.
The Times buyout, open until May 6, offers two years' pay for those with 35 years or more of service.
On the low end, those with six years' service or less could take 15 weeks' base pay in the buyout.
The Newspaper Guild said buyout offers for some of the union's 1,600 editorial and commercial workers at the Times were being discussed.
The Times declined comment.
The Newsday buyout offers 2 1/2 weeks pay for each year on the job up to a maximum of 60 weeks.
In American Stock Stock Exchange trading, New York Times gained 25 cents to $28 a share.
