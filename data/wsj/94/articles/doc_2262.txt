Sun Microsystems Inc. will introduce today a sort of semiportable workstation aimed at an increasingly mobile work force.
Weighing 13 pounds and equipped with a full-size flat panel-display screen and keyboard, the new SparcStation Voyager workstations are too cumbersome to be used as laptops.
And at $10,000 to $15,000, they won't appeal to the mass market.
Instead, Sun is targeting engineers and other professionals who want to take their work home or on the road, but need the computing and networking power of a workstation.
The unveiling comes as Sun is casting about for new strategies to guard its No. 1 position in the workplace market.
In last year's fourth quarter, its share of that market slipped -- for the first time -- to 31.8% from 32.1%, according to research firm DataQuest Inc., San Jose, Calif.
Analysts said the portable-workstation market is small and they don't expect the Sun machine to sell in large volumes.
Scott McNealy, Sun's president and chief executive officer, conceded that the workstation's biggest buyers probably will be current customers.
"But if this product adds 10% to 15% to our installed base" of 1.5 million workstations, "that's pretty successful," he said.
Several computer makers have introduced portable and laptop versions of workstations in recent years.
Last week, International Business Machines Corp. said it will offer a seven-pound laptop workstation with a 9.4-inch screen for $12,000.
But Sun says its product is the first to use certain new features, such as a power-saving chip and a screen that doesn't emit radiation.
Also, in a nod to the increasing popularity of hand-held computers, Sun equipped the new workstations with infrared technology that can "beam" information to or from certain hand-held machines.
