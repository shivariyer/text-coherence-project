In an important step toward repairing Mexico's microeconomy, Mexican banks have agreed to restructure some $6 billion in loans to small and midsize businesses over the next two months.
While Mexico's macroeconomic success is praised the world over, many small businesses here suffer from high interest costs, an archaic legal system and petty corruption.
Analysts have said that eliminating these barriers is essential to deeper economic development in Mexico, where growth in gross domestic product slowed to just 0.4% last year.
Giant companies such as Cementos Mexicanos can borrow at low dollar interest rates in international bond markets.
But a small cement company here is likely to be saddled with interest rates of as high as 20% for a short-term bank loan, at a time when government forecasters are predicting 5% inflation this year.
The accord could start a trickle of credit back to small businesses that have been surviving with very little bank financing for the past three years.
The bankers also promised to halt legal proceedings against small companies.
There's something in the accord for the banks, of course.
Restructurings could resuscitate many of the small business loans out of nonperforming status, and free up reserves pledged against bad loans, analysts say.
