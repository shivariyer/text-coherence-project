Conde Nast Publications Inc. said it has acquired a minority interest in Wired, a year-old San Francisco-based magazine that covers the multimedia market.
Terms weren't disclosed, but the magazine will continue to be controlled financially and editorially by its co-founders Jane Metcalfe and Louis Rossetto.
Launched last January on a shoestring, Wired has built its subscriber base to 30,000 and now sells 60 advertising pages per issue.
The magazine has tried to do for "cyberspace" what Rolling Stone did for rock music, illustrating the culture surrounding emerging multimedia technologies without techie jargon.
"We like to think we're becoming the voice of the digital revolution," says Mr. Rossetto, who is editor and publisher.
He said the investment has already allowed Wired to hire its first circulation director, and the magazine plans a major directmail campaign to boost circulation.
Conde Nast is the magazine publishing arm of the Newhouse family's Advance Publications Inc.
A spokeswoman said it was the first time Conde Nast has acquired a minority stake in another magazine in this country.
It prefers to buy them outright, or start its own.
