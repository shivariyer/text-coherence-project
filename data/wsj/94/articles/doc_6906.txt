McGraw-Hill Inc. said fourth-quarter profit was flat, as weak results in its expanding textbook business offset gains in financial services.
The publishing and information company posted fourth-quarter net income of $44.9 million, or 91 cents a share, up slightly from $44.7 million, or 91 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue rose 18% to $682.6 million from $578.7 million.
The 1992 results included a $12.8 million loss from McGraw-Hill's 50% share of a textbook and educational-materials business.
In 1993, McGraw-Hill bought the other 50%, and the 1993 results reflect the entire operation's performance.
For the year, McGraw-Hill net fell 60% to $11.4 million, or 23 cents a share, from $28.6 million, or 58 cents a share.
Results for 1993 include a charge of $160.8 million related to the textbook-business stake.
The 1992 results include a charge of $124.6 million from an accounting change.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading, McGraw-Hill's stock was quoted at $69.125, down 25 cents.
