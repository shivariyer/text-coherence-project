Hershey Foods Corp.'s fourth-quarter profit increased 12% despite soft sales in the U.S. candy business.
The Hershey, Pa., concern said net income climbed to $92.2 million, or $1.04 a share, from $82.3 million, or 91 cents a share, a year ago.
Sales grew 6.9% to $1.04 billion from $969.5 million.
Hershey attributed the sales gains to its strong pasta business and contributions from recently acquired food businesses in Europe.
The results were in line with expectations and Hershey stock closed Friday at $48.625, down 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Despite a generally bad year for candy sales, Hershey Chocolate U.S.A. gained market share for the year.
The pasta group gained market share as well.
