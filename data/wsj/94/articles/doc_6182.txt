Ford Motor Co. said it will stop selling its Mercury Capri convertible in the U.S. this fall because of declining sales.
Ford of Australia, which makes the Mercury Capri at its Broadmeadows assembly plant near Melbourne, will cease Capri production in May.
The vehicles will be available through the 1994 model year, which ends in September.
"Since the introduction of the Capri in 1990, U.S. sales in the convertible segment where Mercury Capri competes have declined, resulting in this decision," said Keith Magee, vice president and general manager of the Lincoln-Mercury division.
Ford sold 9,723 Capris in 1993, down 22.5% from the 12,557 sold in 1992.
Lincoln-Mercury said its dealers will continue to service Capris in the U.S.
