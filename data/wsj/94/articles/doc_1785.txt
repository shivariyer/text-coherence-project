Harris Corp. said it won a $40 million contract to provide the Royal Netherlands Army with secure communications systems.
The pact also gives the army an option for an additional $40 million worth of Harris equipment.
Harris's RF Communications Division in Rochester, N.Y., will design, manufacture and deliver the systems, which provide secure digitized voice and high-speed data communications.
