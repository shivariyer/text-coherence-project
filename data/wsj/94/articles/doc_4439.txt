Morton International Inc. said it received a contract from Nissan Motor Co. to supply airbag inflators for the Japanese auto market.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Morton said it will provide mini-inflators for the drivers-side minibag beginning in the model year 1995.
The minibag has a smaller surface area than conventional airbags used in the U.S. and Europe.
