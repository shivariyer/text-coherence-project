Chrysler Corp. is expected to announce next month whether it will increase production of its Jeep Grand Cherokee by expanding the Detroit assembly plant, adding a third shift, or both.
Inventories of the highly profitable Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicle are at a 29-day supply -- well below the 60-65 day supply considered ideal, said Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication.
Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. have already announced plans to boost output of their sport-utility vehicles to meet increasing demand.
GM said it will step up production in March of its GEO Prizm models because of increased demand for the small sedans.
Production of the cars, built at New United Motors Manufacturing Inc. in Fremont, Calif., a joint venture between GM and Toyota Motor Corp., will rise 60% to 11,377 cars in March, from 7,132 Prizms built at the assembly plant last year.
GM, Ford and Chrysler have scheduled overtime at several assembly plants in the U.S. and Canada.
Altogether, the 10 domestic auto makers said they plan to build 258,311 cars and trucks this week, up 23% from the 209,814 vehicles built in the year-earlier week.
