U.S. Banknote Corp. said its chief executive, Morris Weissman, will assume the duties of president and chief operating officer after the sudden retirement of Stanley Kreitman.
A spokeswoman for the company said that Mr. Kreitman's departure was unexpected and that his contract at U.S. Banknote would have expired at the end of December 1996.
He will continue as a consultant to the company.
The company did not say whether a successor to Mr. Kreitman, 62 years old, will be named or whether Mr. Weissman, 52, will continue to fill those duties.
Mr. Kreitman's retirement comes in the wake of the company's loss of U.S. Postal Service printing work, valued at as much as $330 million over five years.
