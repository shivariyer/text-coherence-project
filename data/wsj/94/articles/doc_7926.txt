Public Service Co. of Colorado, Denver, said it will offer its employees early retirement or voluntary severance packages as part of an effort to cut its work force.
The company said it plans to reduce the number of employees by as many as 750.
PS Colorado has about 6,325 employees.
About 600 employees will be eligible to take the packages on a voluntary basis.
The packages will be available starting Feb. 4.
Employees who choose to take a package will leave the company by March 31.
Later this year, Public Service may look at offering additional packages and possible layoffs.
