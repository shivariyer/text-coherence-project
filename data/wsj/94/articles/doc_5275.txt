Applied Materials Inc., benefiting from strong demand for its computer chip making equipment, said fiscal first-quarter profit tripled on a 57% surge in sales.
Net income for the period ended Jan. 30 was $44.4 million, or 53 cents a share, after a one-time gain from an accounting change of $7 million.
In the year-earlier period, net was $14.7 million, or 18 cents a share.
Sales were $340.4 million, up from $215.6 million a year earlier.
In a statement, James C. Morgan, chairman and chief executive officer of the Santa Clara, Calif., concern, said his customers are investing heavily in semiconductor manufacturing equipment to meet a "strong and growing world-wide demand for advanced logic, microprocessor and memory devices."
Mr. Morgan said he expects this year will be "another significant growth year," but warned that "we do expect the very high current order rates to moderate."
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Applied Materials closed at $47.50, up $1.25.
