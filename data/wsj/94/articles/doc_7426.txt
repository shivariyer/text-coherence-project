Shell Oil Co., Houston, said fourth-quarter net income more than doubled to $152 million from $71 million on a 7.9% drop in revenue to $5.15 billion from $5.59 billion.
The unit of the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell Group said cost-cutting helped the bottom line, as well as an improved performance in its chemical sector.
Sales of refined products also grew.
Those benefits, however, were partly offset by sharply lower oil prices.
Earnings from the exploration and production sector fell $33 million to $115 million.
In the quarter, special items reduced earnings by $28 million.
A year earlier, the company had charges of $88 million.
In 1993, net was $781 million, compared with a loss of $190 million in 1992.
The 1992 results included charges of $635 million related to accounting changes, the company said.
Revenue declined 2.8% to $21.09 billion from $21.70 billion.
