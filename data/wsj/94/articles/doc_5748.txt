French cosmetics giant L'Oreal SA said in Paris that its consolidated revenue rose 6.9% to 40.16 billion francs ($6.73 billion) in 1993.
The group also said that although last year's profit hasn't yet been determined, it expects group profit "to have grown significantly more" than the 6.9% gain in revenue.
In 1992, L'Oreal posted group net income of 2.19 billion francs.
On a comparable structure and constant exchange-rate basis, L'Oreal said consolidated revenue grew 7%.
It noted that consolidated sales from cosmetics rose 7.3%, while sales from its Synthelabo unit increased 6.8% -- both on a comparable basis.
