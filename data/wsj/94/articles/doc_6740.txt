Yields on taxable money-market funds edged lower and assets fell in the week ended Tuesday.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compound yield on taxable funds eased to 2.71% from 2.72%, according to Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass., newsletter.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
The seven-day simple yield on taxable funds was unchanged at 2.68%, while the 30-day simple yield slid to 2.69% from 2.71%.
The 30-day compound yield edged down to 2.73% from 2.74%.
Assets of the 637 taxable funds surveyed plunged $11.83 billion, to $486.43 billion, the newsletter said.
Institutional investors accounted for almost all of the outflow as they withdrew $11.13 billion, while individual investors took out the remaining $698.9 million.
Walter Frank, chief economist for Money Fund Report, attributed the outflow to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning on Monday that short-term interest rates would rise.
For institutional investors, yields on 90-day Treasury bills and other short-term securities are already more attractive than money-market yields.
Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments, which include commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and Treasury bills, was lengthened by one day to 61 days.
The average tax-exempt seven-day compound yield rose to 1.86% from 1.77%, in the latest week.
The latest tax-free yield is equivalent to a taxable 2.91% for someone paying 36% in taxes and to 3.08% for those paying 39.6%.
Assets of the 342 tax-exempt funds surveyed (two more than the previous week) totaled $109.40 billion, according to the newsletter.
The tax-free funds' average portfolio maturity was shortened by one day to 57 days.
