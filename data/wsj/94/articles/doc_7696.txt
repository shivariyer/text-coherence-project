Pacific Enterprises said it agreed to a settlement that will pay $45 million for shareholder lawsuits related to the utility company's failed diversification effort.
Included in the settlement are the company's auditors Deloitte & Touche, as well as insurers, Pacific Enterprises said.
Pacific Enterprises said its net cost in the settlement will be $17 million, which the company said won't have a material effect on its financial position or its dividend policy.
Reserves for the settlement have been taken earlier, a spokesman said.
A spokesman for Deloitte & Touche declined to confirm the accounting firm's participation in the settlement or to disclose the portion of the $45 million for which the New York-based accounting firm might be liable.
The proposed settlement is subject to approval by the federal district court in Los Angeles, where various litigation has been consolidated.
The shareholder suits alleged that officers, directors, and former directors of Pacific Enterprises breached their fiduciary duty with an ill-starred diversification program.
Pacific Enterprises' sudden and improbable swerve into discount drug and sports equipment retailing as well as oil and gas operations absorbed more than $2 billion and threw the company near the brink of a bankruptcy filing.
In the past two years, Pacific Enterprises has disposed of various assets, restructured its debt, and re-established its dividend.
The company said the settlement doesn't directly affect Southern California Gas Co., the regulated utility whose business is now Pacific Enterprises' sole, major operating entity.
"Putting these lawsuits behind us now removes the uncertainty, cost burden and management diversion associated with defending these complex matters in a jury trial," said the chairman and chief executive officer, Willis B. Wood.
