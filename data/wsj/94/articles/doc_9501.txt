With the deadline just one month away, trade talks between the U.S. and Japan are "going nowhere fast," Joan E. Spero, a top U.S. negotiator, said.
"It's been predictable in that the Japanese are tough negotiators," said Ms. Spero, undersecretary of state for economic, business and agricultural affairs.
"They play judo -- defense -- all the time, waiting until the end of the day and the 11th hour to grudgingly yield something," she added.
Ms. Spero is in Tokyo for a four-day assessment of the discussions on increasing U.S. access to the Japanese market for insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment.
Despite the deadlock, Ms. Spero cited a "possibility of advancement" in two main areas of the framework talks: macroeconomic issues, such as reducing Japan's current-account surplus and boosting imports of goods and services, and cooperation on "issues of global importance," such as environmental protection, overpopulation and AIDS.
