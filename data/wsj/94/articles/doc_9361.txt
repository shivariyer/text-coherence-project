American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it will pay a $175,000 fine and plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge that it violated the Federal Clean Water Act while attempting to clean up contaminated groundwater at a manufacturing plant.
The Justice Department had charged that an AT&T microelectronic-parts manufacturing plant in Reading, Pa., violated the law in 1991.
Equipment used to filter groundwater at the plant discharged "small" quantities of pollutants on the plant's premises, AT&T said.
"We're characterizing it as a technical violation," a spokesman said.
