Cooper Industries Inc.
Chairman Robert Cizik said 1994 net income could plunge as much as 25% because of a slump in oil industry exploration, for which Cooper sells equipment.
The disclosure sent the company's stock down 19% in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange even as it announced a 6.1% rise in fourth-quarter profit.
The plunge in the stock erased more than $1.1 billion of Cooper's market capitalization.
Cooper, a large maker of a host of products for industries ranging from electrical power to autos, said the anticipated decline in its petroleum business will far exceed some improvement in other lines.
"We anticipate a significant decline in earnings," Mr. Cizik said, which could be as steep as 25%.
The plunge in crude oil prices to five-year lows of about $15 a barrel will depress demand for an array of products Cooper sells to the oil exploration and production industry, Cooper said.
At 25% of 1993 revenue, Cooper's petroleum segment was its second-largest.
Many of the world's biggest oil companies have said they intend to keep this year's oil drilling budgets at or below 1993 levels unless crude prices pick up.
Mr. Cizik said he expects that the decline in Cooper's petroleum business will be compounded by the impact of a normal, cyclical downturn in natural-gas compression projects.
Investors reacted particularly harshly to Mr. Cizik's 1994 forecast because they had come to expect steady increases in results from Cooper as one line of business generally improved enough to offset harsher results elsewhere.
But yesterday Cooper stock plunged $9.875 to $41.625 in Big Board trading.
Mr. Cizik's prediction came as the company reported that net income for the fourth quarter increased to $102.2 million, or 78 cents a share, from $96.3 million, or 73 cents a share.
Revenue slid 2.3% to $1.6 billion from $1.64 billion.
For 1993, net rose to $367.1 million, or $2.75 a share, compared with a 1992 loss of $228.7 million, or $2.48 a share, which included a $590 million write-down to reflect changes in accounting principles.
Without the accounting changes Cooper had 1992 profit of $361.3 million, or $2.71 a share.
Revenue in 1993 rose 2.3% to $6.27 billion from $6.13 billion.
The oil segment of Cooper was already feeling the heat last year when it slipped from the biggest to the second-largest portion of the company, down from 30% of the mix in 1992.
The petroleum segment was superseded by automotive products, Cooper said.
Cooper said business segments serving stronger markets showed improvements in the latest quarter, including electrical products, tools and hardware, and auto products.
The company also benefited from lower interest expenses.
Mr. Cizik said, "With modest improvement in the North American economy and no further decline in the European market, our electrical products and tools and hardware segments should continue to do well."
Mr. Cizik said that Cooper will continue "to pursue expansion by acquisition."
Last year the company made what it calls small, complementary acquisitions and would continue that strategy, a spokeswoman said.
