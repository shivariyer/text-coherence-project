Raytheon Co.'s board authorized the repurchase of as many as 12 million shares of its common stock in the open market as market conditions may warrant from time to time.
The authorized repurchase is an addition to the plan approved by the board in November 1992, which authorized the repurchase of as many as two million shares per year over the next five years, to offset the increase in the number of shares outstanding caused by the exercise of employee-stock options.
As of the end of its fiscal year on Dec. 31, Raytheon had 135.2 million shares of common stock outstanding.
