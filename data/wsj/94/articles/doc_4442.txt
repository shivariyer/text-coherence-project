The owners of the NYCE and Yankee 24 funds-transfer networks said their previously announced plan to merge was approved by directors of both cash networks.
New York Switch Corp., the New York owner of the NYCE Network, and NENI Corp., the Wallingford, Conn., owner of the Yankee 24 Network, will combine to create InfiNet Payment Services Inc.
Richard Yank, currently president and chief executive of Yankee 24, will become president and chief executive officer of the new company.
The new company will be one of the largest networks in the U.S., serving more than 1,300 banks and credit unions with approximately 13,200 automatic-teller machines.
