Nearly a year after Italians voted overwhelmingly in favor of a referendum changing their scandal-plagued political system, a date for early parliamentary elections has been set for March 27.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday dissolved Parliament and rejected Premier Carlo A. Ciampi's resignation, asking him to remain as head of a caretaker government until elections are held.
Mr. Ciampi offered his resignation Thursday during a no-confidence vote in Parliament on his eight-month-old government.
The March vote is likely to mark the end of an era in Italy.
Following tumultuous corruption scandals that devasted its image, the governing coalition led by the Christian Democratic Party is almost sure to be ousted from its near half-century domination of Italian politics.
New electoral rules, which change the way Parliament is elected, also will markedly alter the country's political map.
In a letter to the heads of Parliament, Mr. Scalfaro cited the success of the April referendum, the effects of corruption scandals and the results of local elections as reasons for the early dissolution of Parliament.
The referendum called for "a substantial and profound modification of the political election system," Mr. Scalfaro said.
