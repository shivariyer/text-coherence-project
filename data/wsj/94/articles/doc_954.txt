American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it expanded and renamed a voice-message service.
The service, now called AT&T True Messages, enables phone callers who get no answer or a busy signal to leave brief spoken messages, which AT&T stores electronically and forwards later.
The service, previously available only with credit-card or calling-card calls, is now available with direct phone and collect calls, AT&T said.
