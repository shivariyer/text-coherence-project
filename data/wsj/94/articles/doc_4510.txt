PetroCorp Inc. expects to report that fourth-quarter net income fell sharply to $191,000, or two cents a share, on revenue of about $8.4 million, Lealon L. Sargent, chairman and chief executive, said.
That figure would compare with profit of $1.1 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $9.3 million in the 1992 fourth quarter.
The Houston company, which went public in October 1993, had 8.2 million shares outstanding in 1993's quarter, compared with 6.7 million in 1992.
Mr. Sargent said that the natural gas exploration and production company produced the same amount of oil and gas in the 1993 quarter as in the 1992 period, but revenue fell because of lower prices.
PetroCorp received about $15.06 for each barrel of oil it sold in the latest quarter, down from $18.61 a year earlier.
Natural-gas prices fell to about $1.80 per thousand cubic feet from $1.88 a year earlier.
