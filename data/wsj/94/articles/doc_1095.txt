Compaq Computer Corp., responding to booming Latin American demand, said it plans to build a $15 million plant in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
The maker of personal computers said the 150,000-square-foot facility, which will open in September, initially will produce desktop computers.
The plant is expected to employ about 400 people.
Compaq, which already operates subsidiaries in Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil, said its sales in Latin America grew 125% last year, following a 289% jump in 1992.
