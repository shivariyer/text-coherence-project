The Canadian government intends to introduce legislation today to end a 12-day-old work stoppage by longshoremen that has shut down Canada's West Coast ports.
The stoppage has halted shipments of grain, lumber and other commodities.
The dispute involves contract demands of members of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union.
The longshoremen have been without a contract since December 1992.
The employers are represented by the British Columbia Maritime Employers' Association.
The main issue in the dispute is the longshoremen's demand for 2.20 Canadian dollar (US$1.64) increase over three years in their hourly base rate of C$21.41.
The last major West Coast port shutdown, in 1986, was ended by legislation.
