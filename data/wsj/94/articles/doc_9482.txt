In an effort to broaden its corporate card business, American Express Co. introduced a charge card that companies can use to purchase office supplies and equipment.
Although American Express already provides most of the nation's largest corporations with cards for travel and entertainment expenses, the potential for the "corporate purchasing card" is even greater: Travel and entertainment costs total about $110 billion a year while purchases of small-ticket office supplies add up to $250 billion.
But Thomas Facciola, an analyst at S.G. Warburg, said he doesn't expect American Express to realize any profit from the new card before 1995.
Mr. Facciola estimated that the introduction of the card will cost about $50 million.
The new card introduced yesterday isn't the first effort by a card issuer to tap the office-supply business.
First Bank System Inc. in Minneapolis is already processing $50 million of corporate purchases each month through a similar program using Visa cards.
American Express said it will be able to capitalize on existing corporate relationships.
Roger Ballou, president of American Express's Travel Services Group, which handles corporate accounts, also noted that while bank issuers of other credit cards must coordinate their efforts with merchant banks and outside processors, American Express will deal directly with corporate customers.
He suggested, though, that American Express might also issue the new purchasing card through banks, although a spokeswoman later said that the company has had only "preliminary" discussions with some banks about such an arrangement.
