THE COUPON on Ontario Hydro's 1 billion Canadian dollar (US$738.9 million) offering Wednesday will float at the threemonth Canadian bankers' acceptance rate.
Yesterday's Credit Markets column incorrectly said the coupon would be 0.08 percentage point higher, which was the yield when the issue was reoffered at a price of 99.64.
IN YESTERDAY'S Heard on the Street column, Alumax Inc. should have been listed among aluminum stocks that might benefit from turmoil in Russia, and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. shouldn't have been.
Alumax, containing the aluminum operations of Amax Inc., was spun off from Amax in November as a prelude to the merger that created Cyprus Amax Minerals.
