Microsoft Corp. announced two multimedia projects with Japanese giant Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.
"We're trying to form the infrastructure {for multimedia}, and in order to do that, we need to work together," said a Microsoft spokeswoman in Tokyo.
Initially, Microsoft and NTT plan to develop a system for distributing software and other multimedia information via compact disks known as CD-ROMs, which can store a huge quantity of software, graphics and video data.
Under the proposed system, people could buy cheap CD-ROM disks containing a variety of programs and other data that would be "locked" with special computerized code keys.
After viewing previews from the disk, interested users could then download the appropriate key for the software they want over the NTT network.
The two companies also are working on a way to make Microsoft software compatible with an NTT network service that provides enhanced faxing services, such as delivering the same document to multiple destinations.
