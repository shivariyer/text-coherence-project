Maxus Energy Corp., in a response to low crude-oil prices, said it restructured its corporate staff to eliminate several management positions, effective March 31.
The oil and natural gas company said the staff reduction was part of an overall cost-cutting strategy that includes reducing operating expenses and overhead by $35 million in 1994.
In 1993, those expenses were about $290.4 million.
Eliminated were the positions of vice chairman and chief operating officer, one senior vice president and five corporate vice presidents.
Under the new structure, four senior officers report directly to chief executive officer Charles L. Blackburn.
Senior vice president Steven G. Crowell assumes responsibility for producing operations; senior vice president George W. Pasley becomes chief financial officer responsible for finance and administra- tion; and Michael C. Forrest, formerly vice chairman and chief operating officer, was named senior vice president, business development.
McCarter Middlebrook remains vice president and general counsel.
Noel D. Rietman, who is retiring as senior vice president, production, will not be succeeded.
A spokesman for Maxus Energy said the five vice presidents whose positions were eliminated have accepted severance packages offered by the company.
