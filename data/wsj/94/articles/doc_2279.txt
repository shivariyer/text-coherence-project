General Electric Co. signed a consent decree with New York state environmental officials under which the company will spend about $100,000 to prevent contaminated sediment from reaching the Hudson River.
The decree calls for GE to reroute and lengthen a treated-wastewater discharge pipe that runs from its capacitor plant in Fort Edward, Washington County, to within 30 feet of the Hudson.
The state said its investigation showed that water discharged from the pipe comes into contact with contaminated sediments and soils before entering the river.
The contaminants are polychlorinated biphenyls.
The decree was announced Friday by the Department of Environmental Conservation and the state attorney general.
Jack Batty, a GE spokesman, said engineering work began in December and would continue when weather improves.
