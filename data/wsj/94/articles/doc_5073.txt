Campbell Soup Co., aided by an acquisition last year, posted record sales and earnings for the fiscal second quarter.
The Camden, N.J., maker of food products reported profit for the quarter ended Jan. 30 of $203 million, or 81 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $121 million, or 48 cents a share, which included a $353 million charge for divestiture and restructuring.
Sales rose 6% to $1.89 billion from $1.79 billion.
The results mainly reflected the acquisition last year of a majority ownership in Australian biscuit maker Arnotts Ltd., which boosted sales of Campbell's biscuit and bakery operations by 48%.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading, Campbell Soup shares rose 87.5 cents a share to $40.75.
