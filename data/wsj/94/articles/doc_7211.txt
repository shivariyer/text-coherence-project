In regard to "Lean Times at the San Francisco Opera" by David Littlejohn, Leisure & Arts, Jan. 5: Lean times there are richly deserved and for many more reasons than listed in Mr. Littlejohn's article.
The final insult -- to me -- was Maria Ewing's sleazy striptease in "Salome."
Small wonder the Metropolitan Opera released this "must do it my way" singer to L.A. opera.
The Dec. 25 issue of Opera News refers to her shedding the final veil (which is the G-string) in the Dance of the Seven Veils.
We are told total nudity is not vulgar in an opera house.
That's a matter of opinion; after viewing Ms. Ewing spread-eagled in the grand finale (with all her cellulite glory exposed), I vowed never again to set foot in the War Memorial Opera House.
To journey north last April, pay in excess of $100 for a ticket, put up with a downtown hotel in a city full of weirdly behaving street people, is more than worth it when productions are performed with flair, taste and talent.
However, when flamboyant, sensationalized versions are offensively offered, that's "finis."

P.S. I've been an opera lover since Lily Pons, Jan Peerce, Zinka Milanov, Jussi Bjorling, Dorothy Kirsten, etc.
A true singer could be fat and plant herself stage center and still hold the audience.
