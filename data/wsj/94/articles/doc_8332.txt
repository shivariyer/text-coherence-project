Beta Well Service Inc.'s buffeted stock regained lost ground Friday after the company unveiled an agreement to acquire part of a third oil-producing project in the former Soviet Union and said it had acquired a Canadian competitor.
The oil-field services company said it signed a letter of intent to acquire a 25% interest in a joint venture in the Stavrapol region of Russia.
The transaction is expected to close within a few weeks.
It said the project's aim is to boost production from 18 oil fields that currently have 700 wells.
Earlier this month, Beta Well said it signed a letter of intent to acquire joint-venture interests in an 800-well oil project in Kazakhstan and in an oil project in the Komi region of Russia.
Beta Well said it will acquire its interest in the Stavrapol project from closely held Genesis Eurasia Corp., Houston, which presently holds 50% of the joint venture.
It said it will invest an initial US$2.5 million in the project, and after that will share further project costs with Genesis.
Separately, Beta Well said it purchased closely held Sundown Well Service Ltd. for 3.2 million Canadian dollars (US$2.4 million).
Beta said Sundown is a Brooks, Alberta, oil-field services company with 11 service rigs.
Beta Well shares closed at $13.625 Friday, up $1.625, or 14%, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange.
Earlier last week, the company's share price fell more than 14% after the company confirmed that it had lost a large well-servicing contract in western Siberia.
