Compaq Computer Corp. said it will offer on-line technical support for users of its computers through Prodigy, a computer network.
By signing on to Prodigy, Houston-based Compaq taps into the booming on-line, bulletin-board business as a way to keep pace with consumers' increased expectations for service.
A host of other computer companies have also signed up with an on-line service, such as Prodigy and CompuServe, for that purpose.
Such services help computer companies manage the influx of service calls and reduce the cost of providing technical support.
"With the record number of products we have out there, the number of calls to the company have increased," a Compaq spokesman said.
