Cytogen Corp. said it agreed to sell a 9.9% interest in the company to Fletcher Capital Markets Inc., a New York investment firm.
Cytogen, a biopharmaceutical company based in Princeton, N.J., said proceeds will be used to fund both late-stage product development activities and exploratory basic research within the company.
At current market prices, the transaction would be valued in excess of $12 million.
The agreement permits Fletcher initially to buy up to 1.4 million new common shares, and the remainder through April 1995.
The company has about 23.3 million shares outstanding.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cytogen shares fell 87.5 cents, or 16%, to $4.625.
