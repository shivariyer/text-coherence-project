Ford Motor Co., Detroit, said it is recalling a total of about 3,600 trucks and buses in two separate actions.
The first recall involves 3,300 1994-model F-Series pickup trucks whose air bags may not inflate in an accident.
That is because the air bag diagnostic modules were intended for other vehicles.
In the second action, Ford is recalling about 300 1994-model E350 single rear wheel vehicles equipped with school bus preparation packages because the amount of weight required to engage the parking brake violates federal safety standards.
Ford said it isn't aware of any accidents or injuries related to the recalls.
