Glendale Federal Bank posted a fiscal second-quarter net loss of $39.8 million, surprising analysts and increasing the likelihood that the troubled thrift will be acquired in the near future.
The loss, equivalent to $1.26 a share, was less severe than the year-earlier loss of $79.4 million, or $2.32 a share, but deeper than what analysts had anticipated.
Expectations had ranged from a net loss of 20 cents to $1.02 a share for the period ended Dec. 31.
The company said that per-share comparisons to prior periods are misleading because of a recent recapitalization and change in its corporate structure.
Glendale, which has struggled for several years to avoid a government seizure resulting from its huge pile of bad assets, now faces declining profitability on loans and investments that haven't soured.
Meanwhile, at many California financial institutions, unlike at Glendale, rising loan balances have contributed to profit gains.
Net interest income plunged 22% to $66.8 million from $85.7 million a year earlier, reflecting a lower spread, or the difference between what the thrift pays for deposits and what it charges for loans.
Its spread fell to a relatively thin 1.86% from 2.43%.
Further, although total problem assets peaked last February, nonpaying loans have ominously started to creep up again, rising to $646.8 million from $630.4 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter.
Glendale cited increased delinquencies in nonresidential and apartment loans.
The bank's loan-loss provision was $37.5 million, down from $44.9 million in the fiscal first quarter, and $77.2 million a year earlier.
In New York Stock Exchange trading, the company's stock closed at $7.50, down 25 cents.
