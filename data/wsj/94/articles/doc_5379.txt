Waxman Industries Inc. reported a 60% decline in net income for the fiscal second quarter and said it plans to refinance about $165 million in domestic debt.
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the Bedford Heights, Ohio, company reported net income of $74,000, or one cent a share, compared with net income of $186,000, or two cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales fell 6.4% to $85.4 million from $91.1 million.
Waxman, a supplier of parts and equipment to the home repair and remodeling market, said it has been working with Merrill Lynch & Co. and a unit of Citicorp for the past six weeks to refinance its domestic bank debt.
A spokesman for the company declined to outline possible refinancing plans.
Waxman added that it reached an agreement with Canadian lenders that would allow its Ideal plumbing parts unit more financial flexibility by deferring certain debt payments.
