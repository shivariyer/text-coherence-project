MCI Communications Corp. shareholders approved the sale of a 20% stake in the long-distance carrier for $4.3 billion to British Telecommunications PLC.
The alliance between the two companies still requires the approval of U.S., U.K. and European Economic Community regulatory bodies.
The partnership was announced in June 1993, and includes the creation of a joint-venture company to sell communications services to multinational concerns.
