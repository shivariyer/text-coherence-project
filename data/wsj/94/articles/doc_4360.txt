CrossLand Federal Savings Bank, New York, said its directors approved the second phase of a plan under which the formerly insolvent bank will go public.
Under the plan, the bank will create a new parent company, Brooklyn Bancorp Inc., which then will sell common shares to the public.
The plan must be approved by shareholders and regulators.
CrossLand, which has assets of $4.5 billion, sold 12 million shares to institutional investors last year under a plan overseen by regulators.
These shares can't be traded publicly.
Under the plan's second phase, these shares would be converted into shares in the new parent company, which would be publicly traded.
The bank would continue to use the CrossLand name for branches.
CrossLand was taken over by regulators two years ago after it was declared insolvent.
