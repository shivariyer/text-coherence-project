Dutch chemical group Akzo NV said net profit in 1993 fell 15% from the previous year, squeezed by extraordinary charges.
Akzo's profit totaled 549 million guilders ($284 million), or 11.67 guilders ($6) a share, down from 646 million guilders, or 14.06 guilders a share, in 1992.
The results include 144 million guilders of extraordinary charges, compared with 66 million guilders in 1992.
But the company said results were "acceptable" given the effects of recession in many European countries.
Akzo's sales edged 1.2% lower to 16.51 billion guilders from 16.71 billion guilders in 1992, on lower selling prices as well as the adverse effects of acquisitions and divestments.
The company left its dividend unchanged at 6.50 guilders a share.
