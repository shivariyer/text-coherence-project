SmithKline Beecham PLC's Clinical Laboratories unit said positive results from workplace drug tests dropped for the sixth consecutive year in 1993.
The results of more than three million drug tests, conducted at the London-based company's laboratories in Collegeville, Pa., showed an overall positivity rate of 8.41%, down from 8.76% in 1992, the company said.
The report noted that since 1987 the rate of positive workplace drug tests has fallen 53%, and has hovered between 8% and 9% in the past three years.
Marijuana remained the most commonly detected drug among the workers tested, followed by cocaine and tranquilizers.
Positive results decreased in the Southeastern, Central and Northeastern regions of the U.S. Positive results increased in the Western region.
SmithKline Beecham, a health-care concern, releases the drug testing index every six months to the government, media and industries.
