Sandy Corp., Troy, Mich., rejected an unsolicited takeover proposal from Westcott Communications Inc., expressing a desire to remain independent and saying the stock offer undervalued the company.
Westcott, a Carrollton, Texas, operator of specialized satellite-TV networks, offered to acquire the provider of corporate training programs primarily to auto makers by exchanging one Westcott common share for every 2.81 Sandy shares in a transaction valued at about $19 million.
Chairman and Chief Executive William H. Sandy said outside financial analysis showed that after a merger, Sandy would account for one-third of the volume and revenue of the combined company, but only about 4% of the stock.
"We felt we could do better on our own," he said.
Company outlook has improved in recent years, largely from auto makers' rebound.
Westcott Chief Financial Officer Phyllis Farragut said Westcott officers would "determine whether any additional action makes sense," but said a hostile bid isn't being considered.
