Ameritech Corp. said fourth-quarter profit jumped 19% from the prior year, partly because of the improving economy and growing demand for its services.
The Chicago telecommunications company said net income rose to $398.2 million, or 73 cents a share, from $335.5 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 6% to $3.02 billion.
For the year, net was $1.51 billion, or $2.78 a share, compared with a previous year's loss of $400.4 million, or 75 cents a share.
The loss included a $1.75 billion accounting charge for retiree health benefits.
Both the quarter and year per-share earnings were adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split effective Dec. 31.
The company said telephone lines grew 3.3% last year, totaling 17.6 million lines, while cellular-service sales rose 47% to 860,000 customers.
In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Ameritech shares were quoted at $78.875, up $3.75.
