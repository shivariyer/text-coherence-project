A federal court judge in Los Angeles dismissed a lawsuit against Amgen Inc. that accused the biotechnology concern and two of its officers of various securities-law violations.
Plaintiffs filed nine separate lawsuits against Amgen after the company in February 1993 disclosed an expected earnings disappointment, triggering a sharp drop in its stock price.
The suits, which accused Amgen of misleading investors about its prospects, were later consolidated.
The judge dismissed the case after the plaintiffs' lawyers decided that "it was not appropriate to pursue the case," Amgen said.
"The dismissal confirms the position that we have taken from the beginning -- that the case had no merit," said Thomas E. Workman Jr., Amgen general counsel.
