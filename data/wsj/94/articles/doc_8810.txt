Porsche AG posted a wider loss for its year ended July 31, omitted its dividend and forecast more losses for the current fiscal year.
Feeling the downturn in the luxury-car market, the German auto maker said its net loss widened to 238.8 million marks ($136.5 million) from 65.8 million marks a year earlier.
The dividend on common shares had been omitted the previous year as well.
But for the latest year, Porsche also omitted the preferred dividend.
A year earlier, it had paid out 2.50 marks a preferred share.
For the current fiscal year, the company expects losses of 140 million marks to 150 million marks.
But Porsche yesterday claimed it is rebounding.
"From the next fiscal year at the latest, we shall be out of the red and shall again be writing black figures," Chairman Wendelin Wiedeking said.
A surge of new orders for Porsche's redesigned and relaunched 911 Carerra model will lead to a break-even operating profit in the fiscal year beginning in August, Mr. Wiedeking said.
The company won't return to healthy profit margins, however, until 1997 with the introduction of its new "Boxster" two-seater model, which will go into production in 1996, he added.
