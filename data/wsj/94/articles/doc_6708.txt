MERRY-GO-ROUND ENTERPRISES Inc., Joppa, Md., said it suspended its quarterly dividend because of its filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code for protection from creditors.
The retailer of youth fashions last paid a quarterly dividend of 1.33 cents a share in November.
It filed for Bankruptcy Code protection Jan. 11, after failing to win concessions from lenders and encountering difficulty getting shipments of spring merchandise.
Separately, the company said sales for the four weeks ended last Saturday rose 2.2%, to $46 million from $45 million a year earlier, while same-store sales fell 13%.
