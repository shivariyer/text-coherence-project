Hit hard by discounting among competing retailers, Tuesday Morning Corp. reported an 85% drop in net income for the fourth quarter.
The Dallas-based specialty retailer posted net income of $979,000, or 11 cents a share, down from net of $6.5 million, or 71 cents a share, in the yearearlier period.
Sales rose slightly to $71.4 million.
The results were far below the estimates of industry analysts, who had projected profit of about 40 cents a share for the period.
Tuesday Morning shares fell 12.5 cents apiece to $5.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Steve Higgins, president, said aggressive discounting by department stores during the Christmas selling season had forced the company to increase its promotional activities and more steeply discount its own merchandise.
