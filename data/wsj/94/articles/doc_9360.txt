China and France patched up a year-long rift with an agreement that French companies won't sell any more arms to Taiwan.
In return, China will end its de facto ban on giving lucrative contracts to French businesses, which lost millions of dollars in sales and a subway contract after France agreed to sell 60 Mirage fighter planes to Taiwan in late 1992.
The Mirage contract will be honored and spare parts will be delivered, but the French government won't allow future sales, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a news conference in Paris.
Taiwan, a Chinese island province, became the haven in 1949 of the Nationalist Chinese after they lost to the Communists in a civil war.
They still claim to be the legitimate government of China.
The Mirage sale was approved by France's former Socialist government.
The conservatives who won power in French elections last March resisted Chinese appeals to cancel the sale, but showed their concern over the deteriorated relationship by sending a special envoy in December to hold secret talks with Chinese leaders.
The accord was a result of that visit, China's official Xinhua news agency said.
