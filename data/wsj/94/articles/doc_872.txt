PolyGram NV said it agreed to buy the recording and music publishing business lines of Russian multimedia entertainment group BIZ Enterprises.
The Dutch recorded music and filmed entertainment concern also said it has an option to acquire BIZ's direct-mail business.
The new businesses will operate as PolyGram AO and be headed by BIZ's founder and chairman, Boris Zosimov.
PolyGram, a leading music recording company, is 75%-owned by Philips Electronics NV, of the Netherlands.
A spokeswoman for London-based PolyGram wouldn't disclose the cost of the Russian acquisition.
Nor would she say whether PolyGram is interested in any of BIZ's other activities.
In addition to music recording, publishing and direct-mail merchandising, BIZ promotes concerts, publishes newspapers and magazines, produces television programs and is active in advertising.
