R.H. Macy & Co. reported improved results for February, in part because of continued operating cost reductions.
Macy, which is operating under federal bankruptcy-court protection, said results before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization amounted to a loss of $6.3 million.
That loss is less than the company had anticipated and an improvement from a loss of $12.5 million a year earlier.
Macy said it traditionally plans for February losses because of seasonal markdowns.
Improved merchandising and reduced operating costs narrowed Macy's operating loss for the month to $31 million from $34.5 million in February 1993.
Excluding the effect of closed stores, including three stores closed because of the effects of the Los Angeles earthquake in January, total sales rose 5.1% from the same month a year ago.
Sales from stores opened at least a year increased 5.7% from a year ago.
Myron E. Ullman III, Macy's chairman and chief executive officer, said Macy expects sales gains to continue and that March's same-store sales gain would exceed February's 5.7% gain.
He said Macy expects to reach its "earnings targets" through spring.
