The U.S. merchandise trade deficit on a balance-of-payments basis narrowed in the fourth quarter to a seasonally adjusted $32.78 billion, the Commerce Department said.
The improvement from the third period was the result of a surge in exports that outpaced an increase in imports.
Analysts don't expect the trend to continue because of continued economic problems of major U.S. trading partners.
In the third quarter, the deficit on the same basis totaled a revised $35.97 billion.
For the year, the balance-of-payments deficit widened sharply, to $132.48 billion in 1993 from $96.14 billion in 1992.
It was the first time in three years the deficit exceeded $100 billion.
These quarterly figures are based on the merchandise trade figures reported monthly by the department, but they exclude military sales and reflect certain other adjustments.
The department is discontinuing this quarterly report and on March 22 will introduce a new report on monthly international trade in goods and services, which will be adjusted on a balance-of-payments basis.
