Odetics Inc. received a $9.6 million subcontract from Martin Marietta Corp. for space-data recorders for the Landsat-7 program.
Odetics said Landsat-7, which is manufactured by Martin Marietta, is an earth-resource observation program that collects information about the Earth from space.
In a news release, the company said the Landsat-7 program is funded jointly by the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Odetics said its information-storage division, formerly space division, will provide Martin Marietta with three spacedata recorders by mid-1996.
The company said the recorders will be on board the Landsat-7 spacecraft and will store earth-resource information when data links are unable to communicate directly with ground-receiving stations.
