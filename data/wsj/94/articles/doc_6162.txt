China has attracted a second consortium to explore for oil in its remote Northwestern Tarim Basin.
Italy's state-owned oil company, Agip SpA, said it and four other foreign companies signed a contract with China National Petroleum Corp. to explore for and produce oil in a 9,814 square kilometer (3,925.6 square miles) block in the basin, an inhospitable desert area near China's border with Kazakhstan.
In addition to Agip, the consortium includes France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Japan Energy Co. and Texaco Inc.
The five companies have equal 20% interests in the venture.
The contract specifies three exploration periods totaling eight years, plus a production period of 15 years.
The contract can be relinquished at the end of each of the exploration periods.
China opened parts of Tarim to foreign companies last year, claiming the 350,000 square-kilometer (140,000 square miles) basin potentially held more than 70 billion barrels of oil -- an amount that, if proven, would triple the country's reserves and make it vie with Iran.
