Transisco Industries Inc., San Francisco, said Haka Stroi, a 15% partner in its Russian railcar-leasing joint venture, Sovfinamtrans, made a bankruptcy-law filing in Finland.
Under Finnish law, Transisco said, Haka Stroi's filing is akin to filing under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which covers liquidation.
Transisco has a 20% stake in the venture.
The remaining 65% is held by Russian concerns.
Transisco said it has not yet determined whether the filing will have an effect on Sovfinamtrans.
Transisco is a railcar maintenance, operation and leasing concern.
