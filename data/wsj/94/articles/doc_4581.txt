Nabisco Biscuit Co. is betting that its best-known cookie brands can take a spot on the breakfast menu.
The king of the cookie and cracker aisles unveiled four products that it hopes will make inroads in the less-familiar breakfast-snack category.
Three of the products are granola bars geared to kids -- and bearing the names of Nabisco's best-known cookies: Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Nutter Butter.
For the health-conscious-adult market, Nabisco introduced SnackWell's Cereal Bars, a fat-free line bearing the same name as Nabisco's successful cookie line.
Nabisco also announced the return of Toastettes toaster tarts, to become a value-priced line.
Nabisco, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. in New York, said it expects the national roll-out to be completed by the end of the year.
The granola bars will be sold 12 to a box with a suggested retail price of $2.69.
The SnackWell bars, which resemble Nabisco's Newtons, will be sold six to a box with a suggested price of $2.19.
According to Jeffrey Cohen, business director of new business for Nabisco, 24% of all snacking is now done in the morning -- double the levels in 1983.
"We saw a real opportunity to leverage brand names," he said.
Nabisco's effort comes at a time when the breakfast-bar and granola categories are growing strongly.
Fueled in part by Kellogg Co.'s Nutri-Grain cereal bars, sales of granola and other snack bars grew 12%, to $384.7 million, in the year ended Sept. 11, 1993, according to Nielsen Marketing Research.
While it concedes its Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Nutter Butter granola bars might be considered "indulgent," Nabisco says that they contain only four grams of fat and 120 calories.
"We feel we're offering an appropriate balance between very wholesome to too indulgent," said Mr. Cohen, who added that the products were well accepted in consumer testing.
