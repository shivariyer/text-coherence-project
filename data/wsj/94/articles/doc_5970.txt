The Senate voted 95-0 to extend the deadline for civil fraud actions against failed savings and loans, a victory for Republicans demanding a more extensive probe of the Whitewater case.
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) had been demanding an extension of the statute of limitations that was set to expire Feb. 28 in the case of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan.
Madison is the failed Arkansas institution central to the Whitewater case.
Without the extension, he said, the savings-and-loan cleanup agency would be unable to pursue civil fraud and negligence claims against Madison.
In a compromise reached yesterday between Sen. D'Amato and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio.), the language would allow the Resolution Trust Corp. to pursue civil actions against numerous failed S&Ls until Dec. 31, 1995.
The provision is part of a supplemental spending bill to provide $8.6 billion for victims of the Los Angeles earthquake.
A special counsel, as part of a criminal probe, is investigating ties between the failed Madison Guaranty and Whitewater Development Corp. -- an Arkansas real estate development company that was owned by Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, along with Madison's owner and his wife at the time.
