Northern Telecom Ltd., continuing to restructure operations in the face of weak North American markets, reported a steep decline in fourth-quarter profit and said it expects an operating loss in this year's first quarter.
Fourth-quarter profit dropped 59%, to $106 million, or 42 cents a share, from a year-earlier $256 million, or $1.02 a share.
Revenue fell 3.1% to $2.46 billion from $2.54 billion.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, the telecommunications-equipment company closed at $31.375, down $1.375.
For the full year, Northern reported a net loss of $878 million, or $3.54 a share, which included $940 million in restructuring charges.
Year-earlier net income was $548 million, or $2.17 a share.
Revenue for 1993 fell 3.1% to $8.15 billion from a year-earlier $8.41 billion.
The company's chief executive officer, Jean Monty, who has adopted an aggressive stance in revamping Northern since being named in 1993 to run it, described the year's financial results as "disappointing," but expects to return the company to profitability this year.
He noted that although the fourth quarter is traditionally Northern Telecom's strongest, the company was burdened by lower margins, weak Canadian markets and the effects of a six-month-old restructuring, which includes a $158 million software overhaul.
Northern has been plagued by software problems that led to delays in equipment and other deliveries to phone companies.
As a result, it has ceded U.S. market share to American Telephone & Telegraph Co., its main rival in the fiercely competitive $6 billion U.S. market for digital switching systems.
"We've been building our margins up to 36% in the fourth quarter, up from 31% in the second quarter," Mr. Monty said in an interview.
He noted that the company in the past has had margins of 39% to 40%.
A bright spot for Northern was its international business, which contributed about 29% of total revenue for the year, up from 26% in 1992.
However, gains in Europe were more than offset by declines in Canada and other international markets.
Responding to regulatory changes, Canadian phone companies have decreased their capital expenditures for the type of equipment that Northern makes, Mr. Monty said.
Revenue in the U.S. was flat for the quarter.
Northern expects demand to pick up in U.S. markets this year, although the biggest growth areas are Asia-Pacific and Europe.
The Canadian market will be "reasonably soft," Mr. Monty said.
Northern, which cut 2,000 jobs in 1993, has said it plans another 4,000 cuts this year as part of its restructuring.
