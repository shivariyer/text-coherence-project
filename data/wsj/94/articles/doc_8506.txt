Metricom Inc. got a $7 million extension on a contract with SCEcorp.'s Southern California Edison Co. unit.
Metricom said the contract covers the initial phase of a two-year program under which Metricom's UtiliNet division will supply a wireless data-communications network for SoCal Ed's distribution-system efficiency-enhancement project.
A Metricom spokesman said the extension is for additional product orders and boosts the value of the contract to $12 million.
