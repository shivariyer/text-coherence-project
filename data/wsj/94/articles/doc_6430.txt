Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest auto maker, said it will expand the service offered by its cellular and portable telephone venture to the country's southern regions of Kyushu and Okinawa.
Nissan's phone ventures already serve Japan's major metropolitan areas of Tokyo and Osaka.
The company said it will set up Digital TU-Ka Kyushu Ltd., in conjunction with Japan Telecom Co., Hitachi Ltd., Kyushu Railway Co., and other local companies and arms of foreign companies.
Nissan's Kyushu mobile-phone venture plans to start service in 1996.
In the venture, with two billion yen ($18.5 million) of capital, Nissan will have a stake of almost 23%, as will Japan Telecom.
Other Japanese partners include Nishi-Nippon Railroad Co., Nippon Steel Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp.
KDD, Japan's leading international telephone carrier, will have an interest, and several Japanese trading houses will have smaller stakes.
Foreign partners include Pacific Telesis Group's Pacific Telesis International Inc. and GTE Corp. from the U.S. and British Telecommunications PLC, Nissan said.
The service will start in the island's seven major cities and will look to expand to outside cities.
Nissan, which wants to set up a digital phone-service network in Japan, indicated it hopes to serve the area around Nagoya in central Japan while expanding service around Tokyo and Osaka.
