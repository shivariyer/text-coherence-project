Fiat SpA reached a key accord with labor-union and government representatives for temporary layoffs, early retirement and job-sharing programs to cut a total of 16,500 jobs, the Italian auto maker said.
After months of heated negotiating and numerous workers' protests, the accord was reached late Monday night in Rome.
Under the agreement, 8,800 workers from three factories will be permanently let go through early retirement or long, government-subsidized temporary layoffs lasting until retirement.
