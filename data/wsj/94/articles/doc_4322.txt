Eaton Corp. said it would lay off 1,200 workers, close eight facilities and relocate several product lines as part of a restructuring at its electrical-equipment unit.
The restructuring follows the company's recent $1.1 billion acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s distribution and control business.
Eaton, a Cleveland manufacturer of industrial products, said the move was necessary to eliminate overcapacity caused by the merger of its Industrial Control and Power Distribution Operations unit with Westinghouse's Distribution and Control Business Unit.
The company said the restructuring would be covered by a $55 million pretax charge recorded in the 1993 fourth quarter and other reserves.
A spokesman said no additional charges related to the restructuring were expected.
The combined businesses will operate under the name Cutler-Hammer.
Prior to the layoffs, the merged businesses have about 17,200 employees.
