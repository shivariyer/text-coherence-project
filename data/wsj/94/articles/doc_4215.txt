MCI Communications Corp., Washington, said it signed a definitive agreement valued at $1.4 billion over seven years with Insurance Value Added Network Services, an insurance-industry communications network.
The agreement expands a preliminary agreement valued at $1 billion.
A network spokesman said telecommunications concerns American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and Sprint Corp. also vied for the contract.
The network has made MCI the primary telecommunications provider for its 400 member companies in the insurance industry.
The members account for 60% of the industry's $1.5 billion in annual telecommunications expenditures, MCI said.
The network, formed in 1983, combines the volume of its members' use of voice and data communications for value-added purchasing.
It serves 56,000 data-network users.
