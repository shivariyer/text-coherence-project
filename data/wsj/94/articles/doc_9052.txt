Steel plate producers, citing rising demand, last week announced price increases of 2% to 4% for shipments beginning in early April.
The increases were led by USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel unit.
Bethlehem Steel Corp. and Lukens Inc., among other producers, followed.
Oregon Steel Mills Inc. said it would match the increase in markets where it competes with those producers.
"We think there is sufficient strength in the market for this one to stick," said a U.S. Steel spokesman.
Bethlehem Steel said the move was "to partially restore fair value to plate products."
"I'm surprised the price increase hasn't happened before now," said Charles A. Bradford, an analyst with UBS Securities.
Demand is climbing, and U.S. markets are tightening, in part because Geneva Steel Co. is revamping its operations, which is keeping it out of many sectors of the plate market.
Geneva's project is scheduled for completion in March.
Steel plate is used in bridges, pollution-control systems, pressure vessels, ships and construction equipment.
