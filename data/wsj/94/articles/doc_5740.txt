British Petroleum Co., London, said it made a second oil discovery west of the Shetland Islands and said it was considering an early development plan to produce oil from the area.
The find is in a block equally owned by BP and Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
It has estimated recoverable reserves of 250 million to 500 million barrels of oil.
BP said it and Shell were considering options to produce oil from the area, which includes Foinaven, a nearby discovery with similar reserve potential.
The first phase of production may be capable of yielding around 100,000 barrels a day within the next few years.
