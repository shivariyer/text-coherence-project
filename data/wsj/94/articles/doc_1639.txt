C. Olivetti & Co. and Northern Telecom Ltd. said they will jointly develop wireless voice and data transmission products, based on the Digital European Cordless Telecommunications standard.
The products are directed at businesses and will allow communication over portable telephones and the electronic transmission of mail, documents and images over NET3, a local wireless network introduced by Olivetti a year ago, the company said.
A spokesman for Olivetti declined to put a value on the market for the products.
Northern Telecom is based in Canada.
