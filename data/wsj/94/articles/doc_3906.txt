Strong communications stocks and firm bonds combined to push small-company stocks higher, although New York Stock Exchange prices lost ground.
Traders said yesterday's bounce by smaller stocks was partly technical as the group has underperformed in comparison with large, cyclical issues since the year began.
Observers said strong overseas markets paved the way for advances.
The Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks jumped 2.53, or 0.96%, to 265.53, its session high.
The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 8.72, or 1.11%, to 792.50.
Advancing Nasdaq issues whipped decliners, 2,054 to 1,132.
Nasdaq National Market volume was a slim 243,955,212 shares and overall volume was at 287,547,000.
On Friday, National Market turnover registered 244,140,900 shares with total volume at 285,648,000.
Meanwhile, Philip Morris Cos. depressed blue chips, helping the Dow Jones Industrial Average slide 6.76 points.
Overseas, foreign markets shrugged off news that U.S. fighter jets shot down four Bosnian Serb aircraft after Serb pilots were seen dropping bombs over central Bosnia.
Shares rose in Tokyo, Hong Kong, London and Frankfurt.
Yesterday, communications stocks took the spotlight.
"What we saw was a bounceback by the `information-highway stocks' because of the MCI-Nextel news," said Tim Grazioso, vice president and manager of over-the-counter trading at Cantor Fitzgerald Securities.
Some specialized mobile-radio stocks were boosted by news that MCI Communications, up 7/8 to 27 3/8, will invest $1.3 billion in Nextel Communications, which surged 5 5/8 to 44 1/4.
CenCall Communications of Denver rose 3 7/8 to 28 1/2, and Dial Page of Greenville, S.C., jumped 5 1/4 to 54 1/2.
Among losers, American Healthcorp plunged 6 1/4 to 15 1/4 on a poor second-quarter earnings outlook.
The Nashville, Tenn., provider of diabetes-treatment services said it expects profit of 17 cents a share for the period, below 19 cents a year ago and analysts' estimates of 22 cents.
Tops Appliance City tumbled 3 to 10 1/4.
The Edison, N.J., operator of retail megastores for appliances and consumer electronics posted fourth-quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, compared with pro-forma earnings of 55 cents a year earlier.
Lottery Enterprises dropped 1 to 11.
The San Diego lottery-ticket vending terminal maker said its fourth-quarter earnings fell to 12 cents a share on more shares from 28 cents a year earlier.
Disappointing earnings lopped 4 3/4 from the stock of Roberds, sending it to 8 1/2.
The West Carrollton, Ohio, operator of homefurnishing stores said its fourth-quarter profit fell to 25 cents a share on a pro-forma basis from 40 cents a year earlier.
In addition, Raymond James & Associates downgraded Roberds to "hold" from "buy."
Ricky Harrington, a senior vice president and analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane, said part of the late-buying spree was likely attributable to end-of-the-month buying as bargain hunters moved in to snap up some recently beaten smaller stocks.
He said he doesn't think the market's correction is over.
"I think the correction could be deeper and longer than people think," he said.
"We're still in for more of a downward bias."
February was a topsy-turvy month for the stock market.
Two major pullbacks occurred-on Feb. 4, when the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates, and on Feb. 24, when bonds sank.
The Russell 2000 remains 0.99, or 0.37%, below its Jan. 31 level, while the Nasdaq Composite is 7.98, or 1%, shy of its record of 800.48 set Jan. 31.
