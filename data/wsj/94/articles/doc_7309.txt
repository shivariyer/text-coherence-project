South Korea's industrial output showed an 11.7% increase in December from a year ago, providing more evidence that the nation's economy is pulling out of its protracted stagnancy, the National Statistical Office said.
The office said that the December gains followed a year-to-year rise of 10.5% in November.
But industrial output for the whole of 1993 rose by a modest 4.2%.
