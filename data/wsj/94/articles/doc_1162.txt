White House associate counsel William Kennedy III disclosed that he failed to pay $805 in 1991 state and federal taxes owed on wages paid to his family's nanny.
Mr. Kennedy, former managing partner of Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., said he paid the overdue taxes, including Social Security and Arkansas income taxes, three weeks ago.
He is one of the White House officials who screens prospective presidential appointees for ethical problems.
The disclosure follows a report in The Wall Street Journal earlier this week that Mr. Kennedy was delinquent in making Social Security payments for the part-time nanny during the first three quarters of 1992.
In January 1993, Mr. Kennedy paid $2,081 in 1992 taxes, interest and late penalties, including $1,352 in Social Security taxes and $300 in state taxes.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Kennedy said he wasn't trying "to mislead anybody" by paying the overdue 1992 taxes under his wife's previous married name.
