Williams Cos.'s telecommunications subsidiary said it signed an agreement to provide the first fiber-optic line between Cuba and the U.S.
The subsidiary, WilTel International Inc., said the memorandum of understanding with Cuba's state-owned telephone company will allow WilTel and other telephone companies to establish direct, high-quality telephone links between the U.S. in Cuba.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Currently, only a few circuits are available between the two countries.
WilTel said the project complies with State Department guidelines that encourage cultural and communications ties between the U.S. and Cuba.
The line will be placed across the Straits of Florida between the southern tip of Florida and a point near Havana, about 100 miles away.
Besides telecommunications, Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., is an energy company that owns and operates pipelines.
