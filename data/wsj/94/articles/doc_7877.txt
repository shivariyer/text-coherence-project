Electronic Data Systems Corp. said it bought a 31.7% stake in Europe's IBOS electronic-banking system.
IBOS, which stands for Inter-Bank OnLine System, was developed by Spain's Banco Santander and the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC to provide high-speed electronic banking services across national borders.
Under the deal with EDS, a unit of General Motors Corp., the two founding banks will each keep a 31.7% stake in the venture.
Goldman, Sachs & Co., the U.S. investment bank that serves as IBOS's financial adviser, will hold the remaining 5%.
EDS declined to say how much it paid for its one-third stake.
Royal Bank and Santander officials noted that the two banks have spent around #8 million ($12 million) on IBOS over the past four years.
The system serves four banking companies with more than 2,600 locations in the United Kingdom, Spain, France, and Portugal.
Thomas Metz, a former EDS official who serves as IBOS's director of global business development, said he expects the system to expand into the U.S. within six months.
Two U.S. banks, Mellon Bank Corp. and First Fidelity Bancorp., have signed letters of intent to join the system, as has a Santander subsidiary in Puerto Rico.
Though EDS officials' initial IBOS investment is relatively small, they say it is part of a concentrated push by the technology concern to expand its presence in the area of interactive, electronic banking.
