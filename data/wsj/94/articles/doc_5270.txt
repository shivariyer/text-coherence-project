Hydro-Quebec, Montreal, is seeking its first listing on a European exchange, setting up a $1 billion medium-term note program that will diversify borrowings for the Quebec-owned utility.
Hydro-Quebec has applied to list notes with maturities of one month or more on the London Stock Exchange and Paris Bourse.
Borrowings may be done in any currency agreed on by the utility and the purchaser.
A Hydro-Quebec spokeswoman said there aren't immediate plans to draw on the program, and Hydro-Quebec will issue Euronotes as market conditions permit.
Hydro-Quebec has a $2 billion mediumterm note program in the U.S. set up in 1990.
Total debt outstanding at Hydro-Quebec is 33.2 billion Canadian dollars (US$24.54 billion).
The Euronotes have been rated singleA-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp. and single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
The province of Quebec guarantees Hydro-Quebec borrowings.
Citibank is the issuing and principal-payment agent for the program.
