Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. said it will raise prices on all replacement passenger and truck tire lines, except tires for farm equipment, by 3%, effective March 1.
The company previously announced a 2% price increase for tires for farm equipment effective Jan. 1.
Goodyear said it is raising prices "in order to keep pace with general increases in the cost of doing business."
About two weeks ago, the company's Kelly-Springfield Tires Co. said it would increase prices 3% effective March 1 on all of its tires for passenger cars and light and medium trucks.
Dayton Tire Co., a unit of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., also said about two weeks ago that it will raise prices between 3% and 5% on all of its Dayton and Road King lines as well as private-label lines, effective March 1.
Bridgestone/Firestone is a unit of Bridgestone Corp. of Japan.
Asked whether price increases are possible on Bridgestone, Firestone or Seiberling tires, a Bridgestone/Firestone spokesman said, "We have no announcement at this time."
A spokesman for General Tire Inc., a unit of Germany's Continental AG, said, "We are evaluating the situation."
A spokesman for the U.S. unit of France-based Groupe Michelin said, "We're finalizing the study of market trends at the beginning of the year before deciding on any other moves."
Last week, Michelin Americas Small Tires said it will increase prices on private-brand and associate-brand tires (not including Riken and Kleber) by 3%, effective for shipments on or after March 1.
