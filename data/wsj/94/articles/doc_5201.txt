Texaco Inc. announced a new generation of gasolines that it says will extend the life of automobiles while emitting less pollution.
New CleanSystem3, which is actually an additives package that will be added to all of Texaco's existing gasolines, significantly cuts those tailpipe emissions responsible for the creation of smog.
According to David Cole, director of University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation, "the package helps to restore the performance of old cars by cleaning engines that are already dirty and prevents damaging deposits in new ones.
It essentially slows a vehicle's aging process."
Mr. Cole helped Texaco to evaluate the additives package.
The enhanced gasoline will be available throughout the U.S. March 1 at more than 14,000 Texaco service stations and in Europe and parts of Latin America by spring.
