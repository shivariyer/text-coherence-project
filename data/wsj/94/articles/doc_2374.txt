The State Department said it won't approve long-distance telephone-service agreements reached by Cuba and three U.S. companies, including MCI Communications Corp.
At issue is a provision in the agreements that allows Cuba to impose a $4.85 surcharge on collect calls.
U.S. industry officials consider the surcharge a normal practice in many countries.
But State Department officials view the surcharge as an effort by Cuba to collect foreign currency.
A State Department official said the surcharge would violate 1992 legislation that called for better phone service between the two countries, but stipulated against Cuba's receiving "excessive amounts of United States currency or the accumulation of excessive profits."
Along with Washington-based MCI, the agreement involved Wil-Tel International Inc., Tulsa, Okla., and LDDS Communications Inc., Jackson, Miss.
As part of the agreement, callers would be charged a maximum of $1.20 a minute.
The Cuban government would collect half the proceeds.
