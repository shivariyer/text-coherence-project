SABER SOFTWARE Corp., Dallas, said it registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering of 1.8 million common shares, 1.2 million of which will be sold by the company and 600,000 of which will be sold by certain shareholders.
The computer-software concern said it expects the stock to be priced at $9 to $11 a share.
Wessels, Arnold & Henderson and Tucker Anthony Inc. will manage the offering, which includes an option to buy an additional 270,000 shares from the selling shareholders to cover over-allotments.
Saber said it would use proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.
