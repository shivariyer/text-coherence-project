William L. Telander, 44 years old, pleaded guilty to federal charges that he fraudulently sold securities in a foreign-currency trading scheme that bilked 380 investors out of $11 million, U.S. Attorney Thomas M. Brown said.
Mr. Telander, Yountville, Calif., pleaded guilty in federal district court in Los Angeles to four counts of fraudulent securities sales and two counts of failing to file federal income-tax returns.
Mr. Telander is also negotiating a resolution of Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he violated various securities laws in the scheme, Mr. Brown said.
The government alleged that Mr. Telander fraudulently offered and sold unregistered securities in Southwest International Exchange.
The securities purported to be limited partnership interests in a foreign-currency exchange program.
Investors were told they would earn between 25% and 41% on their investments.
However, Southwest International never engaged in foreign-currency exchange transactions, and Mr. Telander used investors' funds to finance various personal investments, to make nominal payments to Southwest International investors, and to cover personal expenses, the government said.
Mr. Telander and his attorney couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
