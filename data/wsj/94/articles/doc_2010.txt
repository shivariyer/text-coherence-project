While there might be a cease-fire among major grocery-store chains in Texas ("All Quiet on the Supermarket War Front," Feb. 16), one grocer has clearly won a battle in Dallas/Fort Worth by capitalizing on an untapped, lucrative residential area.
I am referring to Albertson's Inc.'s decision to open a 50,000-square-foot store in the inner-city Uptown area near downtown Dallas {where Columbus Realty Trust is a multifamily residential developer}.
The success of this store should cause competitors to rethink their "suburban-only" expansion plans in Dallas, as well as in other cities across Texas.
Albertson's Uptown store serves a densely populated two-mile trade area of more than 80,000 residents.
In the two months since the store opened, it has reaffirmed the viability of Uptown and other inner-city growth opportunities to Dallas city officials, developers and leaders.
