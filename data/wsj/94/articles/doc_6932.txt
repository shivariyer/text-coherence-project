Aldus Corp.'s stock slumped 15% after the software publisher's fourth-quarter gross profit margins failed to match strong third-quarter margins.
Aldus posted profit of $4.7 million, or 34 cents a share, for the fourth quarter, more than double the $1.9 million, or 14 cents a share, earned a year earlier.
The latest earnings, which included a restructuring charge of three cents a share, were two cents below analysts' mean expectations.
Revenue for the Seattle company's fourth quarter was up 25% to $57.4 million from $45.9 million a year ago.
The big letdown, analysts said, was Aldus's fourth-quarter margin, which fell to 79% from 82% in the third quarter.
Aldus officials said the company's third-quarter gross margins were unusually strong because of heavy shipments of high-margin upgrades for Aldus's Pagemaker publishing software.
In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market Aldus closed at $22.25 a share, down $4.
