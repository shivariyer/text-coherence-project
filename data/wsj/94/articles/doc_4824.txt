Canada's trade surplus narrowed to 524 million Canadian dollars (US$389 million) in December, partly as a result of a rise in imports from the U.S., Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
The December surplus was the smallest in 17 months.
The November surplus totaled C$708 million.
Canadian imports of U.S. goods rose 3% in December and accounted for 74% of Canada's total imports.
Canadian exports to the U.S. rose 0.7% in December and accounted for 81% of total exports.
