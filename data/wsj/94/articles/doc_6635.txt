Perhaps Wall Street brokerage firms aren't as shy about program trading as they had been.
In a reversal of the trend since the 1987 stock-market crash, most of the computer-aided program trading done last week on the New York Stock Exchange was by Big Board brokerage firms trading for their own accounts, rather than for customers.
In its regular weekly report, the Big Board said 58.8% of last week's program trading was for the firms' own accounts, or "as principal."
The average was 44.5% for all of 1993.
And it wasn't a case of a single firm throwing off the average.
All five of the most-active program trading firms for the week ended Jan. 28 executed "all or most of their program trading for their own accounts," the Big Board said.
These firms were Morgan Stanley Group Inc. (which has said previously that its program-trading operation is geared mainly for customers), Susquehanna Investment Group, UBS Securities, CS Holding AG's CS First Boston Inc. and Cooper Neff & Associates.
Traders couldn't remember a recent week when all five most-active firms traded mostly for their own accounts.
Program trading is the rapid, computer-aided trading of long lists of stocks -- officially, at least 15 stocks with a total value of $1 million or more.
The activity hit a record 11.9% of overall Big Board volume last year.
Unless this is a one-week aberration, the statistics suggest that Wall Street brokerage firms aren't as sensitive to the controversy over program trading as they were after the crash, when many curtailed their principal trading and others ceased trading entirely.
