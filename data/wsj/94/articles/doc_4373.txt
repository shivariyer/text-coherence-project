After a difficult year marred by sagging earnings in its U.S. unit, Avon Products Inc. said its Avon ladies are ringing up more sales.
James E. Preston, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that the beauty products company now expects sales in the first quarter to be up 5% to 7% and earnings from continuing operations to increase 13% to 16%.
Much of the improvement will come from Avon's U.S. business, which is projected to post sales gains of 5% to 7% and pretax profit to grow 25% to 35%.
Last year, Avon posted a first-quarter loss of $92.9 million, or $1.29 a share, which reflected one charge for accounting and another for an arbitration award against the company.
Excluding the nonrecurring items, net income was up 10% to $24.6 million.
"The sales improvement we saw just prior to Christmas has continued," Mr. Preston said in New York.
