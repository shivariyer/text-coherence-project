The government's report on retail sales in February and a big revision to its January estimates indicate that, perhaps because of bad weather, consumers lost some of their enthusiasm for spending more.
The Commerce Department said retail sales totaled $181.6 billion in February, rebounding 1.5% from the previous month's decline.
But the department added that sales dropped 1.9% in January rather than the 0.5% decline reported previously, so much of the increase was just catching up.
"The report left the consumer sector with a little less momentum than had earlier seemed to be the case," Merrill Lynch & Co. economists said.
Most private forecasters are looking for a rebound in retail sales in March as better weather returns.
Forecasters at the University of Michigan said Friday that the U.S. economy is off to "a running start."
They expect the economy to expand at a 3.5% annual rate in the first half, and then to decelerate to a 2.3% growth rate in the second.
Consumer spirits, as measured by the university's surveys, are back up to levels that haven't been seen since before the 1990 recession.
Sales at grocery stores, gas stations, department stores, restaurants and the like, which account for 60% of retail sales, rose 1.2% in February after falling 1.9% in January.
The increases were widespread.
Sales of building and related materials, which increased strongly last year, slipped 2% in February and 6.6% in January, a casualty of the weather.
Furniture sales were up 0.9% in February after falling 4.4% in January; they're still up 10.3% from a year earlier.
Auto dealers' sales rose 3.2% in February after falling 0.5% in January; over the past year they have risen 22.3%.
Excluding auto sales, overall retail sales were up 1% in February; they fell a revised 1.9% in January.
The figures are adjusted to remove the usual seasonal fluctuations, but not for changes in prices.
They are subject to huge revisions as more information is received.
