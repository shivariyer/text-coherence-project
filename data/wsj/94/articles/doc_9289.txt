Aztec Energy Corp., Dallas, reported a loss for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1993, of $1,017,000, or 49 cents a share.
The loss was nearly $200,000 less than the company said it expected earlier this month.
The company said the narrower loss is attributable to certain accounting changes made recently, and to the hiring of a new accounting firm.
Aztec, a natural-gas exploration and production company, also said that certain of the accounting changes prevent it from releasing its final fiscal fourth-quarter earnings yet.
The company said it plans to release them when possible.
Revenue for the full-year ended Sept. 30 was $777,721.
For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1992, Aztec posted a net restated net loss of $179,000, or nine cents a share, on revenue of $3,426.
Aztec, which went public in August 1991, restated its 1992 earnings to reflect the accounting changes.
