A consortium including News Corp. and the Australian government's telecommunication company, Telstra Corp., has started court action to challenge the allocation of Australia's first two satellite pay-television licenses to groups backed by U.S. companies, News Corp. said.
News Corp., Rupert Murdoch's international media and entertainment company, said in a statement that its legal action challenges the links between the two successful license bidders, the level of foreign ownership in each company and the level of disclosure to broadcasting authorities by one of the license holders.
The two satellite pay-TV licenses were awarded by the government to UCOM Pty. Ltd. and Australis Media Ltd. after a protracted and controversial tender process.
UCOM won with a bid of 77 million Australian dollars (US$55.8 million).
It announced in January that Century Communications Corp. of the U.S. will emerge with 20% of the company through a joint venture with Continental Venture Capital Ltd.
The second license is held by Australis Media, which has announced it will fund the A$117.0 million cost of the license by issuing securities to the Lenfest group, which is majority owned by Tele-Communications Inc.'s Liberty Media Corp. of the U.S.
News Corp. said its consortium members think the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the national broadcasting media watchdog, "hadn't been able to properly investigate the suitability of the licensees or their compliance with the pay-TV legislation."
