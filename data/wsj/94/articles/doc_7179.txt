Travelers Inc. canceled a controversial plan to raise homeowners insurance rates on Long Island, giving up its challenge to objections raised by the New York state Insurance Department.
Travelers attempted to raise rates by 20% following Hurricane Andrew in August 1992.
Other insurers raised rates in Louisiana and Florida after the storm, but Travelers was the first to try to raise rates in a state that didn't border on the Gulf of Mexico.
Travelers was held up as an example of "shorelining," a practice where insurance companies try to avoid insuring homes in coastal areas.
"This department will not allow insurance companies to raise homeowners insurance rates unless they can clearly demonstrate they have suffered losses," said New York Insurance Superintendent Salvatore Curiale.
Travelers declined comment on why it backed away from its challenge.
It said it will refund money to policyholders who already have paid the higher rates.
