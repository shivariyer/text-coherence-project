Corning Inc. said its MetPath subsidiary would sell the assets of its Damon clinical laboratory testing operations in California to Physicians Clinical Laboratory Inc., Sacramento, Calif., for approximately $50 million plus the assumption of certain liabilities.
Proceeds will be used to retire some debt from Corning's acquisition of Damon Corp. in August, the company said.
Corning bought the medical lab-testing concern in an effort to become a low-cost medical-service provider.
Corning has about $400 million of long-term debt remaining from the purchase.
Damon also is saddled with subpoenas relating to its billing practices.
Although the legal orders relate to practices before the purchase, Corning is liable for any settlements or fines Damon might pay.
The company has said it will take a charge if and when any fines are levied.
Corning said California wasn't a core geographic area for MetPath.
After selling the two Damon labs in Los Angeles and San Francisco, Corning will continue to strip costs from the acquisition by consolidating the other 11 labs, one of which is in Mexico.
Corning, a diversified concern with interests in specialty materials, communications, laboratory services and consumer products, took an after-tax charge of about $35 million in the third quarter of 1993 for consolidation costs.
