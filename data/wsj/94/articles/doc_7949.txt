Japan's opposition Liberal Democratic Party agreed to meet Wednesday with members of the ruling coalition in an effort to end a stalemate on political reform.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's reform bills already were rejected once by parliament last week, and few expect Wednesday's meeting to be conclusive.
Mr. Hosokawa is struggling to turn his proposed reforms into law before the current session ends on Saturday.
If the bills aren't passed by then, Mr. Hosokawa may resign or dissolve parliament and call elections.
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata conceded Tuesday that dissolving parliament is a possibility.
Wednesday's meeting is aimed at reaching an agreement that would allow both houses of Japan's parliament to vote again on reform.
If both houses pass the legislation by a simple majority, the bills become law.
Without such a compromise, Mr. Hosokawa's remaining option is a last-ditch vote in the lower house of parliament, where the prime minister must receive a two-thirds majority to pass his reforms.
Such a move would require the support of about 70 members of the opposition Liberal Democrats, which isn't likely.
