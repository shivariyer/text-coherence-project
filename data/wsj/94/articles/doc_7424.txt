Collins & Aikman Group Inc. said it sold its Kayser-Roth Corp. subsidiary to Legwear Acquisition Corp. for about $170 million and a warrant to purchase 10% of the equity of Legwear within three years.
Collins said the warrant can be repurchased by Legwear for $10 million.
About $66 million was used to pay bank debt outstanding of Kayser-Roth.
Collins said the rest of the proceeds will be used for general company purposes, including redemption of a portion of Collins & Aikman Group's subordinated notes due 1995 or other debt.
Legwear Acquisition was organized by Grupo Synkro SA and a group of Mexican investors in November.
Groupo Synkro of Mexico City is the largest producer and distributor of legwear in Mexico and one of the top five world-wide.
