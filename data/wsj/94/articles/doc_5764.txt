A county jury in Detroit awarded a minority-owned accounting firm $1.3 million plus interest in a suit the firm brought against Coopers & Lybrand, charging breach of contract.
The minority-owned firm, Barrow, Aldridge & Co., filed suit against Coopers & Lybrand in Wayne County Circuit Court in June 1992, charging that the big accounting firm violated a 1977 exclusive joint-venture agreement for the two firms to share government contracts.
From the 1970s to the late 1980s, state and federal law mandated that bigger firms needed minority participation to obtain government contracts.
Attorneys for the minority firm argued that Coopers & Lybrand secretly started sharing government work with a different minority firm in 1986, after Tom Barrow, president and a shareholder of Barrow, Aldridge, made an unsuccessful bid to become mayor of Detroit.
A spokesman for Coopers & Lybrand said it was "very surprised" at the jury's verdict, and that the firm would appeal.
