Italian computer maker Ing.
C. Olivetti & C. SpA said its board resolved to submit to an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders a proposal to allow the company to raise up to one trillion lire ($585 million) "in one or more operations" over a five-year period.
At the same time, the board will submit to shareholders a proposal to issue bonds, if needed, for up to the same amount for the same time period.
"The information technology industry is currently undergoing sweeping changes which will lead to a new period of market growth.
Companies today must therefore be able to respond very rapidly as regards both changes in their offers and investments," Olivetti Chairman Carlo De Benedetti said.
"This applies in particular to multimedia, an important new market where innovative computer and telecommunications technologies converge, which affects each of the sectors in which we operate.
Olivetti intends to extend its European leadership to this field, too," he said.
Olivetti also announced that the company's sales in 1993 reached 8.610 trillion lire, up from 8.025 trillion lire in 1992.
No earnings figures were released.
Mr. De Benedetti said the gain in sales, "after two years of zero growth . . . reflects the market's appreciation of Olivetti's new product line and is an indication of the vitality with which the group operates."
