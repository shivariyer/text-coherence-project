Newmont Gold Co. said its public shareholders approved the combination of its assets with those of its majority owner, Newmont Mining Corp.
The gold-mining companies said 94% of Newmont Gold's shares were voted in favor of the combination and 81% were voted in favor of a new preferred stock.
Newmont Mining, which owned 90.1% of Newmont Gold's shares, had agreed to vote its shares in the same proportions as the votes cast by Newmont Gold's public shareholders.
The plan, which didn't require the approval of Newmont Mining's shareholders, leaves Newmont Mining with 89.2% of Newmont Gold's common stock and 100% of its new preferred stock.
Until now, Newmont Gold's assets were mainly in Nevada, while Newmont Mining held properties in foreign countries.
The companies already had essentially the same management.
The companies stopped short of merging completely to avoid a $379 million goodwill charge against earnings.
As part of the combination, Newmont Mining is to declare today a 1.2481-to-1 stock split, so that the number of Newmont Mining shares outstanding will equal the number of Newmont Gold shares owned by Newmont Mining.
The companies said their common stocks will continue to be traded separately on the New York Stock Exchange.
But because the companies will report the same per-share assets, operating results, earnings and dividends, their stocks are expected to trade at substantially the same price.
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Newmont Gold shares closed at $45, up $1.25, while Newmont Mining closed at $54.50, up $1.25.
