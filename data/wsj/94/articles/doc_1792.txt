Cie. des Machines Bull said its 1993 net loss after provisions widened to 5.07 billion francs ($878.7 million) from 4.72 billion francs in 1992.
The French state-controlled computer maker said its 1993 accounts included restructuring provisions of 1.65 billion francs "to support the group turnaround."
Bull's revenue in 1993 totaled 28.25 billion francs, down 6.4% from 30.19 billion francs in 1992.
The group also posted an operating loss of 1.89 billion francs, while debt at the end of December stood at 4.45 billion francs.
Bull said it was taking the restructuring provision in its 1993 accounts to reduce costs and reorganize company sites worldwide, as well as create a reserve to provide for additional measures "which may have to be taken in relation to market evolution and future group results."
The latest earnings report brings Bull's accumulated losses since 1989 to 20 billion francs.
In a surprise move last week, the French government authorized the privatization of Bull, which is likely to take place in 1994.
Rather than a public offering, officials have indicated that they will search for industrial partners to take shareholdings in Bull.
Japan's NEC Corp., which holds a 4.43% stake, was courted by French Industry Minister Gerard Longuet last week in an effort to persuade it to boost its holding.
