CMS Energy Corp.'s Consumers Power Co. unit said it accepted the resignation of a top nuclear-power executive and planned to reassign a nuclear manager to another post because of poor performance at its Palisades nuclear power plant in South Haven, Mich.
The move follows a recent visit by Ivan Selin, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman, who was very critical of Palisades' performance.
The NRC fined Consumers Power twice over the past six months because of refueling problems and improper thermal settings.
"He had very harsh words for the plant," a spokesman for Jackson, Mich.-based Consumers Power said.
"The NRC wasn't happy with the plant and neither were we."
David Hoffman, 49 years old, vice president for Consumer Powers nuclear operations since 1988, resigned earlier this week.
"It was a mutual decision directly related to Palisades' performance," the Consumers Power spokesman said.
Gerald Slade, 50 years old, had served as Palisades general manager for the past five years.
His new assignment hasn't been determined.
Tom Palmisano, 43, Palisades operations manager, has been named acting manager.
