Germany's Daimler-Benz AG said Chairman Edzard Reuter will stay at the helm of the group until the end of 1995, dismissing press reports that he could leave in early 1995 or earlier.
"Speculation and rumors from others are groundless, as Daimler-Benz AG on Monday, Feb. 28, 1994, says," the statement said.
The Financial Times, citing aerospace industry sources, reported Mr. Reuter will likely become supervisory board chairman of Airbus Industrie, in which Daimler owns a 37.8% stake.
