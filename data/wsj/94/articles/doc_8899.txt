The ruble fell 3.4% to a record low against the dollar in Moscow after Sunday's resignation of First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, architect of Russia's economic reforms.
Mr. Gaidar's announcement aggravated worries on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange that foes of economic-stabilization policies were gaining the upper hand in the government.
The dollar was fixed at 1,402 rubles Monday, up from Friday's 1,356 rubles, the previous record.
Monday opened with a $28 million imbalance between demand for the dollar and supply.
The huge volume of buy orders drove the rate higher, traders said.
Participants said central-bank intervention appeared modest.
Alexander Afonin, chief dealer at Credo Bank, said the flurry of dollar demand seen Monday isn't likely to be repeated in the coming days, though buying will likely remain heavy.
But he predicted that if the government doesn't provide some clear sign that current financial-stabilization policies will continue, the ruble will decline further.
