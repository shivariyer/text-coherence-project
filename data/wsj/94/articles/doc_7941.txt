FoxMeyer Corp. said its promotion of generic pharmaceuticals and private-label products in independent pharmacies helped improve results for the fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31.
The Dallas wholesale drug distributor, jarred by the August 1992 bankruptcy-law filing of its largest customer, Phar-Mor Inc., reported net income of $8.4 million, or 30 cents a share, on sales of $1.3 billion.
For the 1992 period, FoxMeyer had a loss of $17.7 million, or 61 cents a share, on sales of $1.2 billion.
The year-ago third quarter included a charge of $42.8 million to cover unpaid Phar-Mor bills.
For the first nine months of the fiscal year, FoxMeyer said net income totaled $16.8 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with a loss of $5.3 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier.
Independent pharmacies in FoxMeyer's "Health Mart" program, which offers advertising and marketing, ordered a broader package of services during the quarter, making the program more profitable, a spokesman said.
