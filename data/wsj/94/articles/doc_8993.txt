This is the first exhibit in more than a century to focus on the French painter's landscapes.
Among the more than 75 pastels, prints and drawings are two of his earliest landscapes, "Italian Landscape Seen Through an Arch" (1856) and "View of Mt. Vesuvius" (circa 1856).
In the fall of 1869, during a visit to the Normandy coast, Degas completed more than 40 pastels.
Included from this period are his "Beside the Sea," "Beach at Low Tide" and "Seascape at Sunset."
