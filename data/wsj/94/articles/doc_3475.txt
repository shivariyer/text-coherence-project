The Senate, by a 58-38 vote, confirmed Stanford University law professor William Gould IV as chairman of the National Labor Relations Board.
The Senate then confirmed by voice vote two other board members, Philadelphia lawyer Margaret Browning and Washington lawyer Charles Cohen, as well as House staffer Frederick Feinstein as the labor board's general counsel.
The three new members give the Clinton administration a majority on the board, which is the arbiter of disputes between unions and companies and which helps determine ground rules in such areas as the legality of worker-management teams.
Five Republicans joined 53 Democrats in backing Mr. Gould, who has had an extensive career as a union lawyer, management lawyer and arbitrator.
The vote ends one of the most contentious nominations in the Clinton administration's 13-month tenure.
Republicans blocked the nomination for months based on Mr. Gould's writings, which backed such pro-labor aims as easier union organizing.
But Mr. Gould vowed at his confirmation hearing that he wouldn't lean in favor of unions or management as chairman.
