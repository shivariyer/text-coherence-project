Medex Inc., Hilliard, Ohio, said its Medex Medical Inc. unit signed an exclusive packaging and distribution agreement with Cordis Europa N.V., the Brussels-based unit of Cordis Corp., Miami.
The maker and distributor of disposable medical products for critical and acute care estimates that the agreement, which became effective Jan. 1, may result in sales of as much as $30 million over the three-year term of the pact.
Medex said the agreement is part of its strategic plan to form alliances with other leading medical-products companies.
Under terms, Medex Medical will provide custom procedure kits for cardiological and radiological diagnostic procedures, which Cordis Europa will market and distribute in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
The company said the kits will contain products manufactured by Medex and Cordis as well as other companies.
Cordis Europa operates production facilities in the Netherlands and southern France that make angiographic and neuroscience products.
Its parent is a manufacturer and marketer of medical devices.
