Housewares retailer Lechters Inc. named Steen Kanter, president of East Coast operations for Swedish home-furnishing retailer Ikea AB, to be vice chairman and chief executive officer.
Lechters, which operates 572 stores in 42 states, also promoted Michael A. Anthony to president and chief operating officer.
As chief executive, Mr. Kanter, 47 years old, succeeds Lechters co-founder Donald Jonas, 64, who remains chairman.
The vice chairman position had been vacant since November when co-founder Albert Lechter, 64, resigned.
Mr. Lechter remains a consultant and director.
Mr. Kanter was a 22-year veteran of Ikea.
A spokeswoman for Ikea said the company hasn't named a successor.
Mr. Anthony, 38, had been an executive vice president.
The president and chief operating officer positions were left vacant by Mr. Lechter in 1992 when he became vice chairman.
