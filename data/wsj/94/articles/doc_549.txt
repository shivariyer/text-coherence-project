Geneva Steel Co., citing a special charge and production inefficiencies, said it expects to post a net loss of $14 million to $15 million for its fiscal second quarter ending Thursday .
In the year-earlier period, the Vineyard, Utah, company had a loss of $4.6 million, or 32 cents a share, on sales of $115.5 million.
The steelmaker said the latest quarter includes an extraordinary charge of $10 million, mainly from a prepayment premium related to a recent senior-note offering of $190 million.
The company expects an operating loss as a result of production inefficiencies from construction of modernization projects, including a continuous caster, which makes steel slabs from liquid steel.
Geneva also cited higher iron-making costs because of reconditioning work at its blast furnace.
"Although earnings in the short term are being negatively affected, we expect the continuous caster and other modernization projects to significantly increase throughput, reduce costs and improve quality as they are brought on line," the company said.
