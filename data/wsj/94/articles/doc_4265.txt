Just as he is trying to raise large sums for what he hopes will be a big winner, Philadelphia entrepreneur Ed Snider appears to have a conspicuous loser on his hands.
SpectAthlete Partnership, the operator and franchiser of 66 sports apparel stores under the names Showcase and Complete Athlete, filed for protection from creditors last week under the federal Bankruptcy Code.
SpectAthlete is 85%-owned by a unit of Spectacor Inc., a family-owned sports, entertainment and communications company controlled by Mr. Snider.
A court hearing on SpectAthlete's bankruptcy filing occurs today.
An aggressive dealmaker, the 62-year-old Mr. Snider controls the Philadelphia Flyers professional hockey team, the Spectrum arena there and other ventures.
The crisis at SpectAthlete -- a rare blemish on his record -- comes as he seeks to raise about $135 million from private investors to help finance Spectrum 2, a major arena intended to open in Philadelphia by the fall of 1996.
Mr. Snider couldn't be reached for comment.
But Philip Weinberg, Spectacor's corporate counsel, says that Mr. Snider doesn't have any personal financial problems, and that SpectAthlete's difficulties won't affect Mr. Snider's other businesses or his ability to finance the planned arena.
But many SpectAthlete franchisees worry about their future.
Milton Schneider, a partner in a Complete Athlete franchise in New York, blames Mr. Snider for failing to turn SpectAthlete around.
"Here's a guy who, if he can build an arena, surely could have bailed out the company, or at least identified the problems and tried to solve them," Mr. Schneider maintains.
"But he stayed hands-off on the whole situation."
Nonsense, says Jack L. Williams, president of Spectacor.
He says Mr. Snider has poured money into SpectAthlete year after year.
"If it hadn't been for Mr. Snider, the company would have been out of business five years ago."
Initially only a 50% partner in SpectAthlete, Mr. Snider left its management to others until this month, Spectacor says.
SpectAthlete declines to discuss its disgruntled franchisees or to provide names of satisfied ones.
Until recently, many franchisees held a very high opinion of Mr. Snider.
Indeed, some say that SpectAthlete franchise marketers relied on his reputation for business savvy.
"The sales pitch was: Ed Snider's a winner," says Peter Arest, who owns Complete Athlete stores in White Plains, N.Y., and Rockaway Township, N.J.
Unlike most franchisers, SpectAthlete -- which operates in 10 states, mostly in the Northeast -- distributed goods to franchisees.
When fierce competition depressed sales in the past two years, many franchisees fell behind in paying the company, Spectacor says.
SpectAthlete then fell behind with its suppliers.
Last May, SpectAthlete told franchisees that they would need more credit and cash to get additional supplies, franchisees say.
Ronald E. Scheer, whose Green Monster Sports Inc. in Syracuse, N.Y., operates four Complete Athlete franchises in the Northeast, says he stopped paying royalties last year because otherwise he couldn't afford to meet the new credit requirements.
He and the company are now embroiled in a legal dispute over royalties and other matters in a state court in Syracuse.
Mr. Schneider says his store was profitable last year only because it rejected SpectAthlete's distribution system and opened its own accounts with suppliers.
He and SpectAthlete also are now legal adversaries -- in an arbitration proceeding in Philadelphia and a federal court case in New York.
SpectAthlete's problems grew into a full-fledged crisis earlier this year.
SpectAthlete unsuccessfully sought a moratorium on paying its overdue bills while offering to pay cash for new goods, Spectacor says.
Creditors refused.
Then they stunned the company with a legal assault.
On Feb. 2, the same day that Mr. Snider and others staged a news conference about the proposed arena, three creditors sought to force SpectAthlete into involuntary bankruptcy.
Last week, the company responded with a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, seeking to keep its operations running while working out a plan to settle its debts.
Today's planned court hearing mostly seeks to explore SpectAthlete's plan to keep afloat by borrowing a further $2.5 million from Continental Bank, a Philadelphia unit of Midlantic Corp.
SpectAthlete already owes the bank $5.3 million, according to a court filing by the company.
Spectacor says Mr. Snider has signed a guarantee that, if necessary, he will repay any additional SpectAthlete debt.
While declining to disclose specific figures, SpectAthlete confirms that it spilled red ink in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31.
But it insists that its operations haven't been impaired by those losses, creditors' moves or anything else.
"The stores are fine for now," says William Boos, who became SpectAthlete's president last month.
"There has been no interruption of product flow, and there will be none."
But some angry franchisees say their stores are far from fine, lacking most of the spring merchandise that they should have by now.
They blame Mr. Snider for letting SpectAthlete alienate important suppliers.
These franchisees also complain that SpectAthlete reduced its exposure in the last 18 months by selling about a dozen franchiser-owned units to new franchisees.
Now, Mr. Snider may be thinking about selling the whole troubled company.
Rentrak Corp., a diversified videotape distributor in Portland, Ore., says it is talking with Spectacor about possibly acquiring SpectAthlete.
Rentrak says its Pro Image Inc. unit already oversees 200 sportsapparel shops, mostly franchises.
Under Rentrak, SpectAthlete would gain the "critical mass" that it lacks, says Ron A. Berger, Rentrak chairman.
With too few units, he explains, a chain can't support a franchiser's overhead.
Spectacor's Mr. Weinberg confirms the talks about SpectAthlete.
He adds, "Our aim is to find an appropriate solution for the company's difficulties."
