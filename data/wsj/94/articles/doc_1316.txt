California Federal Bank said it raised about $195 million through a rights offering, which ended March 16.
The thrift now has 46.6 million shares outstanding, up from 25 million previously.
The thrift has previously said that the offering is part of its strategy to "hold and fix" itself instead of selling itself to another bank.
Last month, CalFed rejected an acquisition bid of $630 million by crossstate rival Golden West Financial Corp., Oakland, Calif.
