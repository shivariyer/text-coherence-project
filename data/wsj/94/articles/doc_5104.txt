The Army selected a new missile interceptor being developed by Loral Corp. over a system being developed by Raytheon Co.
The Army chose Loral's extended-range interceptor missile, known as the Erint, over Raytheon's multimode missile.
Raytheon builds the Patriot missile intercept system that became famous during the Persian Gulf War.
Compared with the Patriot, "the Erint missile offers increased range, accuracy and lethality," a Pentagon statement said.
The Pentagon said that as a hedge, a reduced amount of funding would go toward continuing the development of the multimode missile.
No contract was actually awarded by the Pentagon, and no dollar amount was specified in the statement.
The Army decision, following a closely watched competition in the defense industry, still must be affirmed by the Pentagon's defense acquisition board at a session scheduled for March 1.
If the board agrees, the Erint missile, built by New York-based Loral's Vought Systems unit, could be funded for further development and eventually funded for valuable contracts for production and delivery near the end of the decade, provided Congress goes along.
A spokesman for Loral confirmed the selection but had no further comment.
At Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., a spokesman said managers are "deeply disappointed" because they felt their multimode missile had performed well in tests and presented the lowest risk to the Army.
He said Raytheon will ask for a full briefing on the decision.
