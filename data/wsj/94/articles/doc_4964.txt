CDI Corp., riding the "outsourcing" trend among major companies, expects to report improved earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter and all of 1993.
As the economy gets stronger, outsourcing is gaining, Chief Financial Officer Edgar D. Landis said in an interview.
The Philadelphia temporary-personnel services company markets itself as an outsourcing service for technical needs, Mr. Landis said.
He described outsourcing as the decision by companies to seek permanent help from outside companies for peripheral, noncore activities.
Last year's results should continue a strong turnaround for CDI, which, like some other temporary staff companies hit by the recession, had declining revenue in 1991 and reported a loss for the year.
Mr. Landis said he's comfortable with analysts' earnings estimates of about 12 cents a share for the recent fourth quarter, compared with four cents a year earlier, and 40 cents for all of 1993, compared with 17 cents in 1992.
Mr. Landis also said he's comfortable with Zacks Investment Research's mean earnings estimate of about 67 cents for 1994, based on a survey of three analysts.
According to Landis, CDI will report fourth-quarter revenue of $238 million, 9% above the prior year's $218.3 million.
For the year, revenue should have risen 8% to $921 million from 1992's $855 million.
The company said revenue in its largest division, technical services, rose 15% to $776 million for 1993.
Mr. Landis said the fourth quarter showed continued improvement in backlog of new business in the automotive segment of technical services.
He sees this trend continuing in 1994.
