Adam Opel AG, the German unit of General Motors Corp. of the U.S., said it was "impossible to avoid a clear loss" in 1993.
The Frankfurt company wasn't more specific but said it was confident it would return to profitability in 1994.
In 1992, Opel reported a profit of 202 million marks ($115.7 million).
Opel said sales fell 24% to more than 22 billion marks from 29.2 billion marks a year earlier.
It didn't provide a more precise figure for 1993.
While GM-Europe remained profitable in 1993, Opel said several factors pushed the unit into the red.
These were 160 million marks to fund shortened shifts and 350 million marks for early retirement and severance pay, as well as 380 million marks in losses from exchange-rate fluctuations.
Opel reported output slid 24% to 1.074 million units in 1993 from 1.411 million units a year earlier.
