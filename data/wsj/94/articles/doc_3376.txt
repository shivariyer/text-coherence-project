Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc. said February sales fell 4% to $51 million from $53 million a year earlier, while sales at stores open at least a year fell 23%.
The specialty clothing retailer, which is based in Joppa, Md., filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in January.
It said the disappointing sales reflected continued low inventory levels as well as frequent winter storms.
"Inventory levels have improved slowly" since the Chapter 11 filing, it said.
"Same-store sales will continue to show significant declines while inventory remains below planned levels."
Merry-Go-Round said it is optimistic about the improving relationships with vendors and factors, who provide funds secured by accounts receivable, "but it will take a few months for the inventory levels to rebound."
