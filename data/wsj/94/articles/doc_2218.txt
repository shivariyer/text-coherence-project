A unit of McKesson Corp. will supply Drug Emporium Inc. with pharmaceuticals and other products, in a five-year contract expected to be valued at about $1 billion to McKesson.
McKesson Drug Co. will initially supply 77 Drug Emporium stores and several of its franchise stores with drugs, over-the-counter medicines, health and beauty-care items.
The companies will work together to integrate computer systems to improve product ordering and inventory management.
Drug Emporium, based in Columbus, Ohio, has 133 company-owned stores and 102 franchise stores.
The company will become McKesson's fifth-largest customer, a McKesson spokesman said.
Separately, McKesson, based in San Francisco, said it completed the sale of $180 million in subordinated debentures convertible into shares of approximately 6,940,000 shares of Armor All Products Corp. stock owned by McKesson.
