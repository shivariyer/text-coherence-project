I'm surprised that The Wall Street Journal would go on a wild grouse hunt in its recent story about how Kay Bailey Hutchison's troubles at the Texas Treasury began.
You reported that when Hutchison defeated Bob Krueger, "Democrats started grousing that Ms. Hutchison had misused her position as treasurer to advance her political activities."
You got the grousers mixed up.
They came from Hutchison's own Republican fold.
The original grouser was on her staff, the daughter of former Gov. John Connally.
She accused Ms. Hutchison of ordering her to perform personal chores on state time.
Then two more grousers entered the field: Jack Fields and Joe Barton, Hutchison's Republican opponents for the Senate, who used the allegations in their campaigns against her.
The Democrats got into the wild grouse hunt after the first shots had been fired.
