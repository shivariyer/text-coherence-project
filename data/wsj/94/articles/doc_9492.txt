The next-to-last holdout in Japan's personal-computer wars has thrown in the towel.
Seiko Epson Corp., the only company to clone PCs made by Japanese market leader NEC Corp., on Tuesday said it will immediately start selling PCs compatible with those made by International Business Machines Corp.
Until now, Seiko Epson had been the only Japanese PC maker except NEC that had refused to sell IBM-compatible PCs in Japan.
Seiko Epson's move underscores the threat NEC's computers face from IBM-compatible machines.
More than a year ago, U.S. manufacturers IBM, Compaq Computer Corp. and Dell Computer Corp. unleashed a barrage of low-priced, IBM-compatible PCs in Japan.
