VF Corp., Wyomissing, Pa., said fourth-quarter earnings fell 13%, partly reflecting poor performance in its highpriced jeans line.
VF estimated first-quarter earnings would be flat or down slightly.
The apparel company reported quarterly earnings of $61.1 million, or 94 cents a share, down from $70.6 million, or $1.18 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 6.7% to $1.1 billion from $1.03 billion.
The earnings reflected a 16 cent-a-share provision for write-downs and reserves at Girbaud, its line of pricey jeans.
Last year's fourth quarter included a 17 cent-a-share nonrecurring gain.
VF shares declined $1 to $45.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Lawrence Pugh, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the results to continuing problems with "reduced fleecewear volume, manufacturing inefficiencies at Vanity Fair, and poor results at Girbaud."
