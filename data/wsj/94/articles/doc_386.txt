Comverse Technology Inc., Woodbury, N.Y., said 1993 earnings more than doubled, but its stock slid 35% after the company said it expects 1994 operating results to decline from 1993 levels.
The maker of computer and telecommunications systems reported net income of $12.7 million, or 65 cents a share, up from $5.7 million, or 37 cents a share, in 1992.
Revenue jumped 83.3% to $70.4 million from $38.4 million.
Comverse didn't report separate fourth-quarter results.
The company's shares tumbled $4.875 to close at $9.125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Comverse said significant increases in planned investment in operations and a lag in large government-systems-division orders, are likely to cause this year's operating profit to decline.
The company said investment increases in its operations will hurt 1994 operating results, but is meant to position the company for "long-term leadership in its targeted markets."
Comverse said the markets it targets with its two major product lines are expected to have strong growth in the forseeable future.
