H. Wayne Huizenga, chairman and chief executive officer of Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., realized $15 million during 1993 by exercising options to acquire the company's stock.
The options exercised came on top of the 56-year-old executive's salary and bonus of $556,731 for 1993, which was up about 7% from $521,154 the previous year, according to a preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Huizenga, whose holdings include interests in three major-league sports teams, generally receives a salary at the "low end" of the range paid to executives with similar experience and qualifications, the company said in its proxy.
Stock options, the company said, are the predominate portion of Blockbuster's executive pay packages.
During 1993, Mr. Huizenga received options to buy 385,715 shares.
He exercised 591,141 options that year, with a value realized of $15 million.
Blockbuster, a video and music retailer, reported net income of $243.6 million, or $1.10 a share, in 1993, up from $148.2 million, or 76 cents a share, the previous year.
The company earlier this year announced that it would merge with Viacom Inc.
