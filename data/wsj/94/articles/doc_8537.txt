Canada's merchandise trade surplus narrowed to 736 million Canadian dollars (US$560.2 million) in November from C$1.62 billion in October, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
The decline in the surplus was attributed partly to a drop in auto exports to the U.S. in November as a result of temporary plant shutdowns.
