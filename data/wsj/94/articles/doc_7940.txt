Standard Register Co., citing steady sales growth and continued operational cost-cutting, said it expects fourth-quarter net income to rise to about 46 cents a share from 43 cents a year earlier.
Standard's president and chief executive officer, John Darragh, indicated that the quarter's results would "beat" the 1992 quarter's net of $12.5 million on revenue of $193.4 million.
For the year, Mr. Darragh said he didn't "take exception" to analysts' earnings estimates of about $1.46 a share, compared with 90 cents in 1992, which included a one-time accounting charge of 47 cents.
Net income for the Dayton, Ohio, data form concern rose to about $42 million in 1993 on revenue of about $730 million, from $26 million on revenue of $705.2 million in 1992, Mr. Darragh said.
Mr. Darragh said he expected 1994 net to be 5% to 7% ahead of 1993's.
Contributing to the growth will be continued restructuring of operational processing and procedures -- a streamlining designed to avert significant layoffs.
