Digicon Inc. said it will issue stock and provide capital for part ownership of three new companies that will provide geophysical services in the former Soviet Union.
The value of the transaction is about $16 million.
Digicon said it plans to issue between 5.1 million and 5.4 million shares of common stock to MD Seis, a geophysical and petroleum consulting firm with offices in Houston and Moscow.
MD Seis, in turn, will create three new companies, DG Seis Overseas Ltd., Seismic Technology Inc. and MD Seis Geophysical Co. (Russia), which will record and process data used to locate oil reserves.
Digicon said it will own 50% of the companies, and it will also provide up to $3 million in working capital.
