Ashland Coal Inc. and Arch Mineral Corp. broke off talks concerning a possible merger that would have produced the nation's fifth-largest coal producer.
A spokeswoman for Ashland Coal said "the two parties could not agree on a valuation."
She declined to give details concerning the breakdown.
A spokesman for St. Louis-based Arch Mineral declined to comment.
Ashland Oil Inc. of Ashland, Ky., which owns a 38% stake in Ashland Coal and a 50% stake in Arch Mineral, said it was "very disappointed that negotiations were unsuccessful."
