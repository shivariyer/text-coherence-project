Delta Air Lines signed a preliminary agreement with Austrian Airlines to form a marketing link on the New York-Vienna route starting this summer.
The two airlines plan a code-sharing deal that will allow both airlines to designate their own flight numbers to the same flight.
Austrian Airlines, which flies daily between New York and Vienna, will continue to use its aircraft, with Delta buying a portion of the capacity.
Delta previously announced it intends to stop flying the route directly.
Both the Austrian and U.S. governments must approve the deal.
The agreement is the latest in a series of marketing arrangements signed by both carriers.
Delta is actively seeking partnerships to help it slash its transAtlantic capacity by 12% and stem losses on those routes.
The Atlanta-based airline already has similar marketing links with Belgium's Sabena and Hungary's Malev airlines.
Since spending more than $500 million in 1991 for Pan Am's extensive European route network, Delta has struggled to make a profit from its investment.
Separately, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines is in talks with LOT Polish Airlines on a code-sharing arrangement, which would allow LOT to fly to the U.S. and gain access to American's extensive route network and let American funnel passengers to Eastern Europe.
An American spokesman wouldn't comment on talks with LOT, saying only that "we talk to a lot of people about a lot of things all the time."
