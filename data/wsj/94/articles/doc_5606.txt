Jack Falvey, in his Jan. 10 Manager's Journal, confuses the misuse of a tool with problems in the tool.
There is no question that any sales manager worth his salt needs to take time out to visit clients, prospects and sales offices with his sales people.
If you never see salespeople in action, it's very difficult to help them close a sale.
However, it is also useful to provide those salespeople with tools that help; things like cellular phones, office resources and, yes, software that helps automate the selling process.
While Mr. Falvey may know wonderful salespeople who keep more than 500 prospect names, addresses and interests in their heads, the rest of us need some assistance.
Providing information at their fingertips that allows salespeople to remember not only the last sale, but also the prospect's spouse's name, interest in sports or something else, and perhaps the best time to contact the client.
Such things can greatly improve the productivity of the sales force.
And what happens if the salesperson is out of the office?
With automation, all the information about the client is available to anyone who needs it.
When a salesperson leaves, automation provides for continuity.
In addition, with automation, sales management can spot trends, both good and bad, much more quickly and precisely.
The fact that these computer systems are often misused both by sales people and by sales managers is not a defect in the systems, but rather a clear indication of lack of training on and understanding of these systems.
