The board of Westland PLC said yesterday that it has advised shareholders to reject the "unwelcome" bid made Tuesday by GKN PLC.
Westland in London, said the offer fails to value properly Westland's prospects and could deprive its shareholders of the full benefits arising from any settlement in a dispute stemming from a collapsed 1978 Westland joint-venture agreement with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, to develop helicopters in Egypt.
On Tuesday, GKN announced its intention to buy the shares of Westland that it doesn't already own for #366 million ($536.9 million).
