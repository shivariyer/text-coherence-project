Microsoft Corp. said it agreed with Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Tele-Communications Inc. to test the use of cable television systems to deliver energy-information services to homes.
Under the agreement, consumers participating in the test would be supplied with two-way communications trade information with Pacific Gas & Electric using television sets hooked into TCI's cable-TV system.
Microsoft, Redmond, Wash., said it will write the operating-system software used in the service.
TCI is based in Englewood, Colo.
The companies will test the service in about 2,000 homes in Walnut Creek, Calif., and other places in the state this year.
Consumers using the service could, for instance, use it to get an up-to-the-minute look at how much gas and electricity they are using and what it is costing them, Pacific Gas & Electric said in a news release.
Customers could also pay energy bills through the system, and the utility could use the network to quickly pinpoint power outages.
The test comes as many industries are looking for services that might take advantage of an "information superhighway."
Utilities have been particularly interested in the potential of cable and phone lines to allow them to do such tasks reading customers' electric and gas meters from afar.
