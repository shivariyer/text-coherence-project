French satellite television group Canal Plus SA and Germany's Bertelsmann AG confirmed a much-rumored linkup in pay television and new TV services, in the latest development in Europe's multimedia industry.
Canal Plus said it signed an agreement that will set the timetable and basic terms for projects in pay TV and new services made possible through digital technology, such as pay-per-view TV and video on demand.
A new company will be created by summer, it said.
Canal Plus didn't disclose any financial details.
Officials couldn't be reached for a comment.
