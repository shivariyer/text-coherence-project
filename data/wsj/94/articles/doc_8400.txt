Pope & Talbot Inc. reported a 61% jump in fourth-quarter net income and a return to profitability for 1993, and Chairman Peter Pope said improvements in pulp and paper segments should drive earnings higher this year.
The Portland, Ore., forest-products concern posted fourth-quarter earnings of $4.6 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net of $2.8 million, or 25 cents a share.
Sales rose 11%, to $159.2 million from $143.9 million.
For the year, the company had net income of $21 million, or $1.80 a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $2.3 million, or 19 cents a share.
Sales were $628.9 million, up 16% from a year-earlier $544.3 million.
Mr. Pope cited strength in the lumber and disposable-diaper businesses, which he said should continue, and he predicted better results in the still-weak tissue and pulp segments.
