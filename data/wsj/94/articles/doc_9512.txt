Is Southwest Airlines' CEO Herb Kelleher going Hollywood?
The colorful Mr. Kelleher makes his prime-time debut next month on the NBC sitcom, "Wings" -- a show that centers around the founders of a startup commuter airline.
Mr. Kelleher was scheduled to tape the show last night.
Mr. Kelleher met the "Wings" cast last fall during a charity bowling tournament to raise money for Angel Flight, which provides free air transportation for patients in need of medical care.
Although Southwest Airlines' team lost the tournament ("I think they cheated," says Mr. Kelleher), its boss landed a walk-on part on the program.
But don't think this is a case of art imitating life.
True, the program is about a commuter airline.
And yes, it's scheduled to appear on Valentine's Day (the heart is a favored symbol of Southwest, which is based out of Love Field in Dallas.)
But if you doubt that there's a major difference between "Wings" and real life, consider this: The always-talkative Mr. Kelleher isn't scheduled for a speaking part.
"Wings" spokesman Patty Triplett says Mr. Kelleher likely will be in the background, milling about in the passenger-waiting area.
Ms. Triplett, however, says there is a slight chance that the show's writers will come up with a line or two to give Mr. Kelleher.
"I have a feeling he's going to try to weasel his way in," Ms. Triplett says.
