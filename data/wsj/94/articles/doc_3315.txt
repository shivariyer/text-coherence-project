The fares are for domestic flights, as well as trips to Canada and to three cities in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Jamaica.

Other major airlines are expected to follow suit.
Under the sale, round-trip fare between New York and Los Angeles falls to $358 from $643.
A Memphis-to-Seattle flight drops to $318 from $590.
This week, carriers led by America West Airlines slashed coast-to-coast and other long-haul fares by as much as 52% on advance-purchase tickets.
Under America West's sale, travel is good through June 15.
