Los Angeles attorney Lynn Boyd Stites, mastermind of a massive fraud and legal-corruption scheme that bilked insurance firms of tens of millions of dollars, was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison.
A federal district court judge here also ordered him to forfeit $50 million.
Prosecutors described Mr. Stites as the central player in a secret network of almost two dozen lawyers and law firm employees dubbed "The Alliance," which defrauded insurers by resisting settlements, prolonging litigation, inventing new legal controversies and even representing both sides of the same lawsuit.
The ring bled between $50 million and $200 million from insurance company clients.
Last October, Mr. Stites was convicted of racketeering and mail-fraud charges.
Eighteen other individuals previously were convicted of participating in the scheme.
