Mattel Inc. posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $42.7 million, or 26 cents a share, after taking $105.1 million in charges related to its $1.1 billion acquisition of Fisher-Price Inc., but had record operating earnings for the period.
The charges included $90.4 million in restructuring costs and $14.7 million for Mattel's early prepayment of $100 million of high-interest debt that it assumed in last year's acquisition of Fisher-Price.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Mattel shares surged $1.75, or 7.5%, to close at $25.
In the year-earlier fourth quarter, consolidated net income of the toy companies was $49.6 million, or 28 cents a share.
Per-share results reflect the addition of shares issued in the Fisher-Price transaction, and a subsequent 5-for-4 stock split in January.
Sales in the quarter rose 3.7% to $753.9 million from $727 million, while profit before the extraordinary charges increased 26% to $62.4 million.
