Nova Industrial Holdings Ltd. of Hong Kong, a leading importer of wool into China, was acquired by a tiny Colorado software concern for stock valued at $62.4 million.
Though Generation 5 Technology Inc. is technically the acquiring company, it is being swallowed up by the much-larger Nova, which will account for most of the operations of the combined company.
In addition to importing wool into China, Nova exports industrial chemicals and other goods from China to elsewhere in Asia and to Africa, said Charles Hawley, chief executive officer of Westminster-based Generation 5.
He said Nova also plans to start making mopeds in China, for sale there.
In 1993, Nova had unaudited earnings of $10.2 million on sales of $137 million, Generation 5 said.
In the third quarter of 1993, Generation 5 posted a loss of $379,900, or 24 cents a share, on revenue of $411,513.
