Cautious comments by influential Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Elaine Garzarelli combined with weak bonds and sell programs to drive stock prices broadly lower.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed near its session low of 3895.34, below the psychologically important 3900 level.
The loss represents a 36.58-point, or 0.93%, slide.
While stocks gyrated all session long, the Dow industrials took an initial 25-point nosedive around noon after Ms. Garzarelli repeated her view on cable-television network CNBC that a 4% to 7% market correction is possible.
A spokeswoman in Ms. Garzarelli's office said the analyst hasn't changed her bullish stance.
She said Ms. Garzarelli has stated that a correction of that size would be "normal" for the market.
A larger correction of 10% or more, the spokeswoman said, wouldn't happen unless the Federal Reserve tightened credit conditions at least once or twice more, in Ms. Garzarelli's view.
Weak bond prices also hurt equities.
The Treasury's long bond fell 1/2 point, pushing its yield up to 6.44%, after the 30-year bond auction.
Broader indexes also fell yesterday.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.84, or 0.81%, to 468.93.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slid 1.86, or 0.71%, to 261.04.
Big Board decliners trampled advancers, 1,311 to 811.

The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 3.11, or 0.40%, to 783.42.
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.46 to 479.13.
Among cyclicals, the Big Three auto makers led the march downward.
General Motors lost 1 3/4 to 62 1/2.
Although it reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.28 a share, analysts said investors were concerned about the failure of GM's earnings to surpass expectations.

Other economically sensitive stocks also fell.
Caterpillar Inc. declined 2 3/4 to 106 1/8, General Electric lost 1 3/4 to 106 1/2, and Philip Morris fell 1 3/8 to 57 3/4.
Merger news carried some stocks higher.

The companies said they have completed their merger.
Columbia Healthcare led the Big Board's most-active list with 9.4 million shares traded, up from average daily volume of 905,800.
In earnings news, Capital Holding slid 2 5/8 to 32 1/2 after the Louisville, Ky., insurer said its fourth-quarter operating net income of 90 cents a share was below earnings of 95 cents expected by analysts.
Kemper Securities Inc. cut its rating on Capital Holding to "hold" from "long-term buy," citing the disappointing results.
British Petroleum American depositary shares dropped 1 1/2 to 66 3/4.
The company said its fourth-quarter replacement-cost-basis profit fell to #54 million ($78.9 million) after a #261 million charge.
A year earlier, British Petroleum had a replacement-cost-basis profit of #193 million.
American depositary receipts of L.M. Ericsson (Nasdaq) fell 2 3/4 to 42 3/8, although the Swedish telecommunications company posted a 1993 pretax profit that more than doubled to 3.1 billion kronor ($386.9 million) from 1.31 billion kronor in 1992.
CML Group, Acton, Mass., added 1 3/4 to 19 1/2 in heavy trading on expectations that its fiscal second-quarter results will exceed original forecasts, analysts said.
Gtech Holdings, a West Greenwich, R.I., on-line lottery networks firm, jumped 3 1/4 to 32 1/4.
The company said its Gtech Administrative Services subsidiary signed a contract, valued at more than $200 million over seven years, with the Texas Department of Human Services to provide a system for the electronic transfer of Food Stamp Program benefits and benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program.
Some traders said that in addition to late sell programs, which brought the Dow industrials broadly lower right before the close, stock prices also might have fallen on a rumor of trading losses at a major Wall Street firm.
Yesterday's session "was indicative of the nervousness out there," said Edward E. Collins III, executive vice president of institutional trading at Daiwa Securities America.
"We had the biggest bull on Wall Street talking about a correction," he said, referring to Ms. Garzarelli.
"The programs exacerbated everything."
Others added that investors are skittish about today's release of January producer prices.
"We're in a very twitchy mood here," said Cummins Catherwood, managing director at Rutherford Brown & Catherwood.
"There's an astounding herd-mentality here, and when they get started, it's hard to turn that herd."
Doug Kass, head of research at JW Charles Securities Inc., said the underlying story yesterday was "the continuing sickly performance of the utility index."
The Dow Jones Utility Average fell 3.56 to 215.40.
"The decline in the utility average tends to presage market declines," Mr. Kass said.
"The deterioration in that average is growing more and more conspicuous and more and more ominous.
It could be the death knell for the market."
