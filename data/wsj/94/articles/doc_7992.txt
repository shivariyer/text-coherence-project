City National Corp. said the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency lifted the order that had required the commercial bank to raise $65 million in capital and to meet other conditions.
After the November 1992 order, City National said, it raised $81 million through a rights offering of common stock and took other steps to improve the company's financial condition.
