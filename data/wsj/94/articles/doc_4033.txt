Westmoreland Coal Co. reported a widened fourth-quarter loss of $92.3 million, resulting partly from one-time charges, and said it "is likely" to sell a major asset because it may run low on cash.
The company also disclosed it was in violation of financial covenants in a number of loans including a revolving loan agreement and a $27 million letter of credit, and is talking to its lenders.
The coal company, based in Philadelphia, said the loss amounted to $13.44 a share.
That compared with a loss of $36.5 million, or $5.43 a share, a year earlier.
Westmoreland said the most-recent results included $79 million in charges for the write off of some mining operations and coal reserves, and provisions for the termination of certain operations and employees.
Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $124.8 million, down 4% from $130.2 million a year earlier.
