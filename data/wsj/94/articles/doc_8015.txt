Reynolds Metals Co., feeling the effects of a world-wide aluminum glut, posted a wider fourth-quarter loss, largely because of charges to cover the costs of previously announced restructuring actions.
The company had a loss of $238.6 million, or $3.98 a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $152.1 million, or $2.55 a share.
The latest period includes restructuring charges of $219.5 million, or $3.67 a share.
The year-earlier period includes charges of $155 million, or $2.60 a share, for environmental and restructuring costs.
Revenue for the quarter, which ended Dec. 31, as well as the year-ago quarter, were $1.35 billion.
The results were slightly better than some analysts had expected.
They were released a day after aluminum-producing nations ended talks in Brussels with a proposal but still no agreement to cut production.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Reynolds Metals stock closed at $50.25 a share, up $2.375, or 5%, in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
For the year, Reynolds posted a loss of $322.1 million, or $5.38 a share, including charges of $8 million, or 13 cents a share, taken in the third quarter to cover the costs of a temporary curtailment of primary capacity, and the $219.5 million, or $3.67 a share, charge taken in the fourth quarter.
That compares with a year-ago loss of $748.8 million, or $12.56 a share, after charges of $793.4 million, or $13.31 a share, principally for the effects of adopting new accounting standards.
Revenue for 1993 totaled $5.29 billion, down 6.4% from $5.66 billion a year ago.
Richard G. Holder, chairman, said the results "reflect a continuation of one of the most difficult periods in the history of the aluminum industry."
He said that despite weakness in several major global economies, "Western world demand for aluminum continued to grow and Reynolds shipments once again showed year-to-year improvement.
The problem is the severity of the world aluminum supply-demand imbalance, which escalated in 1993."
