Lennar Corp., Miami, in partnership with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund L.P., said it agreed to acquire at a discount a portfolio of real-estate assets currently valued at $282 million.
The assets, to be purchased from Lincoln National Life Insurance Co., comprise 46 performing and nonperforming loans and properties.
The loans are secured by properties, including shopping centers, apartments, offices and hotels located throughout the country.
Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
Separately, a Palm Harbor, Fla., couple filed a class-action suit against Lennar, charging the real-estate developer with failing to meet wind-code standards in the construction of about 80 townhomes and other properties.
The suit was filed in state circuit court in St. Petersburg, Fla.
Allan J. Pekor, vice president, finance, said Lennar hadn't yet reviewed the case.
He said the company "takes seriously any issue that affects our homeowners."
In the wake of Hurricane Andrew in Florida, insurers for Lennar paid $2.4 million to settle a dispute with homeowners about construction standards in Lennar homes.
