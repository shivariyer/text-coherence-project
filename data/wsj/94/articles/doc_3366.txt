Automotive supplier Medar Inc. expects sales and earnings for the first quarter of this year to be "better than first quarter 1993," said Chairman and President Charles J. Drake.
"Our backlog is as good as it's ever been," Drake said.
"In the last seven or eight months, our bookings are running the highest they've ever been."
Medar, an automation-equipment maker in Farmington Hills, Mich., earned $615,734, or nine cents a share, on sales of $5.7 million in the year ago first quarter.
"The domestic auto industry has picked up quite a bit," Mr. Drake said.
"And there's going to be a lot of spending in Detroit for the next three years.
There will be dramatic changes in body styles and a lot of changes in models."
In addition to making major body style changes, the auto makers are also expanding truck capacity to meet growing demand for minivans, pickups and sport-utility vehicles, Mr. Drake said.
