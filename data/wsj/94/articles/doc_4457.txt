Industrial group BTR PLC said the planned flotation of its Graham Group building-material unit will generate gross proceeds of #234.2 million ($347.2 million).
The company said it will raise #209.8 million and that the balance of the proceeds represents debt to be repaid or assumed by Graham.
BTR announced plans to float the Graham unit in 1993 but didn't release full financial details.
