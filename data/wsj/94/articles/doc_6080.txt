Scandinavian Airlines System confirmed it is selling its 42% stake in Chilean airline Lan Chile to two other Chilean companies, Inversiones Costa Verde SA and Transnet SA.
An SAS spokesman said the two companies are paying $19 million for the 95 million shares.
The spokesman said SAS paid $30 million for the stake five years ago.
However, SAS is likely to realize a small capital gain on the sale due to the depreciation of the Swedish krona.
