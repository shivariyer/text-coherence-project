Air New Zealand reported that operating profit after tax rose 45% to 88.1 million New Zealand dollars (US$50.6 million) in its fiscal first half ended Dec. 31.
The carrier's operating profit climbed from NZ$60.9 million a year earlier.
Sales rose to NZ$1.27 billion from NZ$1.16 billion.
Air New Zealand said the first-half was characterized by encouraging signs of growth in tourist numbers.
The withdrawal of U.S. carrier Continental Airlines from the New Zealand market last year allowed Air New Zealand to increase its capacity on some routes.
However, it added that the latest growth in earnings was driven almost entirely by growth in passenger traffic.
The favorable effects of low fuel and interest costs and the benefit of taxation offsets also contributed to the profit increase, Air New Zealand said.
The airline added that for the year it is expected to "comfortably exceed" its profit of NZ$139.5 million the previous fiscal year.
The airline said its strong balance sheet and substantial cash reserves mean it has decided to "suspend" its dividend reinvestment plan, which allows shareholders to take bonus shares instead of dividends.
Air New Zealand is 35%-owned by Brierley Investments Ltd., a New Zealand investment and hotel concern, 20% by Qantas Airways of Australia, 5% by Japan Airlines, and 40% by institutional and private investors.
