Japan might replace its finance minister and its chief economic planner if the prime minister succeeds in effecting a proposed cabinet shuffle, a top government official said.
Yukio Hatoyama, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said the seven-month-old administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has nearly completed its first mission, effecting an electoral-reform bill.
Its next step, he said in an interview, could be to put together an "economic-reform cabinet" to tackle such issues as deregulating the economy and resuming growth.
If such a shuffle occurs, Mr. Hatoyama said, Mr. Hosokawa might change his two top economic ministers.
But Mr. Hatoyama added that he isn't sure whether suitable replacements might be found.
The finance portfolio is held by Hirohisa Fujii, and the Economic Planning Agency is headed by Manae Kubota.
Mr. Hatoyama is one of the prime minister's chief representatives.
A change in the key finance ministry slot could be disruptive, coming at a time when Japan is involved in a bitter trade dispute with the U.S.
But replacing the two political leaders who hold the country's top economic portfolios is likely to have little lasting effect on Japanese finance policy.
Regular cabinet shuffles are a feature of Japanese politics, and career bureaucrats have much more control than their politician bosses over the shaping and administration of policy.
Mr. Hosokawa said through another spokesman Tuesday that he would like to carry out his first major cabinet shuffle before he delivers a major forthcoming policy speech.
That speech is scheduled for as early as Friday.
Mr. Hosokawa may not be able to pull off his shake-up right away, however.
The main aim of the change is thought to be the removal of Masayoshi Takemura, Mr. Hosokawa's chief cabinet secretary, who has publicly voiced differences with the prime minister.
Mr. Takemura's allies oppose remaking the cabinet now.
