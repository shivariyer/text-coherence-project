A jury awarded damages of $10.7 million against Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. after finding that asbestos pipe insulation it once manufactured caused cancer in a deceased ship rigger.
The Toledo, Ohio, company is responsible for $4.2 million in compensatory damages and $6.5 million in punitive damages, according to the verdict of a jury in New York Supreme Court.
The jury in the case awarded a total of $12.6 million to the estate of John Scanlon, with other parties responsible for the additional $1.9 million.
Mr. Scanlon, who fitted ships with pipes from 1952 to 1959 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, died in 1993, two years after being diagnosed with mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung, said Richard Nemeroff, one of the estate's attorneys.
An Owens-Corning spokesman said the company will appeal the decision.
Owens-Corning made the asbestos pipe insulation, Kaylo, from 1958 to 1972, he said.
