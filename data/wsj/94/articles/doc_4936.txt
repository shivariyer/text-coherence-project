Media Vision Technology Inc. said fourth-quarter net income rose more than fourfold due to strong sales of the company's semiconductors and multimedia upgrade kits.
Net income for the quarter was $8.5 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with $2 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue nearly tripled to $95 million from $33 million.
Steven J. Allan, Media Vision's chief financial officer, said the increase in profit was driven by a fivefold jump in sales of the company's semiconductor-chip sets and a tripling of sales of multimedia computer upgrade kits.
The areas made up nearly 70% of Media Vision's sales.
For the year, Media Vision, based in Fremont, Calif., had net of $20 million, or $1.40 a share, compared with $1 million, or six cents a share, in 1992.
Revenue rose to $241 million from $69 million.
