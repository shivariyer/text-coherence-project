In a Dec. 27 Marketplace article on an ABC News broadcast of a new allegation about a conspiracy to kill Martin Luther King, I was described as a Hollywood producer who "helped rev the engine" by shopping the theory to "60 Minutes."
This was an unfair characterization.
All I did was ask a former colleague at the CBS newsmagazine to investigate the theory to see whether or not it was true.
If the story had credibility, "60 Minutes" and I might both have a story.
If it didn't, I would have nothing.
Not even Hollywood dares to make a historical film from a nonstory.
The story of Dr. King's murder still contains giant question marks.
I would think any news organization worth its reputation would try to find out what happened to him.
If more reportorial energy were expended in that direction instead of reporting on the behavior of other news organizations and producers such as me, maybe history would be the beneficiary.
