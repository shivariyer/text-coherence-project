Sen. David Durenberger (R., Minn.) was reindicted on charges that he illegally billed the government for living expenses in his own Minnesota home.
An earlier indictment covering the same charges was dismissed in December after U.S. District Judge Warren Urbom found that prosecutors had improperly used privileged Senate records as evidence.
In dismissing the indictment, Judge Urbom criticized the prosecutors as being "overzealous," but he also indicated a new indictment was likely in that "reliance upon the offensive evidence does not appear to be necessary."
In a statement, Sen. Durenberger said: "I am absolutely confident that I will be exonerated in a trial and I look forward to vindication."
Sen. Durenberger has been formally denounced by the Senate and had his law license suspended for falsifying reports relating to his Minnesota expenses.
The new indictment says the senator hid his ownership in a condominium so the government would reimburse him for his stays there.
According to prosecutors, Sen. Durenberger submitted fraudulent vouchers for $3,825 for visits to the condo.
If convicted, he faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
