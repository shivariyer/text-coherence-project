Closely held U-Haul International Inc. said it terminated its offer to pay $357.5 million for partnerships that own 139 self-service storage centers, ending a two-month takeover battle.
The truck and trailer rental concern's move came shortly after Shurgard Inc., the closely held Seattle concern that manages the storage centers, announced that holders of a majority of the outstanding units in each of the 17 limited partnerships involved had voted in favor of consolidating the partnerships into a publicly traded real estate investment trust.
U-Haul's burgeoning storage business includes more than 700 facilities in the U.S. and Canada.
In December, its Amerco unit made an unsolicited bid to acquire the partnerships managed by Shurgard, whose controlling shareholder is a general partner of all the partnerships.
Claiming that U-Haul's bid fell well short of the partnerships' net asset value and their likely valuation by the stock market, the general partners subsequently launched their counteroffer, which gives limited partners the option to receive as much as $180 million in cash, in addition to stock in the new entity.
U-Haul said that through its Oxford Life Insurance Co. affiliate, it would use funds previously allocated for the Shurgard properties acquisition to fund a new direct-loan program to help self-storage facility owners refinance loans.
