Your Jan. 11 Marketplace article on U.S. consumer overuse of nonprescription medicines failed even to acknowledge the essential point that nonprescription medicines today are serious, safe and reliable contributors to health care -- in cost effectiveness, convenience and in offering ever widening opportunities for Americans to seek relief from everyday illnesses and injuries.
You quoted a half-dozen or so individuals giving anecdotal evidence that Americans overuse nonprescription medicines.
But you failed to mention even one of the nine U.S. studies -- all published and all available to the most casual researcher -- which since 1984 have repeatedly documented that Americans are cautious and responsible in using self-medications, prefer to tough out everyday aches and pains when they can and resort to nonprescription medical relief only about one-third of the time they report a problem.
Heller studies in 1983 and again in 1992, for example, show beyond reasonable argument that American consumers are knowledgeable about the medicines they use in the home and generally understand the benefits as well as the limitations of self-medication.
The story is a disservice to thousands of your readers who because of cost considerations, personal convenience and a sense of self-empowerment continue to turn to doing for themselves when they can in their own health care.
And the facts show they generally do a good job.
