After six months of waiting, Paramount Communications Inc. shareholders will begin today receiving cash payments for more than half their holdings from Viacom Inc.
Taking another step toward completing the purchase of the entertainment giant, cable-television concern Viacom said yesterday it would accept today 61.7 million, or 51.7404%, of the shares tendered to it by Paramount shareholders.
Viacom will pay $107 for each of the shares.
In a second step, Viacom will swap a package of securities for the remaining Paramount shares in several weeks.
Separately, Viacom also said yesterday that it received $1.25 billion yesterday from Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., to be used to help pay for the Paramount stock.
Viacom in January agreed to acquire Blockbuster in a stock-for-stock transaction in a move to strengthen Viacom's hand in the then continuing battle with QVC Inc. for Paramount.
And as an interim step in the proposed Viacom-Blockbuster deal, the video-rental giant agreed to acquire 23 million shares of Viacom Class B stock for the $1.25 billion.
Blockbuster shareholders are scheduled to vote on the proposed acquisition by Viacom in late April or early May.
The transaction faces opposition from Blockbuster holders because Viacom's shares have declined in value since the deal was announced.
