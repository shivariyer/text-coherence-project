SynOptics Communications Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., said fourth-quarter net soared 65% on an 81% surge in revenue, but the results were slightly below analysts' expectations.
Net income for the quarter was $23.8 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with Wall Street's expectations of 36 cents a share.
A year earlier, net was $16.9 million, or 25 cents a share.
Revenue was $188.3 million, up from $130.5 million a year earlier.
Synoptics attributed the growth to its "strong position in a fast-growing market."
In a sign that growth is slowing for the maker of data-switching devices, revenue rose slightly from the previous quarter's revenue of $183.3 million.
What's more, fourth-quarter backlog plunged to $46 million for the recent quarter, from $118 million a year earlier, Montgomery Securities analyst Richard Kimball said.
Mr. Kimball attributed the slowdown to SynOptics's transition to its new System 5000 hub product, which is now being shipped with few features.
"New products have got to ship more fully featured before they get revenue growth," he said.
