Allied-Lyons PLC, a British beverage concern, said its Hiram Walker spirits and wines unit acquired Privat Weinbrennerei Jacobi GmbH, a German distributor.
Allied-Lyons said the consideration paid wasn't material to its net assets.
Jacobi has been distributing certain Hiram Walker brands since last August.
Beginning in April, Jacobi will assume responsibility for the sales and marketing of additional Hiram Walker brands that have been distributed by UNI Handelsgesellschaft GmbH, Allied-Lyons said.
The company said the acquisition completes its plans to streamline distribution operations in France and Germany.
A distribution pact with another German company, Borco, will be maintained, Allied-Lyons said.
Borco, Jacobi and UNI distribute different Hiram Walker brands.
