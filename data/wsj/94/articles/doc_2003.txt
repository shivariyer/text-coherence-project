President Clinton selected Susan Ness, a Washington attorney, to fill a vacant seat on the Federal Communications Commission.
Ms. Ness, a communications attorney and former fund-raiser for the Clinton-Gore campaign, had been a senior lender and later a group head in the communications-industries division of American Security Bank in Washington.
She had been assistant counsel to the House Banking Committee, and had founded and directed the judicial-appointments project of the National Women's Political Caucus.
On Senate confirmation, she will fill a seat vacated by Ervin Duggan.
Ms. Ness, 45 years old, has a law degree from Boston College Law School and a master's degree in business administration from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
