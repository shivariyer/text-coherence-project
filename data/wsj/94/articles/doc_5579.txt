American Nursery Products Inc. said a bankruptcy judge approved the company's plan to emerge from Chapter 11.
Under the plan, secured lenders agreed to convert $17 million of debt into stock in the grower and shipper of trees and shrubs.
Lenders also agreed to restructure $17 million in debt, giving it a lower interest rate, and to provide a $5 million line of credit.
The company said most trade creditors will get 80% of their claims, while investors who held stock in the company will lose their investment.
