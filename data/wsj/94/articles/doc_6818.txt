Western Resources Inc. said it would redeem $99 million of several series of its first mortgage bonds March 4.
The company said it would redeem its 8 1/8% series due 2007 at a price of 100; its 7 5/8% series due 1999 at 100.12; and its 8 5/8% series due 2017 at 105.054.
The bonds will be redeemed with funds that resulted from the company's sale of its Missouri gas properties to Southern Union Co. last month.
Western Resources provides natural-gas service in Kansas and northern Oklahoma and electric service to customers in eastern and central Kansas.
