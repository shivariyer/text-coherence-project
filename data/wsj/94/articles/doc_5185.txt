The United Steelworkers of America filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board seeking a representation vote among workers at an AK Steel Holding Corp. plant here.
The plant, which has been represented by an independent union for several decades, employs about 3,500 workers.
The vote was endorsed by the independent union's executive committee.
The company "has changed," said Ed Shelley, president of the independent union.
"They're not the same company we've been dealing with the last 50 years."
Mr. Shelley added that the workers required the United Steelworkers' "clout" to win a contract on par with the industry.
The independent union's current contract, which precludes a lockout or strike, expires Feb. 28, according to AK Steel.
Management and the union are currently before arbitrators.
The union's petition comes at a crucial time for AK Steel, formerly Armco Steel Co.
The 50-50 joint venture between Armco Inc. and Kawasaki Steel Corp. recently filed for an initial public offering of stock and debt with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could raise about $610 million in equity and about $275 million in debt.
