Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Ing.
C. Olivetti & Co., said the Italian computer maker is "shooting" to break even for 1994, saying it's an achievable goal if things continue going as they did in 1993.
Olivetti reported a consolidated loss of 650 million lire ($384,865) in 1992.
Mr. De Benedetti, speaking to reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, wouldn't comment on full-year 1993 profit, but said that 1993 was a "turning point," since it was the first time in three years that sales increased.
Olivetti recently reported that 1993 sales were up 7.3% to 8.6 trillion lire ($5.09 billion).
That showed, he said, that the company has "completed the most important part of its restructuring."
Olivetti saw its work force reduced to 35,000 in 1993 from 58,000 three years ago.
Mr. De Benedetti said he couldn't rule out the possibility of a capital increase, but added that Olivetti doesn't really need the money right now.
The board recently agreed to ask shareholders for a capital increase of one trillion lire in cash and a similar amount in bonds in a five-year period in one or more operations.
