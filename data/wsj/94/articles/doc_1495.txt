Panhandle Eastern Corp. said a partnership in which a company unit is a member filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval to develop a $24 million natural gas storage field in southwestern Pennsylvania.
The gas pipeline company said in Houston that the general partnership, Riverside Gas Storage Co., was formed by a unit of Panhandle Eastern's Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and a unit of Equitable Resources Inc., a natural gas company based in Pittsburgh.
Panhandle Eastern said the field will have a working storage capacity of about 3.1 billion cubic feet of gas and is scheduled to begin storing gas in the spring of 1995.
