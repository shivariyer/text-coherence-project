GenCorp Inc., Fairlawn, Ohio, said while its 1993 financial performance met its expectations, it expects sales for fiscal 1994 to be "down from 1993 levels," but declined to give specific numbers.
The company has a more optimistic outlook regarding profit for the year, but cautions that profit improvement will depend on the rate of economic growth and the success of its cost-reduction programs.
For the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, GenCorp reported net income rose 94% to $42.8 million, or $1.35 a share, compared with $22.1 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales fell slightly to $1.9 billion.
The aerospace, automotive and polymer-products concern said for fiscal 1994 it expects to see growth in its commercial businesses, namely polymer products and automotive operations, but expects "a substantial decline " in defense and aerospace businesses.
