A federal judge in Future Communications Inc.'s bankruptcy-court proceedings converted the case to Chapter 7 and appointed an independent trustee to oversee the company's operations.
Shareholders of the cable television and programming company in Dallas, had sought the judge's ruling.
An attorney for John H. Litzler, the trustee, said the judge, Steven A. Felsenthal, is allowing Mr. Litzler 10 days to determine if Future can be operated or if its assets should be liquidated.
The company had been operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which protects a debtor from its creditors while it attempts to reorganize its business.
Chapter 7 governs liquidations.
Mr. Litzler's attorney, Michael Quilling, said the trustee has assumed control of Future.
He said Mr. Litzler plans to meet with Future's officers today and arrange to examine the company's books.
Company officials couldn't be reached for comment.
