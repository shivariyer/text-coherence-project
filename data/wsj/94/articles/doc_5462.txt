Magma Copper Co. said it increased the reserves of copper ore at its pending Robinson Mine near Ely, Nev., by 25% to 252 million tons of ore.
The increase boosts reserves at the mine site to 2.1 billion pounds of recoverable copper and 1.9 million ounces of gold.
The Tucson company boosted its total copper reserves by 50% over 1993, to 7.7 billion pounds on Jan. 1, 1994, from 5 billion pounds on January 1, 1993.
Magma released the reserve numbers as part of the "growth story" it will begin spreading to analysts in meetings today.
"We're a company that's had limited reserves and increasing ore production," said President and Chief Executive J. Burgess Winter in an interview.
"We're excited about this increase in reserves."
