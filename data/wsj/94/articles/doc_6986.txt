Your Dec. 14 Labor Letter about office building janitors in Washington states that "the Service Employees Union says the nation's capital is the first major city to go union for janitors since before World War II."
Washington, D.C., is not a union city and never will be for janitors.
As one of the largest janitorial companies in Washington, we can firmly state that the free-enterprise system is alive and well.
In fact, more than 80% of the nongovernment buildings do not have any union contracts, a figure unchanged in the past 10 years.
