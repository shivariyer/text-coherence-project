The European Union Commission approved the joint acquisition of British Newspaper Publishing PLC by Spanish media group Promotora de Informaciones S.A., or Prisa, Italy's Editoriale l'Espresso SpA and U.K. newspaper group Mirror Group Newspapers PLC.
In a statement, the commission said the acquisition doesn't create competition worries because the Spanish and Italian companies operate on different markets to their acquisition, while the Mirror Group operates in a different part of the U.K. newspaper market from Newspaper Publishing.
Newspaper Publishing owns British broadsheets the Independent and the Independent on Sunday, while Mirror Group publishes tabloid and regional newspapers.
