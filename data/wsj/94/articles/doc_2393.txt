Mechanics at Spain's state airline Iberia SA have decided to give up salary increases for the last four months of 1993 and all of 1994.
In an effort to ease the airline's financial difficulties, the flight mechanics union also agreed to voluntary redundancies for workers between 58 and 60 years of age, Iberia said.
