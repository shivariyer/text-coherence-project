Southern New England Telecommunications Corp., New Haven, Conn., said it would spend $4.5 billion during the next 15 years to enhance the state's telecommunications system.
The company, which owns Southern New England Telephone, said the spending program will seek to create a state-wide "information superhighway" reaching about 500,000 homes and businesses within three years.
By 2009, Southern New England Telephone said, all its customers will have access to the new telecommunications system.
In July 1993, the company was encouraged by state regulators to more aggressively pursue investment in Connecticut's telecommunications infrastructure.
At the time, regulators said Southern New England's proposed modernization plans "didn't go far enough."
Yesterday, regulators "welcomed" the company's stepped-up telecommunications program.
