Yields on taxable money-market funds rose in the week ended Tuesday, reflecting the Federal Reserve's recent increase in short-term interest rates.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compound yield on taxable funds edged up to 2.79% from 2.75%, according to Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass., newsletter.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
The seven-day simple yield on taxable funds rose to 2.75% from 2.71%, while the 30-day simple yield inched up to 2.71% from 2.69%.
The 30-day compound yield crept to 2.74% from 2.73%.
Assets of 642 taxable funds (five more than the previous week) fell $8.50 billion, to $473.07 billion, the newsletter said.
Institutional investors accounted for $7.86 billion of the total outflow, while individual investors took out the remaining $639.2 million.
Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments, which include commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and Treasury bills, was shortened by three days, to 59 days.
"This is a classic textbook example of how money funds respond to moves by the Fed," said Walter Frank, chief economist for Money Fund Report.
As money-market yields rise, money funds shorten their the average portfolio maturity as both a competitive tactic and as a cautionary move against future rate increases.
The average tax-exempt seven-day compound yield rose to 1.92%, from 1.82%, in the latest week.
The latest tax-free yield is equivalent to a taxable 3% for someone paying 36% in taxes and to 3.18% for those who pay 39.6%.
Assets of 343 tax-exempt funds slipped $397.5 million, to $111.51 billion, according to the newsletter.
The tax-free funds' average portfolio maturity was shortened by one day, to 55 days.
