As your Dec. 22 article "CFTC Suspends Three Traders Convicted After Sting Operation" lacked any comment from the perspective of the U.S. futures industry, we are compelled to write this letter on behalf of the members of the Chicago Board of Trade.
The CBT is on record with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as being opposed to the action referred to in the article.
The manner in which this action was taken evidences the commission's grossly unfair treatment of these individuals and highlights a bureaucratic process that amounts to regulatory overkill.
The individuals in question are currently subject to CFTC enforcement actions pending before the commission.
Any decision regarding their floor-trading status should be the result of a careful, detailed analysis and fair judgment of the individual, specific conduct at issue.
The CFTC's enforcement action appeal should provide that process.
Use of the floor trader denial process while enforcement actions are pending at the CFTC ignores the critical specific circumstances of each individual's case and denies them the fundamental fairness to which they are entitled.
It should be obvious to anyone of reasonable intelligence and fairness that this floor trader registration denial amounts to a judgment by the CFTC regarding the status of these individuals as floor traders while that precise issue is pending before the commission in the enforcement proceedings.
The Chicago Board of Trade feels it is manifestly unfair for the CFTC to prejudge the final determination of these enforcement proceedings through the "back door" means of denying floor trader registration status.
