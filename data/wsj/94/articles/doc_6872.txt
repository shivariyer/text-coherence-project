AB Electrolux's earnings more than doubled in the fourth quarter and jumped a better-than-expected 52% for the full year.
The news pushed the Swedish appliance maker's shares up 7.3% in heavy trading in Stockholm yesterday.
The profit surge was attributed to the weaker Swedish krona, which ballooned the value of earnings abroad, and the positive effects of tough restructuring and cost-cutting programs.
Pretax profit jumped to 589 million kronor ($74.7 million) for the fourth quarter from 280 million kronor a year earlier, as sales rose 20% to 25.85 billion kronor from 21.48 billion kronor.
For the full year, pretax profit jumped to 1.55 billion kronor from 1.02 billion kronor.
Sales climbed 24% to 100.1 billion kronor from 80.44 billion the previous year.
