Mellon Bank Corp.
Chairman Frank V. Cahouet earned $3.7 million in salary, bonuses and other compensation last year, a 44% increase from 1992.
Most of the increase came in the form of a $2.1 million cash bonus, which can only be used to buy Mellon stock.
That was up from $1.2 million in 1992.
According to Mellon's 1994 proxy statement, Mr. Cahouet received a base salary of $760,000, compared to $726,667 in 1992, and a bonus of $625,000, up from $570,000.
He received $196,280 in life-insurance premiums, deferred interest, and other services, up from $78,300 in 1992.
He was granted 166,670 in stock options, down from 290,000 options granted last year.
Mr. Cahouet also exercised options on 318,911 shares valued at $8 million, in part by using the $2.1 million cash bonus.
He owns a total of 420,420 options, each to buy one share of Mellon common stock.
During 1993, Mellon, a bank-holding company with $36 billion in assets, plunged into the mutual fund business by agreeing to acquire Dreyfus Corp., and completed the acquisition of Boston Co.
The 61-year-old Mr. Cahouet also holds the titles of chief executive officer and president.
