Investors in Euro Disney SCA will no doubt thank Raymond Sokolov (author of "French, Spanish Kill Art with Kindness," Leisure & Arts, Dec. 29) for getting a bit of their own back at the Old World ingrates who have shunned their fine theme park.
However, one wonders if the rest of your readers wouldn't prefer a candid view of European cultural policy to the rather tendentious picture Mr. Sokolov presents.
They might, for instance, be interested to learn that (unlike Americans, perhaps) the French are by and large under no illusions about "Yankee junk art" being art at all; or, for that matter, "U.S. popular culture" being culture.
On the whole, French people recognize that what "cultural consumers" and "art proles" pay for is neither culture nor art, but merely "product."
The simple fact that a French newspaper lists showtimes for "Germinal" and "Jurassic Park" under the single rubric "Ars et Spectacles" doesn't leave many readers wondering which is art and which spectacle.
Moreover, it is precisely to ensure there is an adequate supply of both on offer that the French government has been "ratcheting up restrictions on audiovisual imports."
Nor, in so doing, is it by any means acting to constrain democratic freedom of choice.
On the contrary, it is trying to maintain the far broader free choice afforded by "the so-called cultural exception," as compared with that prevailing in unbridled free markets.
After all, as Mr. Sokolov himself admits, in addition to European-made films "Marie-Yvonne and Thierry can still see `Jurassic Park' if they want."
Yes, and as many more "wildly popular" American movies as they please.
But what about their American counterparts?
Of the various Oscar nominees for Best Foreign Film, how many Americans living outside New York or San Francisco will have had a chance to see more than a single (probably dubbed) specimen?
Laissez-faire has effectively left them with little choice but to take what Hollywood dishes up.
