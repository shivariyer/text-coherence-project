First Union Corp., continuing to expand its operations in Florida, said it agreed to acquire BancFlorida Financial Corp. in a stock swap valued at about $168 million.
Separately, the bank-holding company reported that fourth-quarter earnings jumped to $195.3 million, or $1.12 a share, from a restated $17.4 million, or five cents a share, a year earlier.
First Union originally reported 1992 fourth-period earnings of $134.8 million, or 95 cents a share.
The lastest period's results reflected unusually strong loan growth and healthy securities fees.
BancFlorida, with 37 offices and about $1.5 billion in assets, will fill a critical gap for First Union in the southwest corner of Florida.
Analysts said the only hazard for First Union is BancFlorida's troubled loan portfolio.
Its nonperforming assets are about 4% of total assets, roughly twice the industry average.
Still, First Union said it is confident it can help BancFlorida, which is based in Naples, shore up its balance sheet.
"We think they have a good handle on their credit problems," said Malcolm Murray, First Union's chief credit officer.
First Union also expects to be able to shave as much as 35% from BancFlorida's annual noninterest expenses once the two companies complete their consolidation.
Under the agreement, BancFlorida shareholders will receive $28 to $30 of First Union common stock for each of their shares, based on the market price of First Union's stock after the acquisition is completed.
First Union also will buy back half of the issued shares on the open market after the transaction is closed to minimize the number of new shares on the market.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, BancFlorida shares closed at $26.875, up $3.875, or 17%.
First Union shares closed at $42.375, up 50 cents.
For all of 1993, First Union reported net income of $817.5 million, or $4.73 a share, compared with a restated $385.1 million, or $2.23 a share.
The bank said 1992 results were restated to account for acquisitions.
First Union said tax-equivalent net interest income rose 12% in 1993.
The bank's fee income, from securities and capital management, jumped 13%.
