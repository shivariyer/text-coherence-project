On the same day he was accusing critics of his health care plan of "propaganda," President Clinton was also quoted in yesterday's news heaping obloquy on critics of Deval Patrick, his nominee for Justice's civil-rights post.
Mr. Clinton says the critics "never believed in the civil-rights laws, they never believed in equal opportunity, they never lifted a finger to give anybody of a minority race a chance in this country."
This is a very encouraging performance.
It suggests that Mr. Clinton has decided it is time to personally stand by his nominees.
