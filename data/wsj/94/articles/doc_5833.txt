British chemicals concern BOC Group PLC posted a pretax loss for the first quarter ended Dec. 31, after taking a restructuring charge of #85 million ($124.1 million).
Profit from its health-care division was hit by a patent expiration in the U.S.
The pretax loss totaled #8.9 million, compared with pretax earnings of #90.8 million a year earlier.
Sales rose 8.6% to #843.5 million from #776.8 million.
Operating profit from health care plunged to #14 million from #32.6 million, as the patent of its leading product, the Forane anaesthetic, expired in January of last year in the U.S.
The #85 million provision, first announced Jan. 20, includes a #25 million charge for the restructuring of the company's gases business, while the rest will go toward the revamping the health-care operations.
