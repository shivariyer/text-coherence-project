McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said special items caused its loss for the fourth quarter of 1993 to more than triple from year-ago levels, but the number of subscribers to its cellular-phone systems soared.
The company, whose acquisition by American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is expected to be completed in the third quarter, reported a net loss of $207.5 million, or $1 a share, compared with a net loss of $62.7 million, or 34 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
The results are adjusted for McCaw's 52% interest in LIN Broadcasting Corp., a cellular operator and broadcast concern.
The increased loss stemmed from a $77 million pretax write-down of equipment, a $79 million pretax write-off of unamortized bank fees and a $45 million after-tax extraordinary charge on early extinguishment of debt.
McCaw has reported losses for many quarters because of the heavy use of debt to build the nation's largest cellular-phone network.
But other operating results provided more evidence that cellular phone usage is accelerating rapidly in this country, as lower prices of the phones and better service attract consumers in addition to business users.
The company said it added a record 239,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter, more than twice the growth of the year-ago period.
Total revenue jumped 24% to $611.7 million from $494.2 million.
For the year, McCaw said the number of subscribers jumped 37%, to three million as of Dec. 31.
The net loss for the year fell slightly to $272.3 million, or $1.34 a share, from a net loss of $285.6 million, or $1.60 a share, a year earlier.
The weighted average shares outstanding increased to 202.9 million from 182.7 million.
Revenue rose 26% to $2.19 billion from $1.74 billion.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, McCaw closed at $52.25, down 12.5 cents.
