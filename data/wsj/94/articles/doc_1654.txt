Smaller stocks had "paused to blow off a little steam" in the past six weeks, said Alfred Goldman, director of technical research at A.G. Edwards & Sons.

Market players also said today's "triple-witching" session, during which stock futures and options expire, was unable to move stock prices lower.

On the American Stock Exchange, trading has been halted in Wilshire Technologies until the Carlsbad, Calif., company restates its fiscal 1993 financial results, the exchange said.
Wilshire, which markets disposable products for medical and cleanroom use, said it will restate its results from the year ended Nov. 30 from a $2 million profit, or 54 cents a share, to a "substantial loss."
Last month, Wilshire issued a statement in which it disputed a contention by Jerry Melin, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York, that Wilshire's financial results included fictitious revenue and earnings that would be reversed by its independent auditors.
"We're confident our analysis was -- and is -- correct," Mr. Melin said yesterday.
"Their prospects for significant profitability remain very dim."
