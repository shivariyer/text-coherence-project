Blount Inc. said it signed a letter of intent to sell a major portion of its construction division to Caddell Construction Co. of Montgomery, Ala.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The sale won't include Blount's Pozzo Construction Co. subsidiary.
But Blount, also based in Montgomery, said it will eventually dispose of that operation.
Winton M. Blount, chairman, said the move will eliminate substantial operating losses Blount has experienced in its construction operations over the past several years.
He said the decision will help to focus the company's resources on growing its manufacturing businesses.
In fiscal 1993, Blount had net income of $7.2 million, or 59 cents a share, on $691.4 million in sales.
