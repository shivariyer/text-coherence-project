Imperial Chemical Industries PLC reported a sharp rise in 1993 profit from a depressed 1992, forecasting "sustained growth" in the U.S. and a "modestly promising" outlook in Europe.
The chemical giant's pretax profit from continuing operations before exceptional items rose 78% to #290 million ($428.8 million), or 20.4 pence (30.2 cents) a share, from #163 million, or 3.2 pence a share, in 1992.
Revenue from continuing operations climbed 12% to #8.43 billion from #7.56 billion.
The results from continuing operations exclude those of ICI's former pharmaceutical and agrochemical unit, Zeneca Group PLC, with which ICI split in a #1.3 billion public offering last year.
Including discontinued operations and exceptional items, ICI had pretax profit of #374 million, compared with a loss of #384 million in 1992.
For the fourth quarter, ICI's pretax profit from continuing operations was #43 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of #11 million.
However, analysts pointed out that ICI's 1993 improvement came strictly from currency benefits and cost savings and warned that a recovery in the chemical industry isn't likely in 1994.
U.K. brokerage firms James Capel and Kleinwort Benson reduced their 1994 forecasts.
"The market remains extremely competitive and I don't see that changing in 1994," said David Ingles, an analyst with James Capel in London.
Mr. Ingles said ICI's cost savings will slow in 1994 and its currency gains will evaporate.
With prices still sluggish, he thinks ICI may not show robust results before 1997.
ICI's results, though seen well below healthy levels, are expected to top 1993 results for chemical producers in continental Europe.
The improved results suggest ICI is succeeding in shedding assets to concentrate on core operations.
The company pointed out that its controversial split with Zeneca Group PLC has increased the companies' combined market value to #13.7 billion, including the #1.3 billion raised by the issue, from #7.6 billion a year earlier.
"There is evidence of greater focus within ICI on improving the underlying level of earnings in the businesses," said Kleinwort Benson analyst Jeremy Chantry.
ICI left its annual dividend unchanged at 27.5 pence.
Sir Denys Henderson, ICI's chairman, warned that the company wanted to "rebuild cover" for the dividend, which has exceeded earnings per share.
The company also said its debt, at 10.3% of capital, "places ICI in a very strong position to capitalize on the opportunities ahead."
Though some analysts expect acquisitions, particularly in petrochemicals, the company didn't detail acquisition plans.
It said its asset sales would continue in 1994.
Profit from ICI's paints business declined in 1993 on slumps in North America and Europe, but the industrial-chemicals business reversed a year-earlier loss.
