The Public Oversight Board, an independent self-regulatory body, has formed a blue-ribbon panel to see whether auditors really stand up to their clients.
The board action follows criticism of outside auditors by Walter P. Schuetze, chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Last January, Mr. Schuetze said that accountants have become "cheerleaders" for their clients.
Mr. Schuetze cited recent audit failures and big accounting firms' efforts to stop accounting profession rulemakers from forcing their corporate clients to deduct employee stock-option costs from profits.
A.A. Sommer Jr., the oversight board's chairman and a former SEC commissioner, said "it appears that events have eroded public confidence in the accounting profession."
The panel will report its findings to the SEC and the public in late spring.
Panel members are Donald J. Kirk, former chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the chief rule-making body for accountants; Ralph S. Saul, former president of the American Stock Exchange; and George D. Anderson, former chairman of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
The oversight board, created by the institute, independently monitors accounting firms with public corporations as clients.
