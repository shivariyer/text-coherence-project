Qualcomm Inc. has enlisted a unit of Sony Corp. to help design and manufacture computerized wireless telephones.
The companies said they will set up a factory in San Diego as part of a joint venture backed with $52 million from the two.
Qualcomm will own 51% of the venture; Sony Electronics Inc. will own 49%.
The two companies will independently market phone products.
Qualcomm is the inventor of code multiple access, or CDMA, a digital-communications technology that is expected to offer 10 to 20 times the capacity of existing cellular systems.
It has been seeking to outflank a rival technology, time division multiple access, as an industry standard.
The venture, Qualcomm Personal Electronics, will develop pocket phones and other products for both digital cellular applications and personal communications services, another wireless communications technology.
The factory is expected to begin producing phones late this year and to be in full production in the first quarter of next year, Qualcomm said.
