John Lakian resigned as chairman but will remain a board member, the residential mortgage banking company said.
Board members elected Stephen H. Dickmann, Farragut's president and chief executive officer, as chairman.
The company said Mr. Lakian, who isn't an executive of the company, resigned as chairman "to pursue personal interests."
