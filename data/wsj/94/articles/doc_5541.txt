Machinery and plant-engineering group Deutsche Babcock AG said it will pay an unchanged dividend of three marks ($1.71) a preferred share for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
The company hasn't paid a dividend on common shares since fiscal 1988.
Last year, Babcock paid the preferred-share dividends it missed in fiscal 1990 and 1991.
The payment of the missed dividends on the preferred shares is a precondition for the resumption of the common-stock dividend, which was five marks in 1988.
Deutsche Babcock also reported pretax profit for the fiscal year fell 50% to 62 million marks ($35.4 million) from 124 million marks in fiscal 1992.
In December, Deutsche Babcock told its employees pretax earnings fell to "around" 60 million marks, while sales rose 7.9% to 8.2 billion marks.
"Operating profit didn't worsen" in the latest year, a company spokesman said.
Instead, the decline in pretax profit was due to extraordinary items.
In fiscal 1992, the sale of real estate inflated Deutsche Babcock's earnings, while earnings in fiscal 1993 were hit by one-time expenses related to restructuring and layoffs, he said.
The company won't release further details on fiscal 1993 until its annual earnings news conference May 12, the spokesman said.
