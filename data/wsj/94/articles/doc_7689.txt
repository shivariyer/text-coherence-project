Philip Morris Cos. reported steep declines in profit for the quarter and the year, reflecting its decision in April to slash prices on premium cigarette brands, and its previously announced restructuring charges.
For the quarter, the tobacco and food giant said net income fell 72% to $339 million, or 38 cents a share, from $1.2 billion, or $1.34 a share, a year earlier.
A restructuring charge announced in November to cover the elimination of 14,000 jobs, or 8% of the company's world-wide work force, and to close as many as 40 plants, reduced earnings $457 million, or 52 cents a share.
Revenue in the quarter fell 1.4% to $14.71 billion from $14.92 billion.
Michael A. Miles, chairman and chief executive officer, said Philip Morris emerged from the year as a stronger, more-competitive company overall.
He said cost reductions "should contribute to 1994 profit growth in all our businesses."
For the year, operating profit at the company's domestic tobacco business was down 46%, slightly more than the company predicted in November, to $2.8 billion from $5.19 billion in 1992.
The drop came as the company slashed prices on its Marlboro brand and other premium brands as much as 20%, in response to increasing competition by discount brands.
Philip Morris said the strategy helped it to regain market share in the premium category.
In November, the company raised prices about 5% on premium brands and about 7% on discount brands.
Analysts expect further price increases this year.
The results were "boring from a numbers standpoint . . . but the '94 numbers are shaping up to be better than people expected, particularly for domestic tobacco, because the price war is over," said Gary Black of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Philip Morris shares jumped $1.375 to $59.25.
The stock has nearly recovered after plunging more than 20% to below $50 in the wake of April's announcement, reflecting stability in domestic tobacco products, said Leigh Ferst of Prudential Securities.
But she expressed worry that the core businesses "could see a profit decline in 1995, when large federal excise-tax increases could go into effect to finance health-care reform."
For the year, Philip Morris posted a 37% decline in earnings to $3.09 billion, or $3.52 a share, from $4.94 billion, or $5.45 a share.
In addition to the restructuring charge, the 1993 results included a $495 million non-cash charge related to an accounting change for post-employment benefits.
Revenue rose 3% to $60.9 billion from $59.13 billion.
