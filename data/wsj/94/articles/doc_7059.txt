Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it upgraded Amphenol's $95 million issue of senior subordinated notes, due 2002, to single-B-1 from single-B-2.
Moody's said the upgrade reflects "the good returns and favorable outlook" of the coaxial cable business of Amphenol's Times Fiber unit, progress on debt reduction and the anticipated benefits of a possible stock sale.
Amphenol makes electrical, electronic and fiber optic equipment.
