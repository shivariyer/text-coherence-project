Franz-Josef Kortuem, chairman of Audi AG, the luxury-car division of Volkswagen AG, is expected to be ousted from his post today at an extraordinary meeting of the supervisory board, VW insiders said.
Both Audi and VW press offices refused to comment officially on reports of Mr. Kortuem's impending dismissal.
Audi said Mr. Kortuem wasn't available for comment.
Mr. Kortuem was installed just 13 months ago to succeed Ferdinand Piech, who became VW chairman.
Mr. Piech, who is himself under severe pressure to turn around Europe's largest and most troubled car maker, is said to want to replace Mr. Kortuem for what he deems to be unsatisfactory performance at Audi.
After posting a 508 million mark ($293.1 million) pretax profit in 1992 under Mr. Piech's management, Audi is expected to post a 1993 loss of around 240 million marks.
Sales in 1993 dropped 25% to 12.5 billion marks from 16.7 billion marks in 1992.
Mr. Kortuem's departure would come on the heels of Mr. Piech's dismissal in late September of Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, the chairman of VW's Spanish subsidiary, Seat SA.
Mr. Diaz Alvarez was faulted for broadsiding VW's recovery plans with a surprise loss of 1.4 billion marks at Seat last year.
Mr. Kortuem is expected to be succeeded by Audi's current chief for technical development, Herbert Demel.
But people close to VW said Mr. Demel will be given only the title of spokesman for the management board, not chairman.
