Italy's domestic telephone operator, Societa Italiana per l'Esercizio delle Telecomunicazioni SpA, said 1993 net income rose 43% to 657.4 billion lire ($393.8 million) from 460.6 billion lire in 1992.
Revenue rose 86% to 23.4 trillion lire from 12.56 trillion lire.
The company called its results "positive," and noted they were achieved in the face of a weak economy in Italy and internationally.
SIP's net indebtedness fell 4.7% to 22.183 trillion lire from 23.283 trillion lire at the end of 1992, the first year in which the debt level has fallen at the same time as revenue has risen, SIP said.
