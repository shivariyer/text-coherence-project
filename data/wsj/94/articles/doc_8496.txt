Brooklyn Union Gas Co. said it sent out a record 1.02 billion cubic feet of natural gas to customers Wednesday.
In a news release, Brooklyn Union Gas said it was the first time it sent out more than one billion cubic feet of natural gas in one day.
The company attributed the record demand to cold weather gripping the Northeast.
Wednesday's figure was an 8.5% increase from the previous record of 941 million cubic feet sent out Jan. 25, 1985.
Brooklyn Union said it has "more than adequate supplies" to meet demand from its 1.1 million customers.
