With technological help from Boeing Co., Taiwan opened its first quality control laboratory as part of a government-backed drive to broaden the high-tech industry.
The $3 million Quality Assurance Testing and Inspection Laboratory will "play a cornerstone role in Taiwan's efforts to develop its aerospace industry," said Richard Lin, director of the Industrial Technology Research Institute's Center for Aviation and Space Technology.
The lab is the first of its kind that the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group has helped establish outside of the U.S., institute officials told a news conference.
Before the lab was established, aerospace parts exporters had to send their products overseas to their buyers for quality checks before selling them.
The lab is certified by Boeing and will also seek certifications from other international airplane makers, Mr. Lin said.
Chinese aerospace officials have asked Boeing to help it build a similar lab, said Boeing executive Nelson Seto.
The Taiwan government expects annual aerospace production to reach $6 billion in 2000.
