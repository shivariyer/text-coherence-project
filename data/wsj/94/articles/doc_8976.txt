Mazda Motor Corp. said it expects domestic sales for 1994 to rebound 7.8% from last year but exports to edge down 1.6%.
Domestic sales would be 440,000, up from last year's 408,000, which was off 16% from the year before.
Exports would be 670,000, down from 681,000, which was off 15% from the year before.
Mazda, which is 25%-owned by Ford Motor Co., also forecast that total production will increase 7.3% to 1.1 million units.
Last year, production was down 20%.
Fumihiko Arakawa, Mazda's senior managing director in charge of domestic marketing and sales, said the company expects demand for autos in Japan will pick up in the second half with help from prospective further fiscal stimulus by the government.
Mr. Arakawa also believes that consumers, after holding back on purchases, will soon need to replace older cars.
