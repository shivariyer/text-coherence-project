A federal grand jury indicted Southmountain Coal Co. and two company officials in connection with an accident that killed eight miners in late 1992.
The company, based in Norton, Va., was charged with six felony counts and 11 misdemeanors, including violations of ventilation standards and failure to conduct safety checks.
In addition, the company is accused of falsifying records.
If convicted on all counts, the company could face as much as $8.5 million in criminal penalties.
Last year, the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration fined the company $439,172, the maximum possible for the eight violations uncovered after the explosion.
In its report in May on the accident, the agency's investigators found that insufficient ventilation in the mine led to a buildup of methane gas.
Company officials failed to detect the buildup because of inadequate examinations, the report said, and a cigarette lighter set off the explosion.
Southmountain's lawyers couldn't be reached to comment.
