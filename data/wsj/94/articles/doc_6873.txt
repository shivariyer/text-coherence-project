Reader's Digest Association Inc. said revenue declined but profit was up in its second quarter primarily because of lower promotional costs.
For the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, the Pleasantville, N.Y., company reported net income of $88.8 million, or 76 cents a share, up 26% from $70.4 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue slipped 1% to $802.1 million from $806.7 million.
The company said that it cut back on its promotional activity in its U.S. books and home entertainment business after seeing revenue in those areas decline.
Those moves helped the second-quarter results but Reader's Digest does not "expect the earnings growth rates in the first half to continue in the second half of 1994," said George V. Grune, chairman and chief executive officer.
Shares of Reader's Digest gained 50 cents to $44.50 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
