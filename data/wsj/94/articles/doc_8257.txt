The nation's largest cable networks are finalizing a plan to address violence in programming by developing a ratings system and the use of an independent monitor.
The plan, the details of which are still being worked out, could be unveiled as early as this week, when the National Cable Television Association plans to brief Congress.
The issue is sharply dividing cable from its broadcast network counterparts, who are adamantly opposed to a ratings system.
The plan is a response to increasing calls from Congress, led by Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.) and Rep. Ed Markey (D., Mass.), to impose regulations on violence in TV programming.
Key points of the plan include setting up a violence ratings system for cable programming and the use of an independent monitor to report annually on the level of violent content.
The NCTA's programming committee endorsed the use of a V-chip, a technology that would allow viewers to block out certain shows containing violent scenes.
"Cable programmers are currently putting a comprehensive violence plan into final form," an NCTA spokeswoman said, "and we are encouraging the broadcasters to join us."
