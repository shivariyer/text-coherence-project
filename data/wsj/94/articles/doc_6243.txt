Banyan Systems Inc. said it agreed to acquire Beyond Inc., a closely held Burlington, Mass., developer of electronic messaging systems, for $17.5 million.
The acquisition, expected to be completed during the first quarter, could result in a one-time charge of about $11 million in the quarter, Banyan said.
The networking software product concern said the acquisition will enable it to integrate its messaging technology with Beyond's products to allow mutual customers to link different types of computers into client-server networks.
