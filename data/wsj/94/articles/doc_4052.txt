Scientific-Atlanta Inc., Atlanta, said it received a $2.2-million contract from Boeing Co.'s Defense & Space Group to supply test equipment in support of Boeing's work on the E-4B National Emergency Command Post aircraft.
In a news statement, Scientific-Atlanta said its electronic systems division will provide its model 2095 microwave measurement system, a radome test positioner, and its model 3842A autotrack controller, which will be used in a Scientific-Atlanta compact test range installed at Boeing's Kent, Wash., facility.
Scientific-Atlanta said the equipment will test the Triband Radomes used with Milstar satellite communications equipment carried aboard the modified 747 aircraft to support its command and control mission.
Milstar provides a jam-resistant satellite communications capability for the military's strategic and tactical forces, the company said.
