Chevron Corp.'s tortured history of offshore operations near here suffered yet another blow yesterday when bureaucratic indecision combined with the aftereffects of the Northridge earthquake made it likely that production will have to be cut to about one-fifth of capacity.
After huge investments and more than a decade of controversy over the Point Arguello field -- the largest domestic oil discovery since the late 1960s -- Chevron failed to meet a Feb. 1 deadline for a firm agreement to build a new pipeline to carry crude south to Los Angeles refineries.
Chevron and regulators previously agreed that without such an accord and without the necessary construction permits, no more tankers would be used to ship oil from the field.
But nobody factored in last month's earthquake.
The damage has temporarily shut down one of the pipelines serving Point Arguello.
A second line has temporarily reduced the amount of oil it is carrying.
State and county officials have put off Chevron's request to continue using tankers on an emergency basis.
So, Chevron is storing large amounts of crude in temporary tanks.
But by next week, unless the impasse is broken, production is likely to plummet to about 20,000 barrels a day in a field whose maximum is close to 100,000 barrels a day.
And company officials are fuming.
Chairman Kenneth Derr, who has argued that environmental controls on the industry are excessive and a "national disgrace," cites Point Arguello as spurring Chevron's increasing focus overseas.
