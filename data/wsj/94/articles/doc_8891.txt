McKesson Corp. said its PCS Health Systems unit has agreed to acquire a "significant minority interest" in Integrated Medical Systems Inc., a closely held concern that provides computer networks linking health-care providers.
The investment in the Golden, Colo., company will be announced tomorrow, said Kevin Moley, senior vice president of PCS, in an interview.
IMS, links health-care providers such as physicians, hospitals, laboratories and pharmacies with managed-care organizations and health-plan sponsors.
Swapping data over computer networks like IMS's can cut paperwork and costs, and improve health-care quality, Mr. Moley said.
A doctor tied into the system could, for example, use a personal computer to see if a planned prescription might be substituted for a lower-cost alternative, to check whether the patient has filled previous prescriptions or to make sure the planned prescription doesn't conflict with other drugs prescribed to the patient.
A doctor could also use a personal computer to tap into the system and retrieve lab results and images such as from X-rays or electrocardiograms.
Having the link with IMS will make PCS -- which sells its drug-payment services to health organizations and self-insured corporations -- more attractive to customers, Mr. Moley said.
"Employers and others want to provide health care in a more efficient, lower cost manner," Mr. Moley said, and electronics is one way to do that.
The IMS deal gives PCS a leg up on competitors, Mr. Moley said.
IMS operates 34 community health-information networks, including 23 in the top 50 U.S. markets.
IMS's networks are used by more than 7,500 doctors, up from 3,350 in 1992, Mr. Moley said.
"There is no other company that has this degree of connectivity as this small company in Golden, Colorado," Mr. Moley said.
