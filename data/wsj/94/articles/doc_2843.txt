Ford Motor Co. said it will be "aggressive in our spending levels" on the launch of its new Windstar minivan.
The Windstar is designed to compete head-on with the Chrysler Corp. minivan, which has dominated the market for a decade.
Ford is already running teaser ads touting Windstar as the new benchmark for minivans.
The tagline of the campaign, created by WPP Group PLC's J. Walter Thompson, says, "The Future of Minivans Begins Today."
John Vanderzee, Ford division advertising manager, said the expense of the Windstar launch will rate among Ford's top five launches, with the launch of the 1986 Taurus the biggest.
Ford is spending an estimated $50 million to launch Windstar, compared with spending about $65 million to launch the 1986 Taurus, according to Advertising Age, a trade publication.
