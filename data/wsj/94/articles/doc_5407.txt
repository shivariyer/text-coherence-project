Hobbled by weaker retail demand for its core women's sportswear, Liz Claiborne Inc., as expected, posted a 72% decline in fourth-quarter profit and a 42% drop in earnings for all of 1993.
The New York apparel maker said fourth-quarter net plunged to $14.9 million, or 19 cents a share, from $51.9 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales were flat at $544 million.
For 1993, Claiborne's profit fell to $126.9 million, or $1.56 a share, down from $218.8 million, or $2.61 a share, a year earlier.
Jerome Chazen, chairman and chief executive, said "without a doubt, 1993 was the toughest year we've ever had."
He added that "on the whole, we view 1994 as a year of rebuilding and restructuring."
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Claiborne shares closed at $20.50 a share, up 12.5 cents.
