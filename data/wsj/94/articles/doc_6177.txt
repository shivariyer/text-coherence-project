GKN PLC executed a dawn raid on Westland Group PLC in what market observers said could be the first salvo in the battle for the British helicopter maker.
GKN, a British automative-engineering and defense company, increased its 28.3% stake in Westland to 47% by buying the 18.7% stake held by United Technologies Corp., Hartford, Conn.
United Technologies said it paid about $40 million for the Westland stake in 1986, selling it this week for $111 million.
GKN then announced a subsequent bid for all of Westland's shares.
At 290 pence a share, the bid values Westland at 496 million pounds ($735.3 million).
At this price, GKN is bidding at a discount to Westland's 305 pence closing stock price Monday.
GKN believes its large stake gives it a strong enough hand to justify the low bid price.
But analysts believe GKN will be forced to pay more to win over shareholders.
Westland tersely termed the offer "unwelcome."
To help fund the acquisition, GKN launched a one-for-five convertible loan rights offering at 480 pence a share, raising 248 million pounds.
