The Clinton administration is considering shipping Patriot air-defense missiles to bolster U.S. forces in South Korea.
The move is being weighed to offset recent movements of artillery and missiles by North Korea to areas near its border with the South.
Patriot missiles, which were used to help defeat the threat of Iraqi Scud missiles in the Persian Gulf war, were withdrawn earlier from South Korea.
U.S. forces stationed near the North Korean border and Seoul, the South Korean capital, are particularly vulnerable to missile attacks.
Seoul is within 28 miles of the border, well within range of North Korea's artillery.
