A child who had been genetically screened for incurable Tay-Sachs disease as an eight-cell pre-embryo was born yesterday at Baptist Hospital in Orange, Texas.
The child was tested as a pre-embryo that had not yet been implanted into her mother's womb.
Doctors withdrew a single cell from eggs that were fertilized "in vitro," or outside the mother, tested for Tay-Sachs, and then three "clean" eggs were implanted in the mother's uterus.
Mother and daughter were doing well, said William E. Gibbons, the family's doctor at the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine here.
The baby's parents each carry the gene for Tay-Sachs, which killed their first daughter at age 3.
Without the test, they have a 25% chance of having a child with Tay-Sachs.
The technology could help couples who carry other inherited diseases, such as sickle-cell anemia and hemophilia.
Doctors in England recently used a similar procedure to help a couple predisposed to cystic fibrosis give birth to a healthy infant, said Michael Snabes of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College.
John Fletcher, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Virginia, praised the procedure but said it raises questions about future developments in handling defective genes.
"What people are afraid of is, once you start manipulating genes in the embryo, you could move from treating the disease to affecting characteristics that don't have anything to do with the disease, like skin color, height, weight."
