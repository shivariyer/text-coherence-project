Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on about $1.1 billion of the debt of Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. and removed the ratings from CreditWatch, where they were placed in October.
The ratings concern cited the Houston-based waste disposal concern's aggressive investment strategy which it said is "resulting in increased debt usage."
This, coupled with lower profitability due to industry conditions, "make it unlikely that cash-flow protection measures will return to historically strong levels," S&P added.
S&P said the company's rising capital expenditures, pending acquisition of a 50% stake in Otto Entsorgungsdienstleisdtung GmbH , a leading solid-waste firm in Germany, and opportunities overseas will require substantial external financing over the next several years.
All of these factors put pressure on the capital structure, which at 53% debt to total capital is "modestly aggressive," S&P said.
Browning-Ferris' senior debt was lowered to single-A from single-A-plus, and subordinated debt to single-A-minus from single-A.
The industrial-revenue bonds of American Ref-Fuel Co., a joint venture with Air Products & Chemicals Inc., were lowered to single-A from single-A-plus.
S&P said the ratings reflect the company's leading position as the second largest U.S. waste-services firm, strong cash flow from core solid-waste services, and expectations that management will take appropriate actions to limit debt usuage.
A spokesman for Browing-Ferris said the company is "naturally disappointed" by S&P's action, but the move wasn't unexpected.
He added that the ratings are in line with other ratings services.
