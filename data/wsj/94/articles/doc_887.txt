Harlyn Products Inc. said it reached agreements to market its jewelry products at several department store chains and catalog showrooms.
It said the new accounts represent a total of 1,500 outlets, and are expected to boost third and fourth-quarter business.
A spokesman declined to give earnings estimates for the third and fourth quarters.
Harlyn also said it reached an agreement with a Mexican distributor to test market its family jewelry lines in Mexico.
The program will be implemented in April for Mother's Day sales, it said.
