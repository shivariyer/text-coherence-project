Steel Partners II said it sent a letter to Esquire Radio & Electronics Inc. increasing an earlier offer to acquire all of Esquire's common shares outstanding.
Esquire, New York, develops telecommunications products for a Southwestern Bell Corp. unit.
In the letter, which Steel Partners said was sent Thursday, the New York-based investor group proposed to acquire the shares for $51.50 apiece in a negotiated merger transaction.
In November 1993, the partnership proposed a $50-a-share acquisition.
Last month Esquire said its board wasn't interested in discussing Steel Partners' $50-a-share proposal.
The partnership said the revised proposal expires March 21.
As of November, Esquire had 483,000 shares outstanding.
