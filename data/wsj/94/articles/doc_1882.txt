Time Inc. said it plans to launch a monthly celebrity-lifestyle publication in June, its first new broad-based magazine since Entertainment Weekly's debut four years ago.
Time, the magazine and publishing arm of Time Warner Inc., said the results of three test issues "proved overwhelmingly" that there's a demand for its new magazine, called In Style.
The four-color monthly, which features the home decor, fashion, beauty and charities of well-known people, is targeted to women aged 18 to 49.
Initially, it will be competing with fashion and lifestyle-type magazines, a spokeswoman said.
The magazine will have a rate base of 500,000, a full-page ad rate of $20,000 and a newsstand price of $2.95.
Martha Nelson, who was editor of the three test issues, will be managing editor, while Ann Jackson, who was general manager of the test issues, will be publisher.
