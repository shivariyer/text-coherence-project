Scientific-Atlanta Inc. said it agreed to provide as many as one million home-communication terminals to Time Warner Inc.'s cable unit over three years.
While terms weren't disclosed, news of the pact helped to push Scientific-Atlanta's share price to $31.125, up $3.50, or 13%, in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
The agreement is the latest evidence of Scientific-Atlanta's increasingly close relationship with Time Warner and its cable-TV unit, Time Warner Cable.
In May 1993, Time Warner Cable selected Scientific-Atlanta to supply a cable-converter box with personal-computing powers for Time Warner's new interactive cable system in Orlando, Fla.
The Florida system -- originally scheduled to be launched in April, but recently pushed back to the fourth quarter of this year -- will be the first to use digital rather than analog technology, offering movies on demand and interactive educational services, among other features.
The terminals, or set-top boxes, in the agreement announced Friday will be analog, but will have the ability to add advanced cable services as they become available.
Under the agreement, Time Warner Cable will buy 500,000 set-top boxes, known as 8600x terminals, over two years.
The number could reach as high as one million in the third year of the contract.
Time Warner Cable is the U.S.'s second-largest cable-TV operator, serving more than seven million homes in 36 states.
Scientific-Atlanta, a maker of telecommunications equipment, is expected to benefit from increases in capital spending within the cable industry, as more operators move to upgrade their systems.
