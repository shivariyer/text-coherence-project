Maxtor Corp., San Jose, Calif., said that key creditors agreed to keep open its line of credit despite its recent violation of certain terms of the loan.
The waiver of Maxtor's default by CIT Group/Business Credit Inc. buys time for the cash-starved computer disk-drive maker to obtain a $150 million cash infusion from South Korea's Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., which was announced last August.
At Hyundai's request, Maxtor extended to Feb. 3 the closing date of the transaction because of delays in getting Korean government approval.
Maxtor said the loan default occurred Dec. 25, the end of its fiscal third quarter.
Results for that quarter will be announced in early February.
