Sandoz AG announced a 14% jump in 1993 net income and increased its dividend.
The Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group also appointed Rolf W. Schweizer chief executive officer.
Although analysts widely expected a double-digit rise in earnings, they said a dividend improvement of 23% to 58 Swiss francs ($40.62) a share from 47 francs was greater than expected.
Sandoz also said its share capital would be simplified by converting nonvoting participation certificates into registered shares.
The remaining two categories of registered and bearer shares would be split in a ratio of 1 to 5.
Sandoz's profit rose to 1.71 billion francs in 1993 from 1.5 billion francs a year earlier.
The company said the growth was aided by increased drug sales and improved margins in the chemicals-and-environment sector.
The appointment of the 63-year-old Mr. Schweizer as chief executive also was unexpected.
He will succeed Marc Moret, 70, who kept the chairman and chief executive positions after Daniel C. Wagniere, 57, became chief operating officer last year.
Up until then, Mr. Moret had held all three positions.
Mr. Moret will continue as chairman.
