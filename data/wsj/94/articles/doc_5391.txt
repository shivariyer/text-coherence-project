Federated Department Stores Inc. will meet with creditors of R.H. Macy & Co. this week, the first formal steps by the department store retailer to woo creditors in its plan to merge with Macy.
Federated executives will meet with secured creditors of Macy, such as Fidelity Investments, today at the New York offices of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, the Cleveland-based law firm that represents Federated.
Federated confirmed it will meet Wednesday with Macy's unsecured creditors.
Federated recently paid $449.3 million to acquire half of Prudential Insurance Co. of America's holdings of certain Macy's debt.
The debt represents a major claim in Macy's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and its purchase gives Federated a major voice in fashioning a reorganization.
Federated has said it wants to merge with Macy, which has said it wants to remain independent.
Federated has been meeting quietly on a one-on-one basis with creditors' representatives -- eight major groups owed $6 billion by Macy -- to explain why it wanted to merge with Macy.
But this week marks the first official group meetings with creditors.
