Dime Savings Bank of New York said it will offer a $6 million mortgage program in Connecticut to settle a probe of its lending practices in the state.
The agreement with the state's attorney general and the state's banking department follows an inquiry of the lending practices of Dime Real Estate Services, Connecticut Inc., a real-estate services subsidiary.
The New York bank's program is intended to help some Dime customers who had fallen victim to the sharp and unexpected decline in the New England real-estate market in the 1980s.
The bank, which has maintained that its lending practices were not improper, said the agreement "could not be construed as implying any finding of wrongdoing."
The program is similar to one agreed to between the bank and the Massachusetts attorney general last week, Dime said.
Like the Massachusetts program, the Connecticut program would include provisions allowing borrowers facing foreclosure to restructure their loans, and those who have already lost their homes through foreclosure to apply for forgiveness of amounts still owed.
