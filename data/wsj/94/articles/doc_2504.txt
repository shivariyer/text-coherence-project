British aerospace manufacturer Rolls-Royce PLC said it swung to a profit in 1993 from a year-earlier loss.
Pretax profit was #76 million ($113.5 million) for 1993; a year earlier, the company had a loss of #184 million.
Sales fell slightly to #3.52 billion from #3.56 billion.
The pretax profit figure was in line with market forecasts.
"The markets in which we operate continue to be difficult," warned Rolls-Royce Chairman Ralph Robins.
"Over the past year, however, we have made substantial progress with our restructuring program, which will ensure that we maintain a world competitive capability."
Operating profit from aerospace operations totaled #20 million, compared with a loss of #220 million a year earlier, while sales declined slightly to #2.14 billion from #2.14 billion.
The fall in sales reflected moderate declines in both civil and military orders, Rolls-Royce said.
