Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif., said it may have developed a practical alternative to incandescent lamps.
The advance, which depends on a new technique that makes possible the world's brightest light-emitting diodes, could turn up in automobile taillights within two to three years, the company said.
Light-emitting diodes form the basis for various thin electronic screens.
Their lack of brightness has hampered their use in the past, but Hewlett-Packard said its light-emitting diodes are as much as four times brighter than those from rivals.
The company declined to forecast the size of the market for these new lights, but a spokesman said the technology could replace incandescent lamps in many situations, including traffic lights.
The company said it will begin selling sample quantities of the lights at midyear.
