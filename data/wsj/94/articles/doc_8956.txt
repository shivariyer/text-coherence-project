On the Border Cafes Inc. said it will report a $2.2 million charge for the fiscal fourth quarter to settle a claim relating to a plane crash last year that killed the company's chief executive.
The restaurant operator said the claim, filed by a woman injured in the accident, will be paid over six years.
The March crash killed Michael Fiori, then president and chief executive, and his son, William, the plane's pilot, and injured three other passengers.
The injured included Julie Simpson, wife of company human-resource director Hank Simpson.
Mrs. Simpson suffered broken ribs and vertebrae and liver injuries and subsequently filed a claim for damages.
Stephen D. Fenstermacher, current chief executive who also was injured in the accident, said the settlement ends all claims relating to the crash.
On the Border also expects to report an operating loss for the fourth quarter ended Jan. 3.
For the year-earlier quarter, the company had net income of $98,000, or three cents a share, on revenue of $6.6 million.
