Xerox Corp. said it will increase its service and sales prices by 3% to 7% for most document-processing products.
Sale prices for low and mid-volume copier products, which make up the bulk of Xerox's copier revenue, will be raised by 4% to 6% effective April 1 for all commercial customers, while sale prices for certain high-volume products will be raised 3% to 7%.
The company also said the price of its full-service maintenance agreements will be raised about 3%.
Xerox, of Stamford, Conn., had last increased the prices on the majority of its copier products by 2% to 5% last April.
A spokeswoman noted that Xerox's price increases were "in line" with similar increases by competitors.
