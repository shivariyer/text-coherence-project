A group of members of New York's Commodity Exchange filed suit against their exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange seeking to block a proposed merger of the two commodity markets.
The class-action lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court, New York County, also seeks damages of more than $18 million from the two exchanges and their boards.
The complaint alleges that the proposed merger plan ignores the interests of the 200 Comex traders who own memberships that allow them only to trade options contracts at the exchange, which is best known for its precious-metals derivatives contracts.
Under the merger proposal, regular Comex members would receive $70 million as part of the acquisition of their exchange by the Nymex, but the 200 Comex options-trading members would receive no compensation, the suit alleges.
The Comex option members seek assurances that their trading privileges remain intact in the merger plan and that they be compensated for any loss of value of their memberships.
A spokeswoman for Nymex and Comex wasn't immediately available for comment.
