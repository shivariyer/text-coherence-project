Dime Savings Bank of New York said it completed the previously announced sale of $324 million of nonperforming mortgages and residential real estate, netting about $265 million.
Dime said the impact from the sale was included in its 1993 earnings report.
The assets were purchased by two Wall Street investment firms that Dime declined to identify.
