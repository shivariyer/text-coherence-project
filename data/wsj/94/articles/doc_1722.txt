Computervision Corp. won a strategically critical $21.4 million sale of its computer-design software and services to Rolls Royce Aerospace Group, of England.
Computervision of Bedford, Mass., struggling to remake itself as a software and services company after shedding its manufacturing operations and more than half its work force, has faced stiff competition from smaller software makers unburdened by computer hardware businesses.
Computervision said the agreement with the Rolls-Royce PLC unit is for an initial 1,000 copies of its latest computer-aided design software package and other services.
The order could lead to another 1,000 copies and as much as $60 million over seven years, it said.
"This is a huge shot in the arm for Computervision," said David Burdick, who follows the industry for market researcher Gartner Group Inc., Stamford, Conn.
Computervision's software and consulting-services revenue was $296 million last year.
