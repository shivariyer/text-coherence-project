Penn Central Corp. said it will change its name to American Premier Underwriters Inc., effective March 25.
The Cincinnati company said its name no longer relates to its current business activities, which are almost entirely in property and casualty insurance.
The corporate name change will not affect the company's insurance operating units, which will continue to operate under their own names, Penn Central said.
Also, effective March 28, Penn Central's common stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PC, will begin trading under a new symbol which has not yet been determined.
