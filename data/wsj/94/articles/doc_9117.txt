Belden & Blake Corp. said it purchased "substantially all" of TGX Corp.'s New York and Ohio assets for $15.5 million.
Belden said the transaction was effective Dec. 1, 1993.
TGX is an oil and gas exploration company based in Houston.
Belden, North Canton, Ohio, said the assets acquired include an average working interest of 88% in 1,034 oil and gas wells on about 121,000 leasehold acres in northeastern Ohio and southwestern New York; about 15,000 undeveloped leasehold acres in the proximity of the existing production; and related production equipment and supplies.
The company also said TGX has retained the right to participate in the development of the undeveloped acreage.
Belden acquires, produces and develops oil and gas properties and gathers and markets natural gas in the Appalachian Basin.
