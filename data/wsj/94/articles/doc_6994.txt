For weeks, the Clinton administration has implored Japanese political leaders to save stalled trade talks by arm-twisting their country's intransigent bureaucrat-negotiators.
Washington may be disappointed.
"Numerical targets are like managed trade and government involvement in the private sector," Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said yesterday, attacking the core U.S. demand in the so-called framework negotiations.
Mr. Hata's remarks came just hours before U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor landed in Tokyo for emergency talks with Mr. Hata and other leaders.
The two countries have less than two weeks to reach an agreement before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets President Clinton in Washington.
Since taking office six months ago, Mr. Hosokawa and his cabinet have been unusually frank about their need to curb bureaucratic power.
That has encouraged U.S. officials to try to take advantage of those apparent divisions.
But so far at least, Japan's politicians haven't shown any sign of siding with the U.S. against Japan's mandarins.
Indeed, Mr. Hata argued yesterday that U.S. demands -- such as government agreements setting goals to increase foreign autoparts sales in Japan -- contradict Mr. Hosokawa's pledge to reduce government involvement in the economy.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman dismissed Mr. Hata's remarks as "rhetoric" and "public relations."
