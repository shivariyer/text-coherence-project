The European Union Commission cleared the petrochemical merger of Finland's Neste Oy and Norway's Den Norske Stats Oljeselskab, known as Statoil.
The EU commission said that although Neste and Statoil are important operators on the petrochemical market, their combined market share of the olefin and polyolefin markets, most affected by the linkup, won't be more than 15%.
