USX Corp.
Chairman Charles A. Corry's annual compensation jumped 50% in 1993 to $1.7 million from $1.1 million in 1992, largely because he received a bigger bonus.
Mr. Corry's bonus last year was $750,000, up from $215,000 in 1992.
His salary last year was $946,667, compared with $903,750 in 1992.
And Mr. Corry, who also is chief executive of the oil, steel and natural gas concern, was awarded 200,000 options and stock appreciation rights, compared with 80,000 a year earlier.
In its proxy statement, USX said Mr. Corry's higher bonus was mainly a result of the more than $600 million improvement in profit from operations, excluding charges from inventory market valuations and major litigation accruals, in 1993 compared with 1992.
Meanwhile, Thomas J. Usher, president of USX's U.S. Steel Group, saw his annual compensation more than double to $870,000 from $425,000 in 1992.
Like Mr. Corry, Mr. Usher's compensation increase came on the strength of his bonus.
Last year, his bonus was $385,000; he received no bonus in 1992.
The company's proxy statement said Mr. Usher's bonus reflected U.S. Steel's performance, which had "the greatest improvement in profit from operations and cash flow over 1992" in the company.
