The board of Centex Telemanagement Inc. unanimously rejected a hostile $161 million cash bid from MFS Communications Co. of Omaha, Neb., as "inadequate," Centex said.
The telecommunications-management consulting company also disclosed that "third parties" have offered to buy Centex since the MFS bid.
A spokesman declined to name these other bidders, or whether the bids were higher or lower than the one from MFS, a fiber-optic telephone service company.
To protect itself from a hostile takeover, Centex extended a shareholder-rights plan and retained the services of Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. "to explore alternatives available to maximize shareholder value," Centex said in a statement.
Centex said it rejected MFS's $9-a-share bid "after careful consideration," because the bid is "not in the best interests of Centex and its stockholders."
But the board's rejection is just a recommendation to shareholders, who may tender their shares if they wish.
Centex has about 17.9 million shares outstanding.
More than 12 million of those shares have traded hands since MFS launched its bid March 16, so it is unclear who the company's largest holders are.
Josh Howell, a senior vice president at MFS, said, "We are confident after Centex weighs the alternatives, they will recognize that a combination with us will maximize value for all parties involved."
MFS has said that aquiring Centex would bolster the services of its Intelenet unit, which operates in 21 cities where Centex also operates.
MFS provides fiberoptic transmission services to about 800 businesses.
Centex helps firms pick and manage telecommunications equipment and services, and has 11,000 clients.
Since MFS announced its bid, Centex's stock has more than doubled, closing Friday at $10.50 a share, unchanged, on the Nasdaq Stock Market, up from its close of $4.875 on March 15.
