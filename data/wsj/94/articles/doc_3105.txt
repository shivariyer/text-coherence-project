Chances that Russia might yet tackle a root cause of its high inflation and economic vertigo look slightly brighter after the first public criticism by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko.
Responding at a government meeting to a statement by Mr. Gerashchenko that inflationary subsidies are a "lesser evil" than unemployment and falling production, Mr. Chernomyrdin said that shoveling out rubles weakens the Russian state.
He added: "It would make sense if Mr. Gerashchenko said what he said today a year ago," but no longer.
Russian inflation reached about 1,000% in 1993, and has recently been varying between about 15% and 25% per month.
Mr. Chernomyrdin echoed for the first time the concerns of bankers and businessmen since Mr. Gerashchenko took charge of the Central Bank in July 1992.
He said the bank has been "inadmissibly sluggish" in creating a reliable and fast system for clearing interbank transactions.
For example, despite efforts of Western advisers these past two years to provide technical help, the Central Bank has yet to sanction a system of personal checks.
Making payments still entails either hauling around bundles of cash, or going through foreign banks outside Russia.
While the main mission of central banks in capitalist economies is to defend the stability of the national currency, Mr. Gerashchenko -- who also served as Central Bank chairman under President Mikhail Gorbachev -- has taken it as his chief mission to try to prop up unprofitable production with cheap credit.
Despite Mr. Chernomyrdin's criticism, it's no sure thing that Mr. Gerashchenko will lose his job, or that the bank will respond by quickly reforming itself.
But, the main reason to take Mr. Chernomyrdin's attack as a sign that Mr. Gerashchenko's political star may finally be falling is that Mr. Chernomyrdin has long been named by most economic experts here as Mr. Gerashchenko's biggest backer in the Russian government.
