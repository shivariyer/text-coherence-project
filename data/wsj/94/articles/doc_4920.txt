Norway's Johann Olav Koss set his second world record in as many races to become the first double-gold medalist of the Olympics with a victory in the men's 1,500 meters.
The 1992 Olympic 1,500 champion, Mr. Koss finished in 1 minute, 51.29 seconds, 0.31 second better than the record set six weeks ago on the same rink by Rintje Ritsma of the Netherlands.
Mr. Koss, who broke his own world mark in Sunday's 5,000, had a blistering finish yesterday, skating his final lap in 29.38 seconds.
Skating four pairs after Mr. Koss, Mr. Ritsma was on a world record pace until the final lap and he was gasping for air coming down the final straightaway.
He won the silver in 1:51.99.
Falko Zandstra of the Netherlands finished third.
Mr. Koss, 25, also is the world record holder in the 10,000 meters, which is scheduled for Sunday.
Norway's Stine Lise Hattestad captured the women's freestyle moguls title from favored Donna Weinbrecht, who finished seventh.
But one of Ms. Weinbrecht's U.S. teammates, Liz McIntyre, took the silver medal.
Ms. Hattestad sped down the moguls course in 29.51 seconds to post the best points score, 25.97.
Ms. McIntyre had the best qualifying score and went last yesterday, but was slower than the Norwegian and ended with 25.89 points.
Russia's Elizaveta Kojevnikova won the bronze with a score of 25.81 after posting the fastest time, 29 seconds.
The big surprise was the poor performance by Ms. Weinbrecht, the 1992 gold medalist who won six World Cup races in a row this season.
Ms. Weinbrecht was beaten by Ms. Hattestad in the World Cup race at Hundfjellet, Sweden, just before the Olympics.
In the men's competition, Jean-Luc Brassard earned Canada's first gold medal of the Games.
Sergei Shoupletsov of Russia finished second, and defending champion Edgar Grospiron of France was third.
Gerda Weissensteiner of Italy captured the women's luge title by a dominating seven-tenths of a second.
She led from start to finish.
Ms. Weissensteiner finished her four runs in 3 minutes, 15.517 seconds -- well ahead of silver medalist Susi Erdmann of Germany, who finished in 3:16.276.
Andrea Tagwerker of Austria won the bronze in 3:16.652.
The Russian hockey team beat up on Austria's, 9-1, breaking the game open with seven goals in the second period.
Russia is 2-1, while Austria is winless in three games.
Finland, 3-0, clinched a spot in the quarterfinals with a 4-0 shutout over winless Norway.
And Germany fell to 2-1 with a 1-0 loss to the Czech Republic, which also has a record of 2-1.
