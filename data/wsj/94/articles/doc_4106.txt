An Indonesian court found a student dissident guilty of insulting President Suharto and sentenced him to four years in jail.
Nuku Suleiman, 29 years old, had been charged with putting up stickers last November that called Mr. Suharto the "mastermind of all disasters."
The stickers cited several incidents, including the killing of pro-independence protesters in East Timor in 1991.
Prosecutors sought the maximum six-year sentence allowed by Indonesian law.
Announcing the four-year term, the court said Mr. Nuku is young and "still has the chance to be corrected."
Hundreds of students came to hear the verdict at the heavily guarded court.
Mr. Nuku's lawyers stayed away in protest because the court didn't let them call certain witnesses.
In a written statement appealing the verdict, Mr. Nuku said the trial was unfair and state-arranged "political theater."
He said he still would "fight against personal power" and campaign to get a new president.
In December, authorities arrested 21 other students who also face trial on charges of insulting Mr. Suharto.
