Sonem Partners Ltd., a Colorado shareholder of Fibreboard Corp., filed suit in Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to enjoin the company from exercising an antitakeover "poison pill" provision.
Executives of the company, which makes building products and owns ski resorts, couldn't be reached for comment on the suit.
Fibreboard, Walnut Creek, Calif., last week announced that it rejected an unsolicited offer by investor Carl Pohlad to purchase the company for $42.50 a share.
