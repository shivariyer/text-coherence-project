Certainly American, and more precisely White House, inaction to the wholesale destruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina may be telling us disturbing things about ourselves we would rather not admit ("Americans' Inaction on Bosnia Stirs Critics to Debate and Despair," page one, March 18).
But it is simply wrong to suggest nothing was done because the victims are Muslim, as Susan Sontag stated.
More than three years ago, several hundred miles north of Sarajevo, another city was surrounded by Serbian gunners.
The city was Vukovar, a Croation (Christian) city of about 50,000.
Thousands of "Christian" civilians were massacred and the city, reduced to rubble, was captured by marauding Serbs.
Not only did Croatian towns and cities (such as Dubrovnik, known to many jet-set Americans) get no American aid, they did not even get American sympathy, as did Bosnia.
Where were Susan Sontag and the intellectuals then?
There was no American Committee to Save Croatia.
Today, 5,000 people from Vukovar remain missing and the world is silent.
There is only one thing worse than inaction in the face of genocide and that is inaction and silence.
