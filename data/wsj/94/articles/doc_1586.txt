Norcen Energy Resources Ltd. said it has applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the voluntary delisting of its common shares on the American Stock Exchange.
The company said the move is mainly due to the low volume of trading in its shares on the Amex.
Norcen said April 5 will be the last day of trading.
