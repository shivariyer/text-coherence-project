A Swiss investigating judge said he plans to charge the former chairman of French state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais SA, Jean-Yves Habererm, and a current executive, Francois Gille, in connection with the bankruptcy of Sasea Holding SA, the Swiss holding company, an attorney for Credit Lyonnais confirmed.
However, the attorney said, the Swiss judge must find a corresponding French judge to serve the two with the charges, since he has no jurisdiction in France.
Dominique Poncet of Poncet Turrettini Amaudruz & Neyroud said in a phone interview from Geneva that Judge Jean Louis Crochet won't allow Credit Lyonnais to become a plaintiff in the affair and instead wants to charge the two men in connection with what he considers to be Credit Lyonnais's role in the bankruptcy of Sasea.
Mr. Poncet said the judge has "an idea" that Credit Lyonnais, which had a total of 4.76 billion French francs ($811.3 million) of exposure to Sasea and its affiliates, was a de facto manager of Sasea, a charge Credit Lyonnais contests.
Credit Lyonnais has said it considers itself a victim of fraud in the tangled tale of Sasea.
Sasea's former chairman, Florio Fiorini, who is in jail in Switzerland, was a partner of Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian waiter-turned-financier who sought to take over Hollywood studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer with the help of loans from Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland loans.
Credit Lyonnais now controls the studio.
