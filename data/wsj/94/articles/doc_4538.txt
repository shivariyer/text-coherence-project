President Clinton has decided to name the Pentagon's top lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, to the No. 2 position in the Justice Department.
The announcement is expected to come today.
If the Senate confirms her nomination as deputy attorney general, Ms. Gorelick will succeed Philip Heymann, who resigned last month, citing a clash of administrative styles with Attorney General Janet Reno.
As the Defense Department's general counsel, Ms. Gorelick helped draft policies such as the Pentagon's directive on gays in the military.
She is expected to bring strong managerial skills to a department that critics say has been unorganized.
As deputy attorney general, the 43-year-old Harvard Law School graduate would oversee the criminal activities division, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Yesterday, the Senate confirmed President Clinton's nomination of Strobe Talbott to be deputy secretary of state.
The vote was 66-31.
Conservatives and others opposed Mr. Talbott largely over his views on Israel and Russia.
