The top securities regulators in the U.S. and Britain agreed on a set of goals for improving oversight of over-the-counter derivatives.
The agreement, signed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the British Securities and Investment Board, allows the agencies to share information about securities and futures firms using OTC derivatives.
Derivatives, which include swaps, options and futures contracts, are specialized securities whose value derives from underlying securities.
Derivatives can be traded on exchanges or over the counter.
OTC transactions are negotiated between two or more parties and tailored to fit the parties' particular hedging needs.
The agreement among the U.S. and British regulators is intended to allay concerns about the growing derivatives market and its potential impact on the traditional securities market.
Andrew Large, chairman of the British securities board, said, "OTC derivatives business has become a vital part of financial and commercial life.
Securities and futures regulators need to be confident that the risks involved are being adequately addressed.
"At the same time," Mr. Large said, "we don't want to stifle innovation or to overregulate professional markets."
Among other things, the agreement calls for the three agencies to seek common standards for net capital and management at firms trading in OTC derivatives.
The agencies also said they will encourage the development of accounting standards for derivatives so that they can be recognized on the balance sheets of securities and futures firms.
