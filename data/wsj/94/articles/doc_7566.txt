Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., hurt by its big exposure to Europe's depressed economy and by negative currency translation, reported a slight decline in fourth-quarter earnings.
Disclosure of the disappointing results sent 3M shares -- a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- down $4.125, to $106.875.
The St. Paul, Minn., industrial-products company's net dipped 1%, to $286 million, or $1.33 a share, from the year-earlier $289 million, or $1.32 a share.
The drop came despite a moderate 3.2% increase in sales, to $3.48 billion, from $3.38 billion.
Per-share results reflect a decline in the number of shares outstanding.
The results were helped by "good volume growth and productivity improvements," said L.D. DeSimone, 3M's chairman and chief executive officer.
