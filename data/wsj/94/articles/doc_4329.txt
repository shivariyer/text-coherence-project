Cablevision Systems Corp. reported a larger net loss and a 21% decline in operating cash flow for the fourth quarter because of a one-time charge.
The cable-television company, based in Woodbury, N.Y., said it had a loss of $86.9 million, or $3.78 a share, compared with a loss of $65.9 million, or $2.94 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 9% to $172 million.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter dropped to $52.6 million from $66.4 million, largely on a $15.5 million noncash charge associated with an incentive stock plan.
Without the charge, Cablevision said operating cash flow would have increased by less than 1% in the fourth quarter, with FCC rate regulation.
For the full year, Cablevision posted a loss of $246.8 million, or $10.83 a share, compared with a loss of $250.5 million, or $11.17 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 16% to $666.7 million, and operating cash flow increased 2% to $252.2 million.
