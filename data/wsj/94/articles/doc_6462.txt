Canada's unemployment rate rose to 11.4% of the civilian labor force in January from 11.2% in December, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
Finance Minister Paul Martin attributed the increase partly to a temporary shutdown of some auto plants for retooling for new models.
He said the January figure shows "the absolute necessity of getting on with giving this economy the capacity to create jobs."
