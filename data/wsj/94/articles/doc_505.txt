Intel Corp., staking claim in China's fast-growing market for personal computers, said it has agreed to let a Chinese manufacturer perform final assembly on unfinished computer chips.
Under the agreement to be announced today in Beijing, Intel, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant, will contract with Huajing Electronics Group, a unit of the China Electronics Corp., to test and assemble Intel 386 SX microprocessors delivered in wafer form.
In return, China Electronics is to advocate Intel as the PC chip of choice in China, where personal computers are beginning to proliferate in government and schools.
Several U.S.-based PC companies are increasing their presence in China, including AST Research Inc., Irvine, Calif., China's market leader in PC sales.
