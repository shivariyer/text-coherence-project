Hewlett-Packard Co. is expected to introduce a new line of ink-jet printers this week, continuing its strategy of rapid-fire product introductions to keep its commanding share of the personal-computer printer market.
The Palo Alto, Calif., computer concern, which dominates the fast-growing market for ink-jet printers, plans to replace its existing line with printers that offer printing resolution of 600 dots an inch, twice the resolution of its existing ink-jet models.
A new color version will also include software that H-P says will provide more accurate color printing.
A monochrome version of the new printer, the DeskJet 520, will list for $365, the same price as the model it replaces, the DeskJet 500.
A color version, the DeskJet 560C will list for $716 and will replace H-P's DeskJet 550C.
Both printers will be available in versions that work with Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computers.
H-P also plans to cut the list price of one of its existing color printers for the Macintosh, the DeskWriter 550C, to $599 from $719.
