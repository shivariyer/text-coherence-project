The Defense Department is preparing to ban smoking in all military workplaces.
The ban, which is scheduled to be announced today, will apply to roughly four million people, according to Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood.
Those affected include military personnel and any civilian government officials, foreign nationals or employees of private contractors who work at any military facility in the U.S. or abroad.
The ban is expected to take effect within 30 days, and will apply to military activities on bases and in other buildings owned or leased by the military.
Its applicability to workplaces on ships and in planes and helicopters, where smoking already is strictly curtailed, remains unclear.
Certain areas not defined as workplaces would be unaffected by the ban.
"You can still smoke in barracks, and you can still smoke in family housing," Mr. Flood said.
Dining areas and officers' clubs currently have designated nonsmoking areas, he said, and that arrangement is likely to continue.
