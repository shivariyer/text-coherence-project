D.R. Horton Inc. said net sales contracts signed in January rose 72% from a year earlier, to $32.5 million, or 212 homes, the highest monthly sales in the company's history, from $18.9 million, or 122 homes.
Donald R. Horton, chairman and president of the home-building concern, said the company's strategy of diversifying geographically helped new-home sales rise despite severe winter weather.
The company's markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and Western regions of the U.S. Mr. Horton said the company is "confident 1994 will mark another year of record earnings at D.R. Horton."
