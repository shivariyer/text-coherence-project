The American Stock Exchange, as expected, named Richard F. Syron, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston president, as its new chairman.
Mr. Syron, 50 years old, succeeds James R. Jones, who left the exchange last summer to become U.S. ambassador to Mexico.
Mr. Syron will assume office April 1.
According to people close to the search, Mr. Syron will receive cash compensation of about $1 million.
Mr. Syron's salary at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, where he has been president since January 1989, is $177,600.
Mr. Syron said one of his goals as chairman will be to do a better job of informing investors and companies of the advantage of an auction market, rather than a dealer market, such as the Nasdaq Stock Market.
In recent years, Amex has been hurt because many of the small and medium-size companies that are potential candidates for listing on the American exchange instead have gone to Nasdaq.
Mr. Syron said he thinks the derivatives business is a niche that the exchange can expand upon.
Derivatives are hybrid securities based on an underlying stock index or commodity.
In Washington, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the Fed "will miss especially his thoughtful insights to monetary policy."
A new president of the Boston Fed will be chosen by the bank's private-sector directors, subject to approval of the Fed board.
