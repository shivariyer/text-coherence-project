The House Democratic leadership, breaking with tradition, reached over lawmakers with more seniority to select Wisconsin Rep. David Obey as the next chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
The action, which still must be ratified by the full Democratic caucus tomorrow, opens the door to landmark change in an often insular committee with immense power over federal spending and President Clinton's investment agenda.
The 55-year-old Mr. Obey won handily in a closed-door session of the leadership's steering and policy committee.
When vote-counting was cut off because he had achieved a majority, he had a better than 2-1 lead over his more senior rival, Rep. Neal Smith of Iowa.
Mr. Smith can contest the decision in the full caucus, but Mr. Obey's victory was a bitter setback for the the Iowan, who celebrates his 74th birthday tomorrow.
The victor will have the title "associate chairman," in deference to the panel's ailing chairman, William Natcher (D., Ky.).
But given Mr. Natcher's condition and age, 84, the voting this week is tantamount to the selection of a new chairman for at least the remainder of this Congress.
