Small-company stocks again showed resilience, bouncing off midday lows to end the session only slightly lower.
The major small-capitalization indexes posted marginal declines.
Traders and analysts said the outlook for a strong economy and continued strong earnings reports are overpowering fears of a resurgence in inflation or a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-capitalization stocks traded on the major exchanges and over the counter, was down 0.05 at 267.57, having traded as low as 266.59 earlier.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.78, or 0.22%, to 797.79, off its low of 794.75, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index, at 267.18, slipped 0.53, or 0.20%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 7.88, or 0.20%, at 3967.66.
On Nasdaq, decliners slightly outnumbered advancers, 1,595 to 1,437, on total volume of 331.6 million shares, up from 334.9 million shares Wednesday.
National Market volume was 277 million shares, compared with 284 million Wednesday.
Despite the lingering threat of higher interest rates, the small-company market continues to be a pick-and-choose arena in which news and company fundamentals tend to overpower marketwide trends.
Small computer-technology companies generally ended lower, but IEC Electronics, a Newark, N.Y., company that makes complex printed circuit board assemblies and electronic systems, rose 1 1/2, or 9.2%, to 17 3/4.
The rise comes on the heels of Raymond James's initiation of coverage with a "buy" rating.
Raymond James predicted IEC, whose largest customer is Compaq Computer, will show net-income growth of 43% and 19% in fiscal 1994 and 1995, respectively.
Retailing issues also showed a marked tendency to react to news.
Gottschalks, which operates a chain of department stores, was up 1 1/4, or 15%, to 9 1/2 in New York Stock Exchange trading after reporting that January same-store sales rose 10.5% from a year earlier.
The Fresno, Calif., retailer said it expects a "strong and profitable fourth quarter."
Payless Cashways rose 1 3/4, or 9.9%, to 19 3/8 in Big Board trading.
The Kansas City, Mo., chain of building-supply stores reported a 10.8% increase in January same-store sales.
Chico's FAS, a Fort Myers, Fla., clothing store operator, plunged 3, or 19%, to 12 3/4 after its stock was downgraded by Raymond James to "hold" from "buy."
Loan America Financial, a Miami Lakes, Fla., mortgage-banking servicer, was up 2, or 18%, at 13 after saying it might be bought by a financial institution that wasn't identified.
Cyrix, a Richardson, Texas, microprocessor firm, was up 3 1/8, or 14%, at 26 1/8 following an announcement late Wednesday that the company and Intel settled various issues in their legal battle over Cyrix's right to sell computer chips that are clones of Intel's chips.
Komag, a Milpitas, Calif., maker of thin-film components for disk drives, rose 3 1/2, or 17%, to 23 5/8.

The Los Angeles air cargo company reported second-quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, up from 16 cents a year ago.
One of the day's biggest decliners was 4th Dimension Software, of Tel Aviv, which fell 7 5/8, or 40%, to 11 1/2.
The company late Wednesday reported fourth-quarter earnings of three cents a share, compared with 16 cents a year earlier.
Kulicke & Soffa, a Willow Grove, Pa., semiconductor company, dropped 3 1/8, or 21%, to 11 3/4 after it reported fiscal first-quarter earnings of 28 cents a share.
That was above last year's six cents but well below analysts' expectations of 39 cents.
Ventritex fell 4, or 10%, to 35 1/2 after Hambrecht & Quist downgraded the Sunnyvale, Calif., company to "underperform" from "buy."
"People keep expecting the market to tank, but it just won't cooperate with the bears," said William Sulya, head of over-the-counter trading at A.G. Edwards.
Small-company stocks fell early on a wave of profit-taking and weakness in the bond market.
But after midday, "we bounced back very smartly," Mr. Sulya said.
"The buyers came out of the walls."
He said one of the strengths of the smallcap market is that "it's not running away on the upside.
It's picking away.
It's a controlled situation."
