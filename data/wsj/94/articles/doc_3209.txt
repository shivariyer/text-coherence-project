A group of video-game makers representing most of the industry said it will devise a voluntary ratings system labeling new products according to the level of sex and violence in time for this year's holiday buying season.
The proposal from the Interactive Entertainment Industry Ratings Systems Committee comes as lawmakers in Washington -- increasingly troubled by the proliferation of gory acts and suggestive themes -- prepare to introduce legislation that would make ratings mandatory.
Some retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Babbage's Inc. promised to carry only rated video games.
But some critics fear all the ratings would do is whet the appetites of teenagers.
While some industry watchers said they are pleased with the self-policing plan, critics continue to call for an outside agency to monitor the games.
"You don't put the monkeys in charge of the zoo," said Marilyn Droz, vice president of the National Coalition on Television Violence.
NCTV and other groups prefer an independent ratings agency to curb the sex and violence in video games and not just label them, she said.
Under the committee's plan, products coming to market after Nov. 1 will be rated roughly according to guidelines used by the movie industry.
Games deemed suitable for all ages will be labeled GA, for general audience.
Fare for children 13 and older will be labeled MA-13, and an MA-17 label will be for material suitable for players 17 and older.
Ratings would be given only to the new crop-about 2,500 video games annually -- but not to the 5,000 games already on the market, said Jack Heistand, chairman of the committee.
