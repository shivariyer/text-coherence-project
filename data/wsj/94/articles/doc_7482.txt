Thermo Cardiosystems Inc., in the early stages of marketing its heart-pump device, expects fourth-quarter net income of about $160,000, or one cent a share, on $1.1 million in revenue.
Victor Poirier, chief executive officer, said results were aided by growing use of its HeartMate left ventricular-assist device.
It is now sold abroad and has been recommended for approval for U.S. sale.
In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Thermo Cardiosystems had a net loss of $24,000 on revenue of $581,000.
Since then, its stock has split 2 for 1.
For the full year, Mr. Poirier said, Thermo Cardiosystems expects to report net income of about $405,000, or two cents a share, up from net of $18,000 in 1992.
Revenue grew to $3.5 million from $2.4 million.
Mr. Poirier said he expects Thermo Cardiosystems this year to double net income and revenue.
The company expects total HeartMate implants this year of 200 to 300, up from last year's 80.
The device pumps blood to assist weak hearts.
In December, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel recommended FDA approval of HeartMate for severely ill cardiac patients awaiting heart transplants.
There are about 2,000 transplants annually.
Mr. Poirier said he expects final FDA approval by July.
The unit, which costs about $30,000, is surgically implanted and powered by a portable, briefcase-sized air compressor that remains outside the body.
Mr. Poirier said a smaller, battery-powered version is planned.
Meanwhile, Mr. Poirier said the FDA has cleared HeartMate for shipment to 14 foreign countries.
In seven, including Britain, France, Italy, Sweden, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands, it may be sold commercially, he said.
Mr. Poirier said that ultimately Thermo Cardiosystems hopes to sell HeartMate to the 200,000 people in the U.S. who "are in a slow, debilitating process when their heart has lost the ability to pump normally."
