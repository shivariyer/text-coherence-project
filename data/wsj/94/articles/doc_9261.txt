Hasbro Inc. said it expects to report fourth-quarter net income of about 75 cents a share after taking a one-time $15 million charge, or nine cents a share, as a result of closing one of its plants in the Netherlands.
That compares with earnings of 73 cents a share for the 1992 fourth quarter.
The Pawtucket, R.I., toy maker also said it expects to report its fourth-quarter revenue climbed more than 10% from 1992 fourth-quarter revenue of $831.3 million.
The company said it decided to close the Netherlands facility, which employs 162 people, to consolidate its European operations.
Jill Krutick, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst, said the plant closure should generate savings for Hasbro by the end of 1995.
