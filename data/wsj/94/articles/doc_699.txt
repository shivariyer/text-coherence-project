Rogers Communications Inc. said it won't take up any shares of Maclean Hunter Ltd. before March 31, under Rogers' bid for Maclean Hunter's shares.
A Rogers spokeswoman said Maclean Hunter shareholders are "holding back" on depositing their Maclean Hunter shares under the bid, because they're uncertain that they will receive a Maclean Hunter dividend of 6.25 Canadian cents (US4.55 cents).
The dividend is payable to shareholders of record March 31.
Rogers previously had the right to take up deposited shares at any time.
By not taking up any shares until March 31, Rogers is ensuring that all Maclean Hunter shareholders will receive the dividend, the spokeswoman said.
Rogers, a Toronto telecommunications and cable television concern, is making a C$2.79 billion (US$2.03 billion) bid for the shares of Maclean Hunter, a Toronto cable television and publishing concern.
The bid expires March 31.
