Merisel Inc. said it completed its acquisition of ComputerLand Corp.'s franchise and distribution operation in a transaction valued at as much as $110 million.
Merisel, an El Segundo, Calif., distributor of microcomputer hardware and software products to computer resellers, said it paid about $80 million in cash for the operation, of which $20 million will be converted to Merisel common stock at a price of $18.13 a share.
Merisel, which announced the proposed transaction in September, said it could pay as much as $30 million more based on future revenue and other factors.
The operation ComputerLand sold to Merisel has accounted for roughly half of ComputerLand's revenue.
The closely held company, based in Pleasanton, Calif., sold the business to raise money and because the company wants to focus on servicing its largest accounts.
Merisel now gets the rights to the ComputerLand name in the U.S. ComputerLand said it will announce a new name in March, but retains the rights to the ComputerLand name abroad.
