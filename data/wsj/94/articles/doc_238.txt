Charter Medical Corp. said it agreed to purchase 46 psychiatric hospitals and one outpatient facility from National Medical Enterprises Inc. for $152 million.
The transaction, which was expected, also involves the acquisition by Charter Medical of approximately $48 million in working capital, most of which is accounts receivable that Charter Medical expects to recover in full.
National Medical had been negotiating to sell the hospitals to Charter Medical, of Macon, Ga., following a spate of problems at the facilities.
National Medical, based in Santa Monica, Calif., paid hundreds of millions of dollars to several insurance companies last year to settle charges of billing fraud and mistreatment of patients.
The acquisition, which Charter Medical expects to be substantially completed by May 31, expands Charter Medical's reach by five states.
It has current operations in 26 states and two foreign countries.
