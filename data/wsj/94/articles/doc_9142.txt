As EPA's Superfund manager from 1985 to 1989, I read Tim Noah's Dec. 2 Politics & Policy article with interest.
He describes well the competing interests attempting to fix Superfund.
All the old favorite issues are there: "How clean is clean," excessive costs, retroactivity, insurance and liability.
Rather than debate all this fine-tuning of an ill-conceived statute, let me propose a better approach.
Turn Superfund over to the states.
Every day, the states are proving they can clean up sites faster, and at lower cost, than the federal Superfund program.
The typical federal cleanup takes 10 years and costs about $30 million.
By contrast, Minnesota cleanups take two to three years and average less than $5 million.
Wisconsin already has cleaned up 227 sites, more than the entire federal program.
New York has completed about 140 sites.
The reasons are increasingly apparent.
The states are much closer to the site problems and land-use issues.
The federal program is built on "national consistency" in site remedies, which ignores the fact that each site is a unique local problem.
Sites differ widely in terms of pollutants involved, hydrology and geology, site area (acres to square miles), and land-use patterns.
Another complication is the cottage industry financed by taxpayers to micromanage Superfund.
EPA funds almost 100 people in the inspector general's office to find fraud, waste and abuse -- which, of course, they always do.
Congress has tasked an alphabet soup of agencies to fine-tune every aspect of Superfund.
Operating away from the glare of this national spotlight has allowed the states to quietly clean up their sites.
EPA, on the other hand, spends most of its time defending the program before Rep. Dingell, Sen. Lautenberg and others.
EPA should set minimum standards for state programs, but without demanding exact "consistency," and should maintain its lead in cleaning up federal facilities.
Otherwise, the states should take over.
