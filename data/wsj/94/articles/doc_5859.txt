Small-company stocks showed widespread gains, with major indexes again approaching record levels.
Traders said investors continue to focus on specific news about companies rather than on concern about rising interest rates.
After the Federal Reserve Friday tightened monetary policy a notch late last week, "We had a quick and dirty correction.
But now, we're right back in it," said Brett Discher, vice president of equity trading at Dain Bosworth.
The rise in rates, "was more psychological than a meaningful event," he said.
"Rates aren't high enough for people to flood into interest-rate instruments."
The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 1.83, or 0.69%, to 265.22, about 2 1/2 points shy of its record.

America West Airlines plunged 27/32, or 30%, to 2 3/8 after CNBC correspondent Dan Dorfman reported that a money manager said the Phoenix-based airline's equity may be worth little, if anything.
The company has been operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since June 1991.
Money manager Steve Macklem, of Arauca Partners, whom Mr. Dorfman noted has a significant short position in America West, told Mr. Dorfman that if a proposal by New York money manager Michael Steinhardt to pump $250 million into the company -- and acquire 80% control -- goes through, "current shares will be canceled and the public would be left with paper it could hang on the bathroom walls."

Scott Bleier, vice president of technical research at Josephthal Lyons & Ross, said that prior to the Fed's tightening there had been a widespread perception that the first uptick in rates would lead to a major correction and consolidation of stock prices.
But he said the ability of the market to shrug off the rate increase and to push back toward record levels shows that the market is still "in transition from an interest-rate driven market to an economy-driven market."
But Mr. Bleier was quick to add, "From a technical perspective, we're not out of the woods yet."
He said that before the market can break into virgin territory, it will have to test the lows hit late last week.
The market, he said, "can't go up without a break."
Moreover, he expects investors to show "continued caution because of the new interest-rate structure."
Mr. Bleier looks for the market to test its recent lows before the end of the quarter.
But that test will only serve as a temporary setback, he said.
"The bull market is not over."
