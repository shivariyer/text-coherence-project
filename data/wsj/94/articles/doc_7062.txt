AlliedSignal Inc. and Sextant Avionique broke off talks on a joint venture in avionics, saying they couldn't find a way to integrate their avionics businesses.
When the companies announced plans to merge their avionics operations last August, analysts said increasing competition in the industry necessitated such a merger.
Still, some aerospace experts questioned the planned merger, saying the corporate cultures of the two companies clashed.
But AlliedSignal said merger talks unraveled because the two companies couldn't agree on how to incorporate Sextant's military operations.
The joint venture would have had total sales of about $1 billion a year, the companies said.
Sextant Avionique, a French concern created in 1989, produces electronics and computers for aircraft.
AlliedSignal, based in Morris Township, N.J., makes aerospace and automotive products and engineered materials.
