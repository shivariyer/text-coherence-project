Ten years after Congress ordered them, the Federal Highway Administration finally issued safety rules for private buses such as church vans and company-owned shuttles.
The rules will require federal maintenance inspections for the vehicles, and they will limit drivers' hours at the wheel.
They won't go into effect until next January "to allow the affected operators sufficient time to become familiar with the new rules," the agency said.
School buses are already subject to federal safety rules, as are scheduled bus lines, charter buses, and public shuttle buses that cross state lines.
That two pages of rules took a decade to write is a testament to the caution of Washington's bureaucracies.
The highway administration's deliberations included publishing several versions of proposed rules, conducting a two-year study into the operating practices of private carriers, and gathering comments each step of the way.
In 1984, Congress passed a law extending federal jurisdication to buses operated privately by businesses and by nonprofit groups such as churches and Boy Scout troops.
