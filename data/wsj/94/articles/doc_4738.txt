ASA International Ltd. said its board established a committee to evaluate ways to "maximize the value of the company for shareholders."
Among the possibilities to be considered is a proposal by ASA's chairman and chief executive, Alfred C. Angelone, and its president, Christopher J. Crane, to acquire four of ASA's software businesses, while leaving its fast-growing electronic time recording business to be the sole business of the public company.
That business has annual revenue of about $10 million, Mr. Angelone said.
Mr. Angelone said he and Mr. Crane would exchange some of their 750,000 shares each of ASA and a note for the four slower-growing units.
He declined to provide details of his offer.
Those units, which make software for freight forwarders, tire distributors, lawyers and catalog marketers, have combined revenue of about $18 million.
Mr. Angelone said the time recording line has been growing fast but its growth has been masked by problems in other areas.
He said, "we believe it is in the best interests of shareholders to separate the rapidly growing . . . line from our other divisions."
Mr. Angelone said investment bankers have advised him that investors prefer to buy stock in a fast-growing single-product company over one with both good and bad software lines.
He said he would continue to head the public company.
The independent directors committee, headed by John M. Grogan, an investment banker, will hire a financial adviser and plans to finish the evaluation by April 1.
