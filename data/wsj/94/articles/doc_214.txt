American President Cos.'s stock plunged 20% after the firm disclosed that it expects break-even operating results in the fiscal first quarter.
The Oakland, Calif., transportation concern would not provide an indication of what its net income would be for the period that ends April 8, except to say it would include $10 million of earnings from real estate sales and work related to Operation Desert Storm.
The company said a slump in its transportation business, from such factors as price competition and lower-margin cargo, would depress the operating income.
Analysts had expected net income of 42 cents to 52 cents a share in the quarter, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
In the same period a year ago, the company reported profit of $12.1 million, or 76 cents a share.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, the stock sank $6.125 to $24.
