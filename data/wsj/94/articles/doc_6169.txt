TakeCare Inc., which last month agreed in principle to be acquired by FHP International Corp., said the agreement has been terminated, and it plans to discuss mergers with other companies.
TakeCare, a health maintenance organization, signed a preliminary agreement Jan. 10 to be acquired by FHP, a Fountain Valley, Calif.-based HMO, for $829 million in cash and securities.
The merger would have created one of the nation's top three publicly traded HMOs.
However, shortly after the proposed merger was announced, TakeCare shareholders, who collectively own 22% of the company, filed suit, alleging the company's board neglected its fiduciary duties in agreeing to sell the company.
At that time, TakeCare said the suit was without merit and it was proceeding with plans to close the sale.
Yesterday, a TakeCare spokesman said there was "no connection" between the lawsuit and the company's announcement terminating its agreement with FHP.
TakeCare said FHP is still being considered as a company to merge with, but other companies have "expressed interest" since its agreement with FHP was announced.
United Healthcare Corp., of Minnetonka, Minn., "has been pursuing us" in the past, the TakeCare spokesman said, but he declined to say whom the company is talking with about a possible acquisition.
