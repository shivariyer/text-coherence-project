Insilco Corp., which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy code protection in April 1993, expects a wider fourth-quarter net loss but increased sales and cash flow, said Chief Executive Officer Robert L. Smialek.
For the fourth quarter, Insilco estimates a net loss of between $13.8 million and $14.4 million, or $1.45 to $1.55 a share.
In the year-ago period, the company reported a net loss of $11.1 million, or $1.15-a-share loss, on a comparable basis.
Mr. Smialek attributed the wider loss to reorganization costs, which include about $18.2 million in the fourth quarter for goodwill amortization.
As part of the reorganization plan, the industrial component manufacturer must write off $218 million of goodwill over three years, beginning April 1, 1993.
Excluding reorganization items, discontinued operations, and adjustments for fresh-start accounting, Insilco will report fourth-quarter earnings of $2.7 million to $3.3 million compared with $500,000 on the same basis in the year-ago period.
Sales for the three months rose 7% to about $147 million from $137 million in 1992, boosted by strong performances from Insilco's technology and metals groups, which produce the company's telecommunications cables and automotive parts.
Estimated net income for the year is about $402 million compared with a loss of $31.3 million in 1992.
Annual 1993 income excluding reorganization items, discontinued operations and adjustments for fresh-start accounting will be about $9 million to $9.2 million, down from $9.5 million a year earlier, due mostly to higher interest costs, Mr. Smialek said.
The company plans to sell several divisions by the end of the third quarter in an attempt to generate cash flow and refocus on more profitable niche industries, Mr. Smialek said.
The targeted divisions include Insilco's Rolodex office supply division, its Curtis Manufacturing division and its Sinclair Paint division.
The company, which began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market Nov. 29, 1993, had been in bankruptcy-court proceedings since Jan. 13, 1991.
