Sharp Microelectronics Technology Inc. said it will spend $30 million to expand a liquid crystal display, or LCD, facility at its Camas, Wash., headquarters.
The plant will begin producing 10,000 active-matrix color LCD units a month by October, Sharp said.
The unit of Japan-based Sharp Corp. said the expansion is needed to meet the strong demand for the LCD panels used in color laptop and notebook computers.
In addition to the production expansion, Sharp is also establishing an advanced Technology Development Center for LCD research.
The work force is expected to increase to 510 by the end of next year from 350, it said.
