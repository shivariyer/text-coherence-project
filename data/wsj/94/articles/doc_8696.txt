Two regional banks, CoreStates Financial Corp. of Philadelphia and Signet Banking Corp. of Richmond, Va., reported robust growth in fourth-quarter profits, reflecting improved credit quality and increased lending.
CoreStates reported a 23% jump in fourth-quarter net income to $85.3 million, or 73 cents a share, from $69.1 million, or 59 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
For the full year, CoreStates said net income rose 74% to $314.9 million, or $2.69 a share, after a one-time accounting charge of $13 million for postemployment benefits.
In 1992, CoreStates reported net income of $181.4 million, or $1.57 a share, after an $81 million accounting charge for health benefits for retirees.
CoreStates Chairman Terrence A. Larsen attributed the year's record earnings to broad strength in all of the bank's basic businesses.
Signet Banking said fourth-quarter net income jumped 57% to $49.9 million, or 87 cents a share, from $31.8 million, or 57 cents a share.
Profit for the year rose 60% to $174.4 million, or $3.06 a share, from $109.2 million, or $1.96 a share.
The per share data reflects a 2-for-1 stock split.

Net interest income rose 10% for the quarter and 22% for the year, the company said.
Assets were $11.8 billion as of Dec. 31.
The bank's loan loss provision declined 28% for the quarter and 30% for the year from the corresponding periods of 1992.
