Mobil Corp. said the Griffin field offshore the West Australian coast began producing.
Mobil said gross oil production is at 80,000 barrels a day, of which its share is 28,000 barrels daily.
The Fairfax, Va., company said its Mobil Exploration and Producing Australia unit has a 35% interest in the field.
The company said that after gas producing facilities are fully commissioned "in the next few months," gas production will reach 38 million cubic feet daily, making Mobil's share 13.3 million cubic feet a day.
Mobil said the Griffin field is Australia's first offshore development to commercialize natural gas produced along with crude oil.
It is operated by BHP Petroleum, a unit of Broken Hill Proprietary Co., which has a 45% interest, while Inpex of Japan holds 20%.
