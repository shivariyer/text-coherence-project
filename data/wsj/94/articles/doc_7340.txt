Texas Instruments Inc. reported a 72% jump in fourth-quarter earnings amid a continuing surge in its semiconductor business, but said it will eliminate 700 jobs in other operations.
Net income in the quarter totaled $134 million, or $1.42 a share, compared with $78 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue climbed 19% to $2.37 billion from $1.99 billion, largely reflecting gains in the chip business.
Texas Instruments predicted it will enjoy continued strong growth in semiconductors.
The company wouldn't disclose how much its chip business grew last year, but said it was greater than an estimated 30% increase in the world-wide semiconductor market.
The company projects the market will expand about 15% this year.
"We would think that we have plenty of room to gain market share" in chips, said William A. Aylesworth, the company's chief financial officer.
Not all of Texas Instruments' businesses are booming.
The company's defense electronics business, hurt by declining military spending, shrank a further 7% last year to $1.84 billion in revenue.
Mr. Aylesworth said that "a gradual decline of something like that is likely to continue."
As a result, the company said next month it will eliminate 500 of the approximately 14,000 jobs in the defense segment.
Overall, Texas Instruments employs almost 60,000 people.
The company also announced that it will cut 200 jobs in the consolidation of its unit that makes calculators with the unit that makes notebook computers and laser printers.
The two units currently employ about 2,000 people.
About half the jobs to be cut are outside the U.S.
The consolidation plan resulted in a $23 million pretax charge against fourth-quarter earnings.
The company's revenue from patent royalties jumped 33% last year to $521 million, largely because of new agreements with personal-computer makers covering Texas Instruments' computer-systems patents and increased production by companies holding licenses under Texas Instruments' semiconductor patents.
The company said the increased royalty revenue allowed it to raise spending on research and development by 26% last year to $590 million.
Texas Instruments said it expects that figure to rise to about $700 million this year.
For all of 1993, profit climbed 91% to $472 million, or $5.03 a share, from $247 million, or $2.50 a share.
Revenue was up 15% to $8.52 billion from $7.44 billion.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Texas Instruments' stock rose 12.5 cents a share to close at $71.
