Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, said it combined its U.S. Navy operations with its Department of Energy and environmental-services businesses.
The move is part of new Chairman Michael H. Jordan's plan to focus on several core businesses, which also include power generation, broadcasting, electronic systems and Thermo King, a transportation-refrigeration company.
The new unit is called Westinghouse Government & Environmental Services Co.
"The new organization will have several advantages," Mr. Jordan said.
"It will help transfer the best safety, environmental and management practices among the DOE sites we manage.
It will quicken the pace of technology transfer from DOE sites into the private sector.
And it will provide the senior management leadership necessary to further improve performance of our Navy nuclear programs."
Francis J. Harvey, 50 years old, was named president of the new unit.
He most recently was vice president of Westinghouse's Science and Technology Center.
