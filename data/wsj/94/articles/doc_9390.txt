A top executive has resigned from ailing Policy Management Systems Corp.
The insurance software concern confirmed yesterday that Bernard Mazon stepped down as executive vice president.
Mr. Mazon couldn't be reached, and Policy Management wouldn't comment on the reasons for his departure.
A successor hasn't been named.
In April, the company said its first-quarter results would be well below expectations; its share price fell 43% in response.
Since then, Policy Management's financial reporting has become the target of federal and internal investigations.
The company has reorganized several business units to keep pace with shifting markets.
The company's fast-growing Total Policy Management services will become a separate business group, run by senior vice president James Brown, 47 years old.
Stephen G. Morrison, 47, was named executive vice president and general counsel.
He is currently a partner with Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough in South Carolina.
