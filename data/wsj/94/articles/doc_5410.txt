St. Jude Medical Inc. agreed to invest $5 million in Advanced Tissue Sciences Inc. to work with the La Jolla, Calif., company on possible development of heart valves from human tissue.
Based in St. Paul, Minn., St. Jude, the nation's biggest maker of mechanical heart valves, will pay $5 million for 563,000 shares, or 1.87%, of Advanced Tissue's common stock.
The two companies will also study the feasibility of heart-valve replacements made from human tissue.
Advanced Tissue Sciences replicates human tissue by putting samples of tissue in a simulated cell-growth environment.
"We fool the cells into thinking they're in the body," said Gail K. Naughton, executive vice president.
In the agreement with St. Jude, Advanced Tissue hopes to create a fully human heart valve using living cells from the lining of blood vessels.
Currently, mechanical heart valves require patients to take anticoagulants for life.
A fully human tissue heart valve would not require anticoagulants.
