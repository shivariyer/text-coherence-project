Ford Motor Co. said its salaried and hourly workers will receive profit-sharing checks averaging $1,350 on March 9.
The payout, to about 152,000 eligible employees, will be slightly higher than 1990's average $1,025 and is the eighth profit-sharing payment for the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker.
The last time Ford distributed profit-sharing checks was in 1990, based on 1989 profit of $3.83 billion.
Chrysler Corp. said its workers will receive profit-sharing checks averaging $4,300.
General Motors Corp. said it won't pay bonuses or profit-sharing distributions to executives or workers, though it had an overall profit in 1993.
Ford's profit-sharing program is based on earnings in the U.S.
This year's payout is based on Ford's 1993 profit of $2.5 billion.
