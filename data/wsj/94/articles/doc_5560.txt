Amoco Corp. said a reorganization of its Amoco Oil Co. marketing group will result in the elimination of as many as 600 jobs.
The Chicago oil company said the move is designed to improve customer service and to cut certain costs.
Amoco Oil, the company's refining, marketing and transportation subsidiary, has 6,000 employees; the reorganization could remove 6% to 10% of those workers, an Amoco spokesman said.
"A major benefit of the organization alignment will be focused, better-defined job responsibilities," said Robert J. Rauscher, Amoco Oil's vice president for marketing.
As part of the reorganization, Amoco will shift to a brand-management approach similar to that of large consumer-product companies but rare for oil companies.
