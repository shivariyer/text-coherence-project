United Parcel Service of America Inc. estimated the daylong strike by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters will cost the company more than $50 million in lost business and added expenses.
Still digging out from a package pileup, the closely held package-delivery concern, based in Atlanta, said the Monday walkout scared away several large customers, perhaps permanently.
A spokesman said the total could reach as high as $60 million.
The Teamsters called the strike to oppose the company's new weight limit, which went to 150 pounds from 70 pounds.
The union said the heavier packages are dangerous to workers' health.
A UPS spokesman said most of the damage was from lost revenues.
UPS said it included in its calculation the cost of renting trucks, calling more than 100,000 customers to reassure them and the salaries of managers who had to deliver packages on Monday.
The figure takes into account savings from unpaid salaries for striking workers.
In the settlement, UPS said it reserves the right to hold the Teamsters international liable for the damages.
