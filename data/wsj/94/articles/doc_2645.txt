I am sickened that you chose to highlight on your Feb. 3 page one "How a Nice Girl Evolved Into Boss, the Gangster Rapper," who "muses aloud about killing someone -- anyone."
I have a wife and two very young children.
I started my business six years ago.
We are working hard to ensure the security of our family, inclusive of the values of family, faith, love, sharing and sacrifice, all for achieving the greater good.
Your highlighting of this person's disgraceful behavior has made me feel that I, and others like me, are being cut off at the feet.
