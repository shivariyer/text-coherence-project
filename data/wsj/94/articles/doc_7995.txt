President Clinton will ask Congress for $6.6 billion in emergency spending for Southern California, on top of $900 million that already has been released from contingency funds, White House Budget Director Leon Panetta said.
The money would go to rebuild highways and utility systems, assist school districts affected by the earthquake, provide vouchers to help displaced people find housing, and to pay for Federal Emergency Management Administration operations.
"This is a preliminary request, and it's based on the best estimates of damages that we have at this point," Mr. Panetta said, promising to adjust the request as new information is received.
The budget director said prompt congressional action is needed to waive a law that limits federal spending on any disaster to $100 million per state, a level he said may be reached within 10 days.
While expressing gratitude for the White House's willingness to act quickly, California Gov. Pete Wilson said the request should come with a "big warning" that the final tab could be much larger.
"I am very wary of Congress acting on this and saying, `OK, we've dealt with that crisis.
That's all there is,'" said Gov. Wilson, whose recession-wracked administration was facing a severe budget crunch even before the earthquake.
For many California manufacturers, the earthquake could worsen an already troubled situation.
Dun & Bradstreet Information Services said yesterday that it considered 52% of firms within a 40-mile radius of the earthquake's Los Angeles epicenter to be in "high-risk categories" of financial condition -- even before the disaster.
That compares to an average of between 30-35% nationwide.
"This could mean a long and troubled recovery for these businesses, if they can recover at all," said Dun & Bradstreet economist David T. Kresge.
