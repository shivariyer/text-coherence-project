Unlike open-end funds, closed-ends generally do not buy their shares back from investors who wish to cash in their holdings.
Instead, fund shares trade on a stock exchange.
The following list, provided by Lipper Analytical Services, shows the exchange where each fund trades (A: American; C: Chicago; N: NYSE; O: Nasdaq; T: Toronto; z: does not trade on an exchange).
The data also include the fund's most recent net asset value, its closing share price on the day NAV was calculated, and the percentage difference between the market price and the NAV (often called the premium or discount).
For equity funds, the final column provides 52-week returns based on market prices plus dividends.
For bond funds, the final column shows the past 12 months' income distributions as a percentage of the current market price.
Footnotes appear after a fund's name. a: the NAV and market price are ex dividend. b: the NAV is fully diluted. c: NAV, market price and premium or discount are as of Thursday's close. d: NAV, market price and premium or discount are as of Wednesday's close. e: NAV assumes rights offering is fully subscribed. v: NAV is converted at the commercial Rand rate. y: NAV and market price are in Canadian dollars.
