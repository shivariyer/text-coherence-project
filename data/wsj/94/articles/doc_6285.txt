United Dominion Industries Ltd. said its Litwin SA subsidiary in Paris signed a $73 million contract to upgrade a refinery in Turkey.
The contract is with the Turkish Petroleum Refineries Corp., which is owned by the government of Turkey, to upgrade its Izmit refinery, 56 miles southeast of Istanbul.
Work on the refinery is expected to take about 30 months to complete.
United Dominion is an engineering concern.
