INTELCOM GROUP Inc., Denver, filed plans for a public stock offering that could raise as much as $115 million.
The offering of five million common shares, plus an overallotment option of 750,000 shares, is being managed by underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc.
IntelCom said it will use about $16.7 million of the proceeds to pay debt and about $29.5 million to complete certain pending acquisitions with cash instead of stock as initially intended.
The balance will be used to expand the telephone company's communications services and for other purposes, the company said.
In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, IntelCom closed at $20, down 12.5 cents.
