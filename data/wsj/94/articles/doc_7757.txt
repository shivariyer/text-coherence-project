SuperMac Technology Inc. reported worse-than-expected results, posting a loss of $9.9 million on sharply higher sales of $48.5 million for the fourth quarter.
SuperMac attributed the loss to a larger than expected $16.6 million restructuring charge related to the consolidation of product development and excess facilities.
For the year-ago quarter, the company had net of $1.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on sales of $39.4 million.
Shares in the Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of desktop color-graphics systems rose $1 to $10.50 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading as investors bet that the company had taken a large enough charge to position itself for profitability.
But in a conference call with securities analysts, management said it couldn't predict whether the company would reach the black in its current quarter.
