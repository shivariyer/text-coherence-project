Finland's Kansallis-Osake-Pankki Oy banking group said its pretax loss narrowed to 2.66 billion markkaa ($478.2 million) in 1993 from 3.66 billion markkaa a year earlier and predicted it would remain in the red in 1994.
Revenue rose 21% to 4.89 billion markkaa from 4.04 billion markkaa.
KOP attributed the loss to continued high levels of write-offs on lending.
Such write-offs amounted to 2.91 billion markkaa in the year, down 32% from 4.27 billion markkaa in 1992.
The group also charged 900 million markkaa against earnings as a general provision for possible credit losses.
The extra provision was made to prepare for future risks from mainly domestic corporate customers, KOP said.
