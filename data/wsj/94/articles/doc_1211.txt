Dime Savings Bank of New York said it will offer a $6 million mortgage program in Massachusetts to settle a probe of its lending practices in the state.
The agreement with the state's attorney general follows a lengthy investigation of the lending practices of Dime Real Estate Services, Massachusetts Inc., a former real-estate services subsidiary during the late 1980s.
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger said customers said that Dime loan representatives had not adequately explained the risks of negative amortization mortgage loans, among other complaints.
The bank, which has maintained that its lending practices were not improper, said the agreement "could not be construed as implying any finding of wrongdoing."
Among other features, the Massachusetts program would allow Dime borrowers to convert negative amortization loans into fixed or adjustable-rate loans with no points; borrowers facing foreclosure may restructure their loans; and those who have already lost their home through foreclosure may apply for forgiveness of amounts still owed.
