A federal antitrust challenge to the proposed sale of the PayLess drugstore chain was settled when the acquiring TCH Corp. agreed to divest itself of stores in five western U.S. areas.
Kmart Corp. of Troy, Mich., agreed in December to sell its PayLess drugstore unit to TCH, a company owned by investor Leonard Green's merchant-banking firm.
The Federal Trade Commission challenged the deal, alleging it would violate antitrust laws.
As originally structured, the transaction would have eliminated drugstore competition in the five areas, the FTC said.
Los Angeles-based TCH currently owns the Thrifty and Bi-Mart store chain, which operate in areas where PayLess also does business.
"In part, the proposed settlement would require the TCH to divest, within one year, the pharmacy business either in the PayLess or the Thrifty or Bi-Mart stores it owns or will own in Bishop, Mt. Shasta and Taft, Calif.; Florence, Ore.; and Ellensburg, Wash.," an FTC statement said.
The commission will decide whether to make the proposed settlement final after a 60-day comment period.
