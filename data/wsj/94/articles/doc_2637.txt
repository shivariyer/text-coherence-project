FNB Rochester Corp. and the First National Bank of Rochester, the bank holding company's principal subsidiary, said the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, lifted its consent order against the bank.
The companies, Rochester, N.Y., said the move shows the Office of the Comptroller found the bank has substantially complied with its consent order, executed on June 9, 1992 -- satisfying the technical requirements, instituting necessary corrective action, improving controls and risk-management systems, and strengthening management and board supervision.
A separate consent order covering the holding company, issued by the Federal Reserve System, remains in force.
