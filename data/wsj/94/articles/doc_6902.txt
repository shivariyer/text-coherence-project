In a letter to the editor yesterday on breast cancer, there was a significant typographical error in one sentence.
It should have read: "In fact, five out of the eight trials have shown that mammography screening can reduce deaths from cancer, for women ages 40-49, by 22% (as in the Edinburgh trial) to as much as 49% (in the Malmo trial)."
(See: "Letters to the Editor: Mammograms Do Help Reduce Cancer Deaths" -- WSJ Feb. 2, 1994)
