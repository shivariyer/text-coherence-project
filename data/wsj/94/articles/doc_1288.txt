Trans World Music Corp. said earnings in its fourth quarter ended Jan. 29 fell 2% to $13.7 million, or $1.41 a share, compared with $14 million, or $1.44 a share, a year earlier.
The Albany, N.Y., music retailer, which operates 687 stores nationwide under such names as Record Town, Tape World, Coconuts and Saturday Matinee, said revenue rose 7% to $190.9 million, compared with $179 million in the same quarter a year earlier.
The fourth quarter is traditionally the most important in the music industry because so many shoppers give recorded music as gift items.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday, shares of Trans World Music closed at $12.25, down 50 cents, or 3.9%.
"This was a rebuilding year for us, one in which we rolled out a new software system which affected our buying, reordering and distribution," said Paul Cardinal, general counsel.
