Scott Paper Co. said it made a tender offer for its $72.1 million of 11 1/2% debentures due 2015.
The maker of paper products said the purchase would reduce interest costs.
A spokesman said the offer, priced in relation to certain Treasury notes, would amount to about $118 for each $100 of debentures, whereas the company would have to pay only about $105 at Dec. 1, 1995, the first date the debentures could be called by Scott.
