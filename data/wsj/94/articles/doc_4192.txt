State Auto Financial Corp. said that severe weather in the South and Midwest has resulted in a large number of damage claims that will adversely affect first-quarter earnings.
The Columbus, Ohio, insurance concern said preliminary results indicate losses from the January and February storms at about $6 million, or 51 cents a share, on a pretax basis.
In the first nine months of 1993, the company reported catastrophe losses of $4.2 million, or 35 cents a share.
State Auto will release its fourth-quarter figures in early March.
In the 1993 first quarter, the company reported net income of $2.6 million, or 22 cents a share.
