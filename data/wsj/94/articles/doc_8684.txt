Defiance Inc., citing the strong domestic automotive industry, said it expects per-share earnings for the fiscal year ending June 30 to be in the range of the mid-70 cents before accounting charges.
The Cleveland company also said sales for the year should approach $81 million.
In fiscal 1993, Defiance earned $3.4 million, or 54 cents a share, on $79.2 million in sales.
Defiance, a supplier of products, engineering and design services, said it received two contracts to supply cam-follower rollers, devices used in engines.
A contract with Eaton Corp. will add about $1.7 million in annual sales starting this summer.
A contract with General Motors Corp.'s A.C. Rochester unit will add about $7.3 million a year in sales starting in the summer of 1995.
These contracts extend current pacts with the two companies.
DEFIANCE Inc. expects per-share earnings in the mid-70 cents area before accounting changes for the year ending June 30.
An article yesterday incorrectly called the accounting changes charges.
