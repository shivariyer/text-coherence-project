Fieldcrest Cannon Inc. said the prospective buyers of its Bangor & Aroostook Railroad in Maine have told the textile company that they won't close on the transaction.
The railroad was recently acquired by Fieldcrest Cannon as part of its acquisition of Amoskeag Co.
The railroad was to be acquired by BAR Acquisition Co., Greenwich, Conn., a company created for the purpose of making the acquisition.
The purchase price was to be $28.8 million, Fieldcrest said when it announced the deal last September.
Fieldcrest said it's holding talks with other parties interested in buying the railroad.
