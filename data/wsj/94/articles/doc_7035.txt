Your recent article on electric rates ("Why the Increase?
How Do We Compare?
Answering Questions About Electric Rates," Jan. 12) reported that Upshur Rural Electric Cooperative has the state's lowest residential electric rates.
In fact, I would like to point out that the city of Fredericksburg's 4,000 residential electric customers pay lower residential rates than Upshur Rural Electric Cooperative customers.
Our commercial and industrial electric rates, as well as the city's water and sewer rates, are also among the state's lowest.
