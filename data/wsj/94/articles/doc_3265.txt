Spectral Diagnostics Inc. said it obtained a U.S. patent for its main product, a diagnostic kit aimed at determining whether or not a patient has suffered a heart attack.
Spectral said the kit, which identifies certain proteins usually produced by the body during a heart attack by applying drops of blood to a pre-treated card, is undergoing clinical trials in Canada and the U.S.
Toronto-based Spectral is developing a range of cardiac diagnostic tests.
