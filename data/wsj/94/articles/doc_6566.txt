Babbage's Inc. said a "substantial decline" in sales of video game systems and software drove comparable-store sales down 13% in its fourth quarter, ended Saturday.
The figures represent sales at stores open for at least a year.
Total sales increased to $102.8 million, up only 2% from $100.7 million a year earlier.
Sales for fiscal year 1994 increased 12% to $233.4 million from $209.2 million and sales at stores open more than a year ended the 52-week period down 5%.
The software retailer said it cut prices on video game software titles in early December and had reduced its inventory by more than 25% per store compared with the same time a year earlier.
