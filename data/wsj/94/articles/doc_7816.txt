Compaq Computer Corp. said its net income jumped 70% in the fourth quarter on a crush of holiday personal-computer sales.
The nation's third-largest personal-computer maker reported net income of $151 million, or $1.74 a share, compared with $89 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.
Sales surged to $2.2 billion, from $1.4 billion.
Though Compaq's results came in about 20 cents a share above most analysts' estimates, its stock sank $2.125, or 2.6%, to $81.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Traders attributed the drop to profit-taking and scattered worries that Compaq's decision to buy computer chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. as well as Intel Corp. could cost it some corporate customers.
But analysts generally praised Compaq's results and said they saw no evidence that the company's zooming growth was about to slow.
"Compaq really seems to be breaking away from the pack," said Todd D. Bakar, a technology analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.
Still, Compaq was hardly alone in its impressive fourth-quarter showing.
AST Research Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. also reported strong year-end PC numbers, primarily because of a surge of business from consumers buying computers for the home.
Daryl J. White, Compaq's chief financial officer, said the company's ProLinea and Presario lines turned in particularly impressive results during the quarter.
Mr. White said Compaq will focus this year on building up its inventory in anticipation of continued strong demand.
Compaq shipped 3.1 million units last year, up 98% from the previous year.
