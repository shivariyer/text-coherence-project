Bombardier Inc. said it selected Dowty Aerospace Landing Gear Canada to supply the landing gear for Bombardier's planned long-range business jet.
Dowty, a unit of TI Group PLC of Britain, is the third "risk-sharing" partner named by Bombardier to help develop its Global Express jet.
A Bombardier spokesman said eight or nine partners are expected to be named; the partners will shoulder about half of the aircraft's development cost of around 800 million Canadian dollars (US$588 million), excluding the engine.
Bombardier makes transportation equipment.
