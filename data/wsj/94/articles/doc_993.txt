The House approved the cornerstone of President Clinton's education agenda yesterday, a $422 million school-overhaul plan that will lead to the creation of voluntary national academic standards.
The legislation, called Goals 2000, approved by a House-Senate conference committee last week, establishes eight national education goals and establishes a panel to devise model academic and testing standards.
Goals 2000 encourages school overhaul, but doesn't mandate anything.
If states want to get federal funds to overhaul their schools, they must submit comprehensive plans to the Education Department that explain how they would reach the national education goals, which include increasing high-school graduation rates.
The plan also bans smoking at schools and day-care centers that receive federal funds.
It also requires school districts to devise gun policies that carry mandatory one-year expulsions.
The Senate began considering the measure last night, but Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.CC) started a filibuster because his school-prayer amendment had been weakened.
Unless the bill passes by the end of the month, the $105 million fiscal 1994 appropriation will expire.
