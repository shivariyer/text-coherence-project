Skolniks Inc. said it reached agreements with two distributors that more than doubles the number of supermarkets and convenience stores to which its bagels will be delivered.
The bagel and spread maker said 2,400 new locations are added through Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s McLane distribution division, and 1,200 more locations through Core-Mark International Inc., a closely held distributor based in San Francisco.
Skolniks said it also has commitments from 7,000 additional locations that will begin receiving deliveries within 90 days, either through McLane, Core-Mark, Fleming Cos. or Scrivner Inc.
Skolniks, based in Oklahoma City, quadrupled its bagel-making capacity to 2.5 million bagels a week last month, with the opening of a new plant in New Jersey.
