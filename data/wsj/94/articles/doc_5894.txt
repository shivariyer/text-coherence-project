Scandinavia Airlines System said it intends to lower operating costs by 2.91 billion kronor ($362.9 million) by the end of 1995.
The cost-cutting program involves the elimination of 2,900 full-time jobs, or roughly one of every seven of the airlines' 20,000 full-time employees, said SAS.
The program approved by the SAS board yesterday expands saving measures announced in November by interim President Jan Reinas by roughly 400 million kronor.
