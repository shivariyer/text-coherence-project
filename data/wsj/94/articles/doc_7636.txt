Ultratech Stepper Inc., a chip and computer storage-equipment maker, said it expects to report fourth-quarter earnings exceeding analysts' consensus estimates by at least 10%.
The San Jose, Calif., company will formally announce its results next week.
But in an interview, Chief Executive Officer Arthur Zafiropoulo said he expects Ultratech to post earnings of $1.6 million to $1.7 million, or 22 cents to 23 cents, a share on revenue of $16.4 million.
Analysts have expected the company to earn from 19 cents to 20 cents a share, on revenue of about $16 million.
Mr. Zafiropoulo attributed the better-than-expected results to higher sales abroad.
Ultratech's backlog also is stronger.
As of Dec. 31, the value of orders exceeded $30 million, Mr. Zafiropoulo said.
