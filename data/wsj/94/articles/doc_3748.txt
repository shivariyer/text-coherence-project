The economic outlook for this year is substantially stronger than it was three months ago, according to the 30 forecasters surveyed each quarter by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
The forecasters expect the economy to expand an inflation-adjusted 3.5% in 1994, up from the 2.8% forecast three months earlier.
At that pace, the economists say, the unemployment rate will decline gradually to about 6.3% by this time next year; the jobless rate in January was 6.7%.
Even though the California earthquake and severe weather in the East and Midwest will shave the growth rate in the first quarter, the forecasters still expect the economy to grow at a 3.2% annual rate in the period and at a 3.3% rate in the second quarter, substantially faster than previously predicted.
The economists now expect the inflation rate to rise steadily in 1994, to 3.3% in the fourth quarter from 2.9% in the first.
Inflation is expected to average 3.1% this year and 3.2% next year.
The economists now predict interest rates to be about two-tenths of a percentage point higher than they predicted in the last survey.
They now expect the yield on three-month Treasury bills to average 3.5% in 1994 and 3.8% in 1995.
In the survey, which was conducted last month before the bond market pushed up long-term interest rates, the economists said they expect the yield on 10-year Treasury notes to average 5.9% in 1994 and 6% in 1995.
