Bausch & Lomb Inc. said it got approval to begin marketing generic versions of Allergan Inc.'s Betagan, a beta blocker used to treat ocular hypertension and chronic open angle glaucoma.
No other company markets a generic version of Betagan, which had U.S. sales last year of more than $40 million.
Bausch & Lomb said it expects to sell its product at 55% to 60% of the price of Betagan.
The Bausch & Lomb products will sell under the names Levobunolol HCL Ophthalmic Solutions 0.5% and 0.25%.
The Rochester, N.Y., health-care products and optics maker said it will begin shipping within a week.
The products will be produced at Bausch & Lomb's Tampa, Fla., factory.
