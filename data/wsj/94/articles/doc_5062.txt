Sandvik AB, a Sweden-based cemented carbide group, has signed a letter of intent to acquire Krupp Widia GmbH of Germany from the Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp group.
Financial terms of the transaction weren't disclosed and the deal is subject to a final agreement and approval by cartel authorities and the supervisory boards of the two groups.
The agreement covers Widia's cemented carbide and magnet sector but not its medical engineering business, said Sandvik.
Sandvik said Widia will operate as an independent subsidiary within the group with its own research and development, production and marketing activities.
Consolidated turnover of the Widia group will be around 1.6 billion kronor ($199.5 million), said Sandvik.
