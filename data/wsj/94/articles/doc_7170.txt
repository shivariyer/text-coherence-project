Major U.S. airlines recorded no passenger fatalities in 1993, but they experienced more minor accidents than in 1992, the National Transportation Safety Board said.
The safety board said the fatality rate for major airlines was the lowest since 1980.
Commuter airlines had four fatal accidents, including a crash that killed 18 in Minnesota; that compares with seven fatal accidents last year.
Privately owned planes had 385 fatal accidents, the lowest level in at least 10 years.
The Air Transport Association, which represents large airlines, said the "outstanding 1993 safety record" reflects the industry's "long-term commitment to safety."
The group complained that "critics are raising the safety bugaboo as a way to scare the public" -- a reference to congressional critics of the Clinton administration's plan to create a government corporation to run the air traffic-control system.
Still, while the death rate on major airlines declined from the 31 passenger deaths in 1992, the accident rate rose.
The safety board said major airlines had 23 accidents without passenger fatalities in 1993, up from 12 in 1992.
