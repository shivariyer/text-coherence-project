Making a bet that Salomon Inc.'s high-profile problems are behind it, billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett has spent $272.5 million adding to his stake in the securities company.
The purchase of more than 5.5 million Salomon shares, disclosed late Friday through the release of Securities and Exchange Commission filings, increased Mr. Buffett's stake to 19.04% from 14.7%.
The legendary investor already has a paper profit on the bulk of the shares purchased recently.
The shares were bought in February and early March, all but 624,300 of them at prices below Salomon's Friday close.
That close was $49.625, up 50 cents, after which the buying by Mr. Buffett's camp was disclosed.
The purchases were made by National Indemnity Co., a unit of the Omaha, Neb., holding company he runs, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Mr. Buffett is Salomon's largest shareholder and served as its interim chairman from August 1991 through mid-1992, shepherding the company through a federal investigation that cost the Salomon prestige, clients, market share and several top officials, in addition to penalties and restitution totaling $290 million.
The investigation resulted from disclosure, in August 1991, that its Salomon Brothers brokerage unit had violated bidding rules in Treasury note auctions held in December 1990 and in February and May 1991.
Chairman John Gutfreund stepped down as a result of the subsequent scandal; Mr. Buffett took the helm until June 1992, when his hand-picked successor, Robert Denham, then the company's general counsel, succeeded him.
Mr. Buffett remains a Salomon director.
In September, Mr. Buffett received clearance from federal regulators to lift his stake in Salomon to as much as 24.9%.
He still needs board approval, however, to crack the 20% barrier.
Guy Moszkowski, securities industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said Mr. Buffett's recent purchases were "meaningful, and it's even more meaningful that he waited until after the stunning fourth-quarter results," which moved share prices higher, before buying.
Such a move suggests long-term confidence in the stock.
In the fourth quarter, boosted by income from its proprietary-trading operations, Salomon earned $4.33 a share compared with $1.10 in the year-earlier quarter.
Mr. Moszkowski has a "buy" recommendation on Salomon shares, considering them underpriced relative to the industry.
Mr. Buffett increased his Salomon holdings in a series of 18 separate purchases made from Feb. 3 through Friday, when the bulk of the shares, 2,979,000, were purchased.
He paid share prices ranging from $47.98 to $50.70, according to the company.
This round of purchases follows a spate of buying over the winter; last November, Mr. Buffett bought 495,200 shares for $21 million, raising his Salomon stake to 14.7% from 14.3%.
The purchases bring Berkshire Hathaway's total holdings to 6,015,000 shares and 700,000 preferred shares, which are convertible to 18.4 million common shares at $38 a share.
While most securities-company stocks have given back their gains in recent months as the Wall Street boom has slowed, Salomon shares climbed in 1993 and have held relatively steady for the past several months.
The stock hit a 12-month low of $34.375 last May, traded as high as $51.875 in September and has been in a $47-$50 trading range for much of 1994.
Mr. Buffett first became a major Salomon shareholder in 1987 when he bought the preferred shares, a 12% stake, for $700 million, a purchase that helped fend off Ronald Perelman's unwelcome advances.
