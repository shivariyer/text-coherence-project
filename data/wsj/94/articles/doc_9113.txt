United Kingdom leisure and entertainment concern Thorn EMI PLC said in London that it will augment its current twice-annual results announcements with quarterly statements.
The company will make its first quarterly announcement Feb. 22 with a statement on the group's results for the nine-month period ending in December 1993.
Thorn, which has interests in music, rentals and electronics, said it will announce on May 24 results for its financial year ending March 31.
The company said it decided to step up the number of statements in light of a London Stock Exchange's consultive document on the dissemination of price-sensitive information.
Although the exchange didn't give companies reporting guidelines, it urged them to formally disclose price-sensitive information, in part to prevent selective leaks to the press.
