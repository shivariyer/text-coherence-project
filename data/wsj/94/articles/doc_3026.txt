Westcott Communications Inc., Carrollton, Texas, proposed to acquire Sandy Corp., a Troy, Mich., provider of corporate training programs, for about $19 million in stock.
Westcott, an operator of specialized satellite-TV networks, has been eyeing Sandy since 1991, when the company bought more than 6% of Sandy's common stock with hopes of acquiring the remainder, but was rebuffed by William H. Sandy, chairman and chief executive officer.
Westcott's chief financial officer, Phyllis Farragut, said Westcott hopes Mr. Sandy, who is 64 years old and controls 44% of the firm according to Sandy's 1994 proxy, will be more interested in selling.
Sandy said its board would meet today to discuss the unsolicited proposal, which expires Friday.
Ms. Farragut said Westcott isn't interested in making a hostile offer for Sandy.
Westcott is offering one share for every 2.81 Sandy shares.
Westcott closed yesterday at $23.25, down 50 cents, in the Nasdaq Stock Market.
On the American Stock Exchange, Sandy gained $1.50 to $7.325.
