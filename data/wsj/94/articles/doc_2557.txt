A federal judge sentenced a former LaSalle National Bank loan officer to 52 months in prison for bank fraud, the U.S. attorney's office here said.
In December, Robert Fredenburgh, 55 years old, and now a resident of Palm Beach, Fla., pleaded guilty to a long-running scheme in which he issued 20 fraudulent loans totaling $1.8 million.
To get the money, he issued 17 "nominee" loans -- without their knowledge -- to relatives, as well as real and fictitious bank customers, then pocketed the loan money.
Much of the money from the bogus loans went to fund a friend's failing real estate company, which was carrying a big loan at LaSalle, Assistant U.S. Attorney John H. Newman said; he added that three of the fraudulent loans were wrongfully made to the friend, 60-year-old William P. Joughlin.
Mr. Joughlin and Mr. Fredenburgh earlier pleaded guilty to a check-kiting scheme designed to generate cash needed to conceal the fraudulent loans.
That part of the scheme cost the bank an additional $953,000, prosecutors said.
Besides the 52-month jail term, Mr. Fredenburgh was ordered to pay restitution of $2,450,000.
Mr. Joughlin, who now lives in Naples, Fla., was sentenced to 21 months in prison, and ordered to pay $604,000 in restitution.
LaSalle is owned by ABN Amro Holding NV of the Netherlands.
