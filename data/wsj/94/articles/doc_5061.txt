Unifying Germany is proving more explosive than anyone expected.
More than three years after the line dividing East and West Germany was officially erased, authorities keep finding that more land mines litter the eastern side of the border zone than they had thought.
The German army, which is overseeing mine clearing in the region, announced that 93 more miles of the border needed to be scoured for mines.
Squads composed of former East German border guards have been clearing the mines at a cautious snail's pace in the "death strip" for nearly two and a half years.
So far, they have covered 43 of 105 miles that had been designated as dangerous.
The army had hoped that they would finish the task this year.
The extra 93 miles were classified as dangerous and now must be marked with signs, after several mines were found by farmers in areas that were supposed to be mine-free.
In all, East Germany is believed to have planted 1.3 million mines in the border region, though most were supposedly cleared in the late 1980s.
