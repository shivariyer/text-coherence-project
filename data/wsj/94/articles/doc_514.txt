Business users of private overnight mailing companies will no longer have to live in fear that postal inspectors will audit their mail rooms to see if their shipments truly merit "overnight" treatment.
In "Postal Bully" (Review & Outlook, January 4) we described the Postal Service's practice of showing up at companies to demand proof that the overnight mailings were necessary.
Facing a Congressional revolt against this extraordinary policy, Postmaster General Marvin Runyon said last week that his inspectors will no longer "initiate" reviews that last year resulted in several companies paying the equivalent of fines for not using the Postal Service's own Express Mail service.
We certainly welcome the stand down, but more fundamentally, Congress ought to re-examine how the Postal Service's first-class mail monopoly allows it to take such anticompetitive actions in the first place.
