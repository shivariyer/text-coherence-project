Germany's Degussa AG said its pretax profit in the fiscal first quarter rose 25%, with gains led by its chemicals sector.
The Frankfurt concern reported pretax profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31 of 61 million marks ($34.7 million), up from 49 million marks a year earlier.
Degussa expects improvements to continue in this fiscal year, Chairman Gert Becker said.
The chairman attributed the improved results to the restructuring begun three years ago, which has enabled the metals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals company to bolster its profits despite continuing economic difficulties.
Degussa said chemicals sales rose 5%, and profit was "clearly over the previous year."
The improvement came as a result of cost relief and revival of demand in foreign markets, Degussa said.
In Frankfurt trading, Degussa shares rose 13 marks ($7.39) to 467 marks.
