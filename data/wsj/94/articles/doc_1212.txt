Springs Industries, Fort Mill, S.C., said it plans to cut annual operating costs by $15 million and boost prices on its bedding products, in response to an expected 30% to 40% decline in first-quarter operating earnings per share.
The textile concern said it would reduce salaried jobs -- through consolidation, attrition and a hold on hiring -- as well as defer certain capital projects.
Springs declined to specify how many jobs might be lost or which projects might be affected.
It also said it would cut costs by boosting efficiencies in administrative areas.
Springs said the moves follow lower-than-anticipated earnings in the first two months of 1994.
Springs said it expects to post a first-quarter profit of 30 cents to 35 cents a share.
In the 1993 first quarter, Springs had operating profit of $9.2 million, or 51 cents a share, on revenue of $501.8 million.
An accounting adjustment of $72.5 million resulted in a net loss of $63.4 million, or $3.56 a share.
