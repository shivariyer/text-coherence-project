Canadian production of market pulp rose 4% in December from a year earlier, while shipments rose 11%.
The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 617,000 metric tons of market pulp in December, up from 595,000 tons a year earlier.
A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds.
The December 88% operating rate was unchanged from a year earlier, the association reported.
Shipments in December rose to 683,000 tons from 615,000 tons a year earlier.
Canadian producer inventories at the end of December were 547,000 tons, a 26-day supply, compared with 613,000 tons, a 31-day supply, in November.
Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products.
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill.
