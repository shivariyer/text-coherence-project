In response to your Dec. 27 editorial "A Snail Retreat": Best Friends Animal Sanctuary is the "wildlife refuge" to which you refer.
It's the largest "no-kill" animal sanctuary for dogs and cats in the country, and it's adjacent to Brandt Child's property Federal officials told Mr. Child he would be fined $50,000 per snail if the geese someone abandoned on his property ate any of the endangered Kanab ambersnails in the lakes on his land.
Yes, it's true that Mr. Child will not be allowed to turn his small piece of this delicate land into another golf course; besides, there's already a golf course in the tiny local town, and most tourists don't come here to play golf.
Mostly, they're ecotourists and animal lovers who come to visit the inspiring wonders of the Grand Canyon and the Golden Circle of national parks surrounding Angel Canyon.
When we heard about the ambersnail problem, we offered to relocate as many as possible of the critters to the sanctuary here, where there's a good snail habitat.
But the publicity Mr. Child has enjoyed is promising to make his piece of the local ecosystem a more profitable enterprise than a golf course could ever have done.
This summer it will be another stopping place for nature lovers on vacation.
