Stocks crept mostly lower as nervous investors watched bond prices slide.
A move by the Federal Reserve last Friday to tighten credit conditions has left investors sharply focused on the action in bonds and market interest rates.
They didn't like what they saw yesterday, analysts said.
The 30-year Treasury bond lost more than 3/4 point, lifting its yield to 6.45%.
Bond investors were said to be worried about the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions -- which got under way yesterday with the sale of three-year notes -- and about a government inflation report due on Friday.
The stock-market losses were much less severe.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost a scant 0.29 to 3906.03.
Broad-based indexes that track mostly New York Stock Exchange issues also eased.
Advancing issues on the Big Board outnumbered decliners about 1,172 to 962.
Volume was 318,040,000 shares, down from 346,780,000 on Monday.
The Dow Jones industrials never moved more than 15 points higher or lower than their closing level of Monday, when they closed with a gain of 34.90.

"You've got something of a battle going on between those who are looking to lock in recent profits and those looking for bargains after Friday's decline," said Gail Dudack, market strategist at S.G. Warburg & Co.
The net effect of that action was little change in stock prices.
Despite the mixed tone yesterday, Ms. Dudack said she is concerned that stocks could tumble over the next six weeks.
A move above 6.5% in the 30-year bond yield, combined with signs that the flow of money into mutual funds is easing, could send the Dow Jones Industrial Average back to the 3600 level, she said.
But Peter Cardillo, a senior vice president at Westfalia Investments, said the worries about interest rates are unwarranted.
He doesn't think the Federal Reserve's move on Friday was large enough to stanch the flow of cash into funds, and he expects the market to resume its climb as soon as next week.
