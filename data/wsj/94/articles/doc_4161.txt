Under threat of contempt of court, a former aide to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski testified before a federal grand jury investigating corruption allegations against the congressman.
The former aide, Celeste Gabinski, gave her secret testimony before the expiration of a 10-day deadline, after which she could have been jailed.
One of the charges the grand jury is investigating is whether the Chicago Democrat kept Mrs. Gabinski on his office payroll after she no longer worked there.
Mrs. Gabinski testified once after being granted immunity from prosecution, but she was cited for contempt of court when she refused to testify again.
Her lawyer wanted assurance that she would not be subjected to perjury charges after the second testimony.
She ultimately testified again without a new grant of immunity.
President Clinton plans to campaign for Mr. Rostenkowski, who faces a tough primary vote on March 15.
Mr. Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is a major player in the Clinton administration's top legislative priorities, including health-care, welfare and the budget.
Attorney General Janet Reno told reporters yesterday that she has an opinion about the president campaigning for Mr. Rostenkowski, but she wouldn't say what it is.
She did say she has told the White House that she "wanted this investigation conducted in a professional way, free of politics."
