Domtar Inc. said it agreed in principle to merge its merchant-distribution division, which sold about 150 million Canadian dollars (US$111 million) of paper last year, with closely held WWF Paper Corp., Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
Domtar said it will own 25% of the merged paper-distribution concern, which will have sales of about $800 million.
Domtar is a forest-products and construction-materials concern.
Its merchant division operates warehouses in Canada and handles paper sales other than those made directly from the company's mills.
