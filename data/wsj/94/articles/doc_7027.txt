Computer Products Inc. said John N. Lemasters, chairman and chief executive officer, will resign those posts as soon as a successor is found.
Mr. Lemasters, 60 years old, said he and other directors decided to search for a new CEO following the resignation of Ron Ritchie, chief operating officer, in January.
Mr. Ritchie's resignation derailed the succession plans, which called for Mr. Ritchie to become CEO in 1995.
Mr. Lemasters will remain a director and consultant to the company.
The electronics concern also reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $1.1 million, or six cents a share, reflecting a $3 million restructuring charge.
In the year-ago quarter, the company posted net income of $1.7 million, or eight cents a share.
Sales rose 14% to $33.9 million from $29.9 million in 1992.
Mr. Lemasters said the restructuring will reduce plant capacity and eliminate about 5% of the company's 1,500 jobs.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Computer Products shares closed at $2.4375, up 12.5 cents, or 5.4%.
