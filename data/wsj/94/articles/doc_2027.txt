Brush Wellman Inc. said strong demand for its alloy products has resulted in an "improving outlook" for first-quarter earnings.
The company said it is likely to earn 30 cents to 35 cents a share for the quarter, compared with Wall Street analysts' estimates of 16 cents to 20 cents a share.
For the year-ago quarter, the Cleveland concern reported net of $1.15 million, or seven cents a share.
In a statement, the company cited improving sales of beryllium-containing alloys world-wide.
It cautioned however, that the earnings growth is expected to moderate in the second half, citing particular concern for defense-related sales.
