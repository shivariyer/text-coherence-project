General Motors Corp. revived the old Impala name for its new sporty Caprice-like sedan, which it priced at $22,495.
The Impala SS has a 260-horsepower LT1 Corvette engine, leather interior and a 4l60-E four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission.
GM last used the Impala name in 1969.
The new Impala will be built at its Arlington, Texas, assembly plant, which builds the Chevrolet Caprice and other rear-wheel-drive vehicles.
GM plans to build only 5,000 Impalas.
