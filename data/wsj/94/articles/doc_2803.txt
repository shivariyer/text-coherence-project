EMC Corp. said it signed a letter of intent to acquire the assets of Array Technology Corp., Boulder, Colo., a subsidiary of Tandem Computers Inc.
EMC said in Hopkington, Mass., that the deal is a cash transaction totaling "less than $10 million" and is subject to the signing of a definitive agreement.
Array Technology develops and makes Redundant Arrays of Independent Disk, or RAID, storage products.
The acquisition includes more than 20 disk array technology patents issued to or filed by Array.
EMC, a maker of large computer storage systems, said Array's experience in open systems storage technology will "have an important role in the development of EMC's client/server products scheduled to be released in late 1994."
