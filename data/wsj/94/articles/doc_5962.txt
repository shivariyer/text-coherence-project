A state-court judge in Los Angeles dismissed all claims for damages sought in a lawsuit by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. against Kirk Kerkorian, the studio's former owner.
MGM's claims against a Los Angeles accounting firm remain intact.
The 1992 suit had charged that Mr. Kerkorian, his Los Angeles-based Tracinda Corp. and two associates failed to disclose adequately the studio's financial problems when they sold it in 1990.
A separate suit filed by MGM's owner, French bank Credit Lyonnais SA, wasn't affected by the judge's ruling.
Mr. Kerkorian has filed a cross-complaint against Credit Lyonnais and MGM, alleging breach of contract and fraud.
These claims are also unaffected by the court's dismissal of MGM's damage claims.
Tracinda, Mr. Kerkorian's private investment vehicle, is based in Beverly Hills, Calif.
