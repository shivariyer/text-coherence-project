A state-court jury in Newark, N.J., awarded $3.5 million to a former Mobil Oil executive who had filed a wrongful-discharge suit, alleging he was fired after disclosing health problems associated with Mobil products.
Neil Mullin, an attorney representing plaintiff Myron A. Mehlman, said the jury awarded $2.6 million in actual damages and $875,000 for emotional distress.
The jury was still to consider punitive damages against the Mobil Corp. unit.
A spokesman at Mobil Corp. headquarters in Fairfax, Va., said the company is withholding comment for now.
The plaintiff, the former director of toxicology and manager of Mobil Oil's Environmental Health & Science Laboratories in Princeton, N.J., alleged that he was fired in 1989 after making a presentation where he warned that the levels of benzene in certain products posed a serious health and environmental hazard.
Mr. Mehlman alleged that he was fired in violation of New Jersey's 1986 Conscientious Employee Protection Act.
Mobil has maintained in court that Mr. Mehlman was fired for legitimate reasons, and that it doesn't owe him any damages.
