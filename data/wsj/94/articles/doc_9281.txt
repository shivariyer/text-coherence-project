AMR Corp., continuing its strategy to expand into nonairline businesses, said it is bidding to design, build, finance and operate a passenger terminal at Ataturk International Airport in Istanbul, Turkey.
AMR, whose airline unit is American Airlines, said in Fort Worth, Texas, that its partners in the proposed project include two major Turkish construction companies.
The AMR unit involved in the Turkish venture is AMR Training & Consulting Group, which provides airport development and other transportation services.
AMR Training recently agreed to provide Turkish Airlines with English instruction.
Another AMR unit, AMR Services Corp., provides Turkish Airlines with ground-handling services at Newark International Airport in New Jersey.
