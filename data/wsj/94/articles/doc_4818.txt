Monsanto Co. donated to the Nature Conservancy 209 acres of northeast Alabama land that has become a popular gathering place for the region's small number of bald eagles.
The Washington-based organization in turn donated the former Monsanto land along Lake Guntersville to Alabama's newly formed "Forever Wild" land-acquisition project.
The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit conservation group that seeks to preserve biological diversity, frequently works with corporations.
For several years, Alabama wildlife officials have been releasing baby eagles, in an effort to restore the raptors to the area from which they disappeared some 30 years ago.
Last year, nine pairs successfully nested in the state; some of the eagles have begun frequenting the former Monsanto land.
The land, which the company valued at $550,000, is adjacent to Monsanto land housing a long-closed company plant; it will be added to a nearby state park.
