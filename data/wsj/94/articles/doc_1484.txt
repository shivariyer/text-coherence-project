Allerion Inc. said it will post a fiscal fourth-quarter charge of about $1 million that will result in a net loss for the quarter.
The East Hanover, N.J., company, which changed its name from Ultimate Corp. about a year ago, previously had said it expected to report an operating profit for its fourth quarter, which ends April 30.
The "unanticipated" charge covers a proposed settlement of a five-year-old class action lawsuit resulting from the company's 1988 restructuring, and an expected award in a separate software license dispute from the mid-1980s.
The proposed settlement, which consists of cash and warrants to buy shares, needs court approval.
Although Allerion is still exploring its options on appealing an arbitration award in the software licensing dispute, it decided to reserve the full amount of the potential award.
The charge is about evenly split between the two awards.
Allerion said that although the charge would interrupt its quarter-to-quarter pattern of operating improvement, it allows the company to close "a long period of litigation and focus fully on moving ahead" with its networking strategy.
Allerion helps companies integrate and manage computer networks.
