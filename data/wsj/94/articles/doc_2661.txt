Your March 1 editorial "Presumption of Rascality," on the Senate Banking Committee's hearings on the Resolution Trust Corporation, raised many serious, legitimate questions, but regrettably engaged in some unwarranted and inaccurate personal snipings.
During my years in the Senate I have proven my willingness to investigate unpopular matters.
I was the first to expose Oliver North's private aid network; I exposed Manuel Noriega's drug connections and first uncovered the link to BCCI; I produced an unmatched record of the BCCI scandal; I sought full investigative powers from the very committee you encourage to investigate now, and received no support from the Republicans you defend.
Ironically, what you referred to as my "pious concern" that a partisan, political hearing is not the proper venue for a Whitewater investigation is shared by independent counsel Robert Fiske, a lifelong Republican who was nominated by President Bush to be second-in-command at the Justice Department.
As you may remember, Congress has proven its ability to interfere with and bumble on-going investigations.
Oliver North, John Poindexter and others had their convictions overturned precisely because of conflicts that arose directly from the congressional hearings into the Iran/Contra affair.
And finally, it's apparent that guilt by association is still alive at The Wall Street Journal.
David Paul was no more my "buddy" than Mike Milken and Ivan Boesky were yours.
Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.)
