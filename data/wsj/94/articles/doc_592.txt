Southern Co. said its Southern Electric International unit, in partnership with a subsidiary of Amoco Production Co., will invest more than $100 million to purchase a 49% stake in power generation plants in Trinidad and Tobago.
Specific terms are being negotiated.
Under the agreement, the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commissions will retain a 51% interest in its generating facilities, while Southern Electric would operate and maintain the plants.
