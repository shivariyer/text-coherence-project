Digital Microwave Corp. had a fiscal third-quarter net loss of $25.4 million, due to the settlement of a lawsuit and the anticipated liquidation of a venture in Malaysia.
The maker of communications products in San Jose, Calif., said the quarter, ended Dec. 31, included a one-time charge of $20 million for expenses associated with settling a class-action lawsuit, filed in 1990, which had alleged securities-laws violations.
The company said the settlement is contingent on its ability to complete a financing, and on court approval.
In addition, the third quarter included a one-time charge of $7 million for write-offs associated with a joint venture in Malaysia.
Digitial Microwave had a net loss for the quarter of $25.4 million, or $2.03 a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $1.1 million, or nine cents a share.
Sales rose 14% to $30.6 million, compared with $26.8 million a year earlier.
