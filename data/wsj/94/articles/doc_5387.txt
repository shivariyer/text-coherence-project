John Labatt Ltd. shut down about 30% of its domestic beer production by locking out more than 1,000 workers in Quebec after they rejected a contract proposal.
The move reflects the determination of Canadian brewers to cut costs because of an expected increase in low-priced imports from the U.S. following last summer's beer trade agreement.
"We have a situation where we need to be cost-competitive with American brewers.
They're going to be in our sandbox within the next few months," said Labatt spokesman Alain Bolduc.
The lockout, which took effect over the weekend, halts production at the plant which produces beer for the Quebec market, Labatt's second largest in Canada after Ontario.
Mr. Bolduc said the company has up to three weeks of inventory to continue supplying its distribution outlets in Quebec.
Francois LaPorte, spokesman for Teamsters union Local 1999, said there were no plans to resume talks with the company.
He said the union was waiting for Labatt to make the first move.
The proposed pact won the approval of a majority of the union's executive committee.
But it was soundly defeated by 71% of the union's membership.
