Mattel Inc. said it prepaid $100 million of the high-interest debt it assumed in last year's acquisition of Fisher-Price Inc., and will take a $14.7 million charge in 1993's fourth-quarter earnings to reflect a prepayment penalty and other costs.
The El Segundo, Calif., toy maker said the debt that was prepaid carried a 10.69% interest rate, giving Mattel "significant savings" in future interest expenses.
Prepayment funds came from Mattel's "year-end cash position of approximately $500 million," the company said.
In 1992's fourth quarter, Mattel reported net income of $35.7 million on sales of $511 million.
However, a Mattel spokesman said quarterly earnings to be reported next week will restate the 1992 period to give pro-forma effect to the $1.1 billion acquisition of Fisher-Price.
Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Mattel common closed at $22.25, off 50 cents, on volume of 613,100 shares.
