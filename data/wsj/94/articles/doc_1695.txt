Franklin Holding Corp., New York, said it agreed to end its investment partnership formed in 1992 for the purpose of acquiring radio stations.
The partnership, which Franklin described as "successful," acquired seven Southeastern radio stations over the past 18 months, and has sold, or agreed to sell, six of them at a "substantial" profit.
Franklin is a holding company with interests in media properties.
The dissolution of the partnership, expected to take place by mid-May, will give Franklin ownership of the remaining radio station, WRKA-FM of Louisville, Ky., which the company said it will use as a base to acquire additional radio stations.
