General Instrument Corp. said it received an order valued at about $30 million from Adelphia Communications Corp. for 120,000 DigiCable set-top digital converters.
General Instrument said it expects to make initial deliveries in early 1995.
Adelphia plans to roll out digital compression gradually while maintaining a base of analog-addressable converters, General Instrument said.
