Reuters Holdings PLC, benefiting from booming business in financial markets, reported a 15% increase in pretax profit on a 20% rise in revenue last year and said it will split its shares.
The information and financial-services group's earnings rose to 440 million ($652.3 million) from 383 million, slightly higher than most analysts' predictions.
Per-share earnings jumped 17% to 72 pence from 61.8 pence.
Revenue, meanwhile, climbed to 1.87 billion from 1.57 billion; but excluding the effect of currency fluctuations, revenue rose 8%.
Reuters said it planned to split its ordinary shares into four new shares, and that its American depositary shares will be redefined to comprise six shares instead of the current three.
The company also raised the final dividend to 19.8 pence from 15.9 pence, for a total dividend for the year of 26 pence, a rise of 23% from 1992's payout.
On the London Stock Exchange, Reuters shares jumped 64.25 pence, or 3.4%, to 19.70 a share, while the rest of the market finished about 0.5% higher.
