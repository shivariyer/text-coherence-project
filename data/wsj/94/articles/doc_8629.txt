Seven more large banks reported increased fourth-quarter earnings as lending rose at many of the companies, offsetting a narrowing of net interest margins.
Loan-loss provisions fell sharply at many banks.
BankAmerica Corp., the nation's second largest bank, had a 4.9% earnings rise.
Other profit rises were: PNC Bank Corp., 19%; Norwest Corp., more than double; Fleet Financial Group Inc., 66%; NBD Bancorp, 6.3%, and Republic New York Corp., 20%.
Shawmut National Corp.'s profit rose 13-fold.
The earnings gains were basically in line with Wall Street expectations, and the market, as has been typical recently, found the news reason to take profits.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, BankAmerica common stock fell $1.125, or 2.4%, to close at $46.50 a share; PNC common fell $1, or 3.4%, to $28.125; Fleet, Providence, R.I., fell 62.5 cents, or 1.8%, to $33.75; NBD fell 12.5 cents to $29.25, and Shawmut, Hartford, Conn., fell 75 cents, or 3.2%, to $22.875.
But Republic New York common climbed 12.5 clents, or 0.3%, to close at $48.75, and Norwest common rose 62.5 cents, or 2.6%, to $24.75.
In spite of the market's unenthusiastic response, Wall Street analysts found reasons to be happy about the reports, particularly the continued improvement in asset quality.
"Credit quality is improving to an amazing extent," said Christoph M. Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co.
Nonperforming assets at Pittsburgh-based PNC fell by $67 million during the quarter to $554 at year end.
Norwest's nonperforming assets declined to $235 million from $325 million a year earlier.
Detroit-based NBD's nonperforming portfolio was $269 million at year end, compared with $352 million a year before.
Thanks to credit improvements, several banks reported sharply lower credit-loss provisions.
At San Francisco-based BankAmerica, the provision dropped to $150 million from $178 million in the third quarter, reflecting new stability in the state's long-depressed economy and property markets.
At Minneapolis-based Norwest, the provision declined to $40 million from $112 million a year earlier.
Most of the banks, as have others, continued to report a gradual decline in net interest margins, or the difference between a bank's cost of capital and the rate it earns on loans.
Norwest's margin was 5.45% in the fourth quarter, down from 5.70% a year earlier.
But for most banks, higher loan volumes boosted interest income.
At PNC, for example, total loans climbed 11% from a year earlier.
"Margins are coming down, but loan growth has been better than I expected it would be," Mr. Kotowski said.
BankAmerica was an exception to the trend: Although average loans outstanding rose to $124.8 billion from $121.8 billion, net interest income declined to $1.86 billion, down $16 million from the third quarter, largely because of the deterioration in margin, which fell to 4.66%, down eight basis points from the third quarter.
A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.
