American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s venture capital arm has taken a small equity stake in TopoMetrix Corp.
The move is part of a deal under which TopoMetrix will exclusively develop and market an AT&T technology for ultra-powerful microscopes.
Based in Santa Clara, Calif., TopoMetrix, a privately held microscope maker, will license AT&T Bell Laboratories' patents on the near-field scanning optical microscope.
It also will acquire an AT&T company, NanoVision Corp., formed in 1992 to commercialize the invention.
Although financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed, Shirley Clayton, TopoMetrix's vice president of finance, said AT&T Ventures would end up with a stake of "somewhat less than 10%" in TopoMetrix.
Near-field scanning optical microscopes, which are over 10 times more powerful than other optical microscopes, are expected to be used in making advanced semiconductors, mapping human genes and other scientific fields.
