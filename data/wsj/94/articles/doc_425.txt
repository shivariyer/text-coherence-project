UAL Corp. said it filed with federal regulators documents related to the proposed $5 billion employee buyout of the company, naming some director nominees and detailing the mix of securities in the transaction.
The parent of United Airlines said it will next file a preliminary proxy statement and prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The majority-stock purchase by employees then goes before shareholders for a vote.
Once the transaction is completed, the company will have a 12-member board.
The company said it chose Joseph V. Vittoria, chairman and chief executive officer of car-rental concern Avis Inc., to represent salaried and union employees.
And UAL confirmed that two of the four independent directors are John K. Van de Kamp, former attorney general of California, and Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Their names have surfaced recently as board candidates.
The other independent directors are Duane D. Fitzgerald, chairman and chief executive officer of Bath Iron Works Corp., and Richard D. McCormick, chairman and chief executive officer of telecommunications concern U S West Inc.
UAL will retain three of its current directors as well.
The buyout transaction, which United's pilots and machinists unions have valued at $173 a share, will be accomplished through a recapitalization.
For each UAL share held, existing shareholders will receive one-half share of new common stock, and a package of securities and cash valued at $88.
UAL's machinists and pilots unions, along with its salaried employees, will exchange more than five years' worth of wage and work-rule concessions for at least a 53% stake in UAL.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL shares closed at $133.25, up $1.75.
