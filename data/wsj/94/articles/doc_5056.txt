Standard & Poors Corp. lowered its credit ratings for Volkswagen AG and Fiat SpA, saying the two beleaguered auto makers face a rough road in their restructuring efforts.
Citing the European market slump, excess capacity and continuing pressure from Japanese auto makers, S&P lowered VW's commercial paper rating to A-1 from A-1 plus, and cut VW's senior debt rating to A-plus from double-A-minus.
S&P took VW off its CreditWatch list.
An S&P spokesman said VW has a strong balance sheet, with only minimal debt.
Still, S&P said, "The rating outlook is negative, given the extent of Volkswagen's cost problems and uncertainty over the adequacy of remedial actions."
VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech has projected a loss of $1.35 billion for 1993.
As for Fiat, S&P cut its commercial paper ratings to A-2 from A-1, dropping the Italian auto concern out of the top tier of commercial-paper credit risks.
That likely will raise Fiat's borrowing costs.
However, Fiat doesn't rely on commercial paper financing to the same extent as the U.S.
Big Three auto makers do, an S&P spokesman said.
Fiat has estimated a loss for 1993 of about $1.6 billion.
"Fiat's competitive position is weak," S&P said in its statement.
The rating concern added that "continued success" for Fiat's aggressive new product development program will be "critical if the company is to stabilize its market share in Italy."
