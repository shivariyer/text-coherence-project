Jan. 31, 1994
The erratic pace of job growth that kept economists guessing for most of 1993 has smoothed out and the pace is expected to stay on its steady, upward path for the rest of the year.
Nonfarm payroll jobs fluctuated wildly from month to month for the first three quarters of 1993 before settling into a groove of 160,000-200,000 a month, starting in September.
A Labor Department report this week probably will show the economy picked up another 200,000 payroll jobs in January, said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Bank Corp. in Pittsburgh.
"We expect to see a fairly broad-based rise, with increases in manufacturing, construction, mining and service industries," he said.
Manufacturers, who have been reluctant to hire full-time employees ever since the recession, probably took on an additional 10,000 to 20,000 workers in December, according to Mr. Hoffman.
For all of 1993, just under two million payroll jobs were generated "and we expect to see further progress in the job market in 1994," he said.
The Labor Department report also should show continued containment of wage costs, one of the main factors in controlling inflation, Mr. Hoffman said.
