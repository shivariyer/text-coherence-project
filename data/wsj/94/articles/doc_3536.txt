GKN PLC confirmed that pretax profit for 1993 fell 20% from 1992 as a result of higher exceptional costs and the most severe fall in European car and commercial vehicle production on record.
GKN provided earnings estimates in early February when it launched a hostile bid for the remaining shares in Westland Group PLC that it doesn't already own.
Pretax profit fell to #97.5 million from #121.8 million in 1992, as costs from layoffs ate into the results.
GKN also confirmed plans to proceed with the 1-for-5 rights offering of its ordinary shares at 480 pence ($7.15) to raise #248 million to help fund its acquisition of Westland.
Chairman Sir David Lees said European automotive markets remain weak and there is no sign of real improvement as yet.
The outlook for the U.K. and North America continues to improve, he said.
