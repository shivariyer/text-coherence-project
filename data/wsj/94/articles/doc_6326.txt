Walter V. Shipley, chairman of Chemical Banking Corp., estimated that the New York-based bank holding company will earn $1.20 to $1.25 a share in the first quarter and $4.90 to $6 a share for all of 1994.
Chemical earned $1.35 in the first quarter of 1993, and $5.77 for the full year.
The first quarter of 1993 included a 14-cent-a-share gain from an accounting adjustment.
In a speech at an American Bankers Association conference in New York City, Mr. Shipley also said the Federal Reserve Board's action Friday, raising the federal funds' rate at which banks lend funds to each other, wouldn't significantly affect Chemical's earnings.
Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chemical closed at $37.25, up 25 cents, on volume of 1.8 million shares.
