The Senate confirmed President Clinton's nomination of Pentagon lawyer Jamie Gorelick to the No. 2 job at the Justice Department.
Also confirmed was Boston lawyer Deval Patrick to head the department's civil rights division.
Both were confirmed by voice vote.
Ms. Gorelick, the general counsel at the Defense Department, will become deputy attorney general, succeeding Philip Heymann.
Mr. Heymann resigned in January after a dispute with Attorney General Janet Reno.
The department's No. 3 official, Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell, resigned last week in a dispute over billings at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark.
President Clinton hasn't named a successor.
