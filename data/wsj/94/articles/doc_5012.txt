Tejas Gas Corp. said a subsidiary will build an 85-mile, 24-inch-diameter gas pipeline in Texas.
Construction costs weren't disclosed.
A spokeswoman for Tejas, a natural-gas pipeline company, said it hasn't yet announced which unit will build the pipeline.
Tejas plans to have the pipeline operating by this summer.
The pipeline will connect Tejas's gas-gathering system southeast of Laredo, Texas, to a unit's system southwest of Corpus Christi, Texas.
Tejas operates more than 5,200 miles of pipeline in the U.S.
