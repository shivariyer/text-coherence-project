Monk-Austin Inc. stock jumped 17% as the company reached an agreement in principle with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. to buy tobacco for RJR's domestic operations beginning in 1994.
The agreement will add between $200 million to $300 million annually to Monk-Austin's revenue beginning in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, the company said.
Monk-Austin's revenue for the year ended June 30, 1993, was $611.4 million.
The pact doesn't require R.J. Reynolds, the domestic tobacco unit of RJR Nabisco Holding Corp., to buy a minimum quantity of tobacco, Monk said.
Monk-Austin's stock closed at $18.50, up $2.625, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Monk-Austin's profit margin on the additional revenue will be less than the company's overall margin on its other tobacco business, because overseas it takes more of a risk on the success of crops and on holding inventory and crops, according to P. Lee Thornton III, vice president and treasurer.
The RJR agreement will be the largest single source of business for Monk-Austin, a tobacco buyer and processor.
The outsourcing is part of a cost-cutting program at R.J. Reynolds.
Last fall, the company announced plans to trim its work force by about 1,200 workers.
In a similar step last fall, R.J. Reynolds contracted its media buying to an outside company.
Leigh Ferst, Prudential Securities tobacco analyst, said the tobacco outsourcing may be RJR's first step toward contracting out tobacco processing as the U.S. tobacco market shrinks.
