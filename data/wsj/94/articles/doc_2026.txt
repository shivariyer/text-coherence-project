Compania de Telefonos de Chile SA said a decree from Chilean regulatory authorities setting its tariffs for regulated services for the next five years would hurt its 1994-1998 business plan.
The telephone company's American depositary receipts are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
The ADRs were last quoted at $100.50, off $15.75, or 13.5%, as trading was halted at midday and did not resume.
In a news release, the company in Santiago, Chile, said it asked its general comptroller to declare the proposed decree not legal, since it contains elements not included in the technical economic basis or in the law.
