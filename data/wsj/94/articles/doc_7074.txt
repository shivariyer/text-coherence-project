Two House committee chairmen asked the Comptroller of the Currency to take the unusual step of seeking public comment on the proposed purchase of Dreyfus Corp. by Mellon Bank Corp.
Comptroller Eugene Ludwig must approve the merger of Dreyfus's mutual-fund business into Mellon's retail-banking operations, but Democratic Reps. John Dingell of Michigan and Henry Gonzalez of Texas said they want Mr. Ludwig to give the deal a wider airing.
Mr. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said he will schedule hearings on the transaction.
Rep. Dingell and Rep. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, want Mr. Ludwig to brief them on the acquisition before he approves it.
The two chairmen have questioned the transaction, focusing on the ability of federal banking regulators to adequately assess the securities activities of banks.
Yesterday, the two chairmen asked for more documents and information from Mellon, Dreyfus and Mr. Ludwig.
A spokesman for Mellon said the bank will respond to any questions and said it is confident the acquisition of Dreyfus will be approved and completed.
