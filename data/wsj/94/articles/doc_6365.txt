Citing charges associated with its acquisition of ChipSoft Inc., Intuit Inc. posted a fiscal first-quarter loss of $167.2 million, or $13 a share.
Scott Cook, Intuit's chief executive officer, said the loss had been expected since the company agreed to acquire ChipSoft in September.
"There's no surprise here," he said.
Mr. Cook said Intuit is expected to post net losses "every quarter for three years" because of accounting write-offs related to the merger.
However, the company is expected to remain profitable on an operating basis.
Total merger-related charges for the fiscal first quarter, ended Dec. 31, were $181.6 million, including $151 million related to purchased research and development that hadn't yet reached technological feasibility.
Intuit, a maker of popular programs for personal and small-business finance, agreed to acquire ChipSoft, a producer of consumer tax-preparation software, in a stock swap valued at $281 million.
In September, Intuit said it expected to take a charge against earnings of about $100 million related to the acquisition.
However, Mr. Cook said the "good news is that we were able to write off more assets in the first quarter than expected."
Excluding merger-related charges, Intuit said it earned $8 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $3.1 million, or 29 cents a share.
Sales in the quarter rose to $60 million from $33.2 million a year before.
On an operating basis, the company beat analysts' expectations.
According to Zacks Investment Research Inc., analysts had expected Intuit to earn between 35 cents and 40 cents a share.
