CompuServe Information Services, the on-line computer network, said it will offer access to the global computer network known as the Internet.
The unit of H&R Block Co. said it will begin rolling out Internet features to its 1.7 million members later this year.
Members will be able to log into remote computers on the Internet and download software and files.
They also will be able to access thousands of bulletin boards that range in topics from programming languages to one called "Sexy Bald Captains" on "Star Trek" actor Patrick Stewart.
CompuServe declined to say how much it will charge for the new service or when its members would be linked up.
But, CompuServe said, Internet users will be able to connect into CompuServe through the global network by the end of this month.
Internet users won't be able to use CompuServe's software that makes it easy to use.
Currently, rival services such as America Online Inc. and Prodigy Services Co. are planning to add Internet features.
But among the five major online services, only Delphi Internet Services, a unit of News Corp., offers full access to Internet.
