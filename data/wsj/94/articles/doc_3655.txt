Microelectronics & Computer Technology Corp., a private consortium to pool U.S. technology research, said its Chairman and Chief Executive Craig I. Fields will resign effective June 1.
Mr. Fields couldn't be reached immediately for comment but said in a statement that he had grown tired of commuting between MCC headquarters and Washington, where his wife is a computer-systems specialist.
"In the next phase of my life, my wife and I are determined not to be separated by our careers," he said.
A search for a new CEO is under way.
Mr. Fields joined MCC in 1990 after heading the Defense Department's research arm.
For MCC, formed in the 1980s to counter Japanese advances in leading-edge research, his departure comes at an awkward time.
Facing criticism that much of MCC's research was irrelevant and expensive, Mr. Fields in recent months launched initiatives to sharpen its focus, including a venture-capital subsidiary to spin off MCC technologies and a nationwide computer network for member companies to swap information with suppliers and customers.
Bill Stotesbery , a spokesman for the consortium, said those efforts won't be affected by Mr. Fields's departure.
"MCC is solid," he said.
Mr. Fields, 47 years old, had been director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, where he was an outspoken proponent of more government involvement in policies to boost U.S. competitiveness.
Those views, however, caused friction between Mr. Fields and his Bush administration bosses, who reassigned him to another Pentagon post.
