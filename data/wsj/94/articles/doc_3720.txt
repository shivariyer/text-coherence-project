Loral Corp. completed its purchase of International Business Machines Corp.'s Federal Systems Co. unit for $1.52 billion.
The acquisition brings New York-based Loral's total funded backlog of contracts to be performed to about $6 billion, including Federal Systems' substantial Pentagon and government contracts providing systems integration and technology for military avionics, electronic combat, space programs and communications projects.
The company is awaiting completion of a government-led review process that provides federal oversight when a contract for government services is passed from one provider to another.
The review is led by the Defense Department, which provides 60% of Federal Systems' $2.2 billion in annual revenue.
The company also performs work for other agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration, which hired Federal Systems to perform a sweeping upgrade and consolidation of air-traffic control systems.
The Internal Revenue Service recently awarded a $1.3 billion contract to Federal Systems for help converting taxpayer-filed tax forms into electronic images, starting in 1996.
