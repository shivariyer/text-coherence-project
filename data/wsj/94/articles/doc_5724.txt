Standard & Poor's Corp. said it would include Pacific Telesis Group and its PacTel Corp. unit in the S&P 500 Index following the unit's spinoff.
The ratings agency said Pacific Telesis sold 14% of the unit in December and plans to sell the remaining 86% by the end of the second quarter.
PacTel, it added, will have an estimated market value of $12 billion, or 50% of Pacific Telesis' market value before the spinoff.
S&P said it would announce the removal of a company from the index closer to the date of the spinoff.
