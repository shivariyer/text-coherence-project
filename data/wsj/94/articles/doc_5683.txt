Attorney General Janet Reno named Jo Ann Harris as acting deputy attorney general to temporarily succeed Philip Heymann, whose resignation takes effect today.
Ms. Harris will continue her duties as assistant attorney general for the criminal division until the Senate confirms someone to succeed Mr. Heymann.
Jamie Gorelick, currently the Pentagon's general counsel, is the leading candidate for deputy attorney general.
Until a permanent deputy is selected, the management division, which normally reports to Mr. Heymann's office, will report to Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell, who generally oversees the department's civil matters.
The management division is responsible for the department's budgetary and personnel matters.
A department statement said the reporting shift was done "to more equitably distribute the workload" while Ms. Harris runs the criminal division and the deputy's office.
