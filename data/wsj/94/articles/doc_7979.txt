An influential member of Congress predicted that tensions between the U.S. and North Korea over inspections of the Asian nation's nuclear program will escalate this year.
"I believe that sometime this year you will see a confrontation that, hopefully, will end peacefully, and we will prevail," said Rep. John Murtha, chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee.
"The first test of this administration is going to be Korea," the Pennsylvania Democrat told reporters at a breakfast meeting.
"Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia are nothing compared to Korea."
Mr. Murtha said he is worried that the North Koreans have been using their negotiations with the U.S. as a delaying tactic while they develop nuclear weapons.
"That's very dangerous because it could lead to world-wide proliferation," Mr. Murtha said.
