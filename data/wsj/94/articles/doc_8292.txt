M.I.M. Holdings Ltd. said its Canadian subsidiary plans to sell its 12.7 million shares of Granges Inc., representing 37% of total shares outstanding, for at least four Canadian dollars (US$3.05) a share, or a total of C$50.8 million (US$38.8 million).
Under an agreement between the companies, Australia-based M.I.M. said Granges has the right for 30 days to find a purchaser for the shares at a comparable price.
After that, M.I.M. will be free to sell the shares for about three months.
Granges is a Toronto mining concern.
A Granges spokeswoman said an independent board committee will study the matter and suggest a course of action.
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Granges closed at US$3 a share, down 12.5 cents, amid general weakness in mining shares.
