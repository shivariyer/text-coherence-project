Japan's stock market latched on to rumors of a speedy end to the nation's current political turmoil, but there was no public evidence of any settlement.
The ruling coalition, stunned by the parliamentary setback last week of its political-reform bills, drafted a compromise proposal Wednesday to draw support from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party.
A special committee designed to discuss the plan, however, adjourned after just five minutes with no negotiation on the issues.
The committee is scheduled to meet again Thursday, but LDP leaders aren't making any encouraging noises.
"We haven't reached a consensus" within the party, Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary-general, said.
In the political-reform negotiations, the coalition's compromise proposal included watering down restrictions on corporate campaign contributions and changing the composition of the new electoral rules to be more favorable to the LDP.
Economic policy and other matters have ground to a halt in this week's political-reform struggle.
If the coalition fails to revive the legislation by the end of the parliamentary session Saturday, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa may resign or may call snap elections.
Such fears triggered a sharp drop in the Tokyo market earlier this week.
Hours before Wednesday's failed committee meeting, rumors swept the stock market that a pro-reform faction of the LDP was ready to cut a deal.
Foreign buying, in particular, led the Nikkei 225-stock index to close at 19138.21, up 489.85 points, or 2.6%.
