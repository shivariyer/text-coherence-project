Swedish automotive and industrial group AB Volvo said its board has decided to carry through a new share issue announced last fall as a prerequisite to the acquisition of Sweden's Branded Consumer Products AB.
The seven-billion-krona share issue ($889.7 million) would allow for the swap of one newly issued Volvo share for every six BCP shares.
Volvo's directors also proposed a 5-for-1 stock split.
BCP was created in November 1993 through the split of former food and drug conglomerate Procordia AB into two companies -- biotechnology and pharmaceutical group Pharmacia AB and BCP, active in food, beverage and tobacco products.
A decision on approval of the new share issue will come at Volvo's general annual meeting next month.
Since the swap offer for BCP shares was first made in October, the price of Volvo shares has risen more than 200 kronor a share, with Volvo B closing in Stockholm at 630 kronor ($80) yesterday.
To reflect the jump in Volvo prices, the new share issue underlying the BCP offer has been boosted to seven billion kronor, or 104 kronor a BCP share, from 4.7 billion kronor, or 71 kronor a BCP share, the group said.
BCP shareholders have two other options under the terms of the offer, the group said.
For each BCP share tendered, they can opt to receive a cash payment of 47 kronor, or 0.35 Pharmacia share.
However, local analysts noted these two options aren't likely to find many takers, as BCP Series A and B shares are both trading at 103 kronor yesterday, with Pharmacia A at 119 kronor and Pharmacia B at 120 kronor.
Volvo currently owns 73.7% of BCP's shares.
As of Dec. 31, these shares were shown in Volvo's consolidated accounts at 6.1 billion kronor, the group said.
The offer is not available to BCP shareholders in the U.S. and Canada.
