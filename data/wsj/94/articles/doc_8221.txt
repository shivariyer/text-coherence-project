Electronic Data Systems Corp., entering the gambling business for the first time, agreed to acquire a stake in Video Lottery Technologies Inc. for $67.6 million.
As part of its agreement with Video Lottery, Dallas-based EDS is to manage the computer systems that the Bozeman, Mont., company supplies to state lotteries.
About 600 Video Lottery workers will become EDS employees.
The computer-services concern, a unit of General Motors Corp., will also collaborate in Video Lottery's development of lottery computer systems.
The investment by EDS, amounting to about a 20% stake in Video Lottery, will consist of convertible preferred and common stock, for which EDS agreed to pay $27.50 a share.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday, Video Lottery shares jumped $1.50, or 7.6%, to $21.25.
GM shares linked to EDS rose 75 cents to $29.25.
EDS's move, unusual for a company whose customers come largely from the ranks of big corporations, could lend stability to Video Lottery.
In October 1992, Larry Lippon resigned as Video Lottery's chairman and chief executive because of an inquiry that linked him to two criminals.
The proceeds from EDS's investment will allow Video Lottery to reacquire, through an investment group acting as an intermediary, the bulk of Mr. Lippon's remaining stake in the company.
After resigning, Mr. Lippon had given the investment group an option to buy the shares.
