Ryland Group Inc. said it could narrowly miss analysts' estimates of first-quarter profit because of poor weather, but it expects to post stronger results in 1994.
Its new chief executive and president, R. Chad Dreier, said he expects Ryland to build 9,000 homes in 1994, up from 8,050 last year.
The home builder, of Columbia, Md., said poor weather may "make it difficult" to achieve analysts' first-quarter estimates of between $4 million, or 22 cents a share, and $4.5 million, or 25 cents a share.
But earnings "won't be significantly off," Mr. Dreier said.
In the yearago first period, Ryland had net of 38 cents a share.
The chief executive said he was comfortable with analysts' profit estimates for 1994: Ryland is expected to earn between $28.7 million, or $1.85 a share, and $32.5 million, or $2.10 a share.
In 1993, the company had a loss of $2.7 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of $1.47 billion.
