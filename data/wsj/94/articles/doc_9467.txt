Phillips Petroleum Co. said it plans to leave the catalyst business with the sale of facilities owned by units in Ohio and Texas.
Phillips, Bartlesville, Okla., recently completed the sale of the operating assets of its Aztec Catalyst Co. unit to Laporte Inc., the U.S. unit of Britain's Laporte PLC.
Aztec, Elyria, Ohio, produces catalysts used in the plastics industry.
Phillips also signed an agreement to sell its Catalyst Resources Inc. unit in Houston to Mallinckrodt Specialty Chemicals Co. of St. Louis, a unit of Imcera Group Inc.
Terms of the two sales weren't disclosed.
Phillips has been trying to improve financial performance by boosting cash flow, reducing expenses and selling more than $600 million of assets since 1991.
