Capital Holding Corp., Louisville, Ky., said it expects to take a first-quarter charge of 20 cents to 36 cents a share for its "impaired investment" in Granite Partners, a limited partnership that invested in mortgage-backed securities.
The company, which provides consumer financial services including insurance, consumer loans and annuity and pension products, said it was difficult to assess the portfolio's value with any more precision due to the "illiquid nature of the underlying securities."
Capital, which has $22.9 billion in assets, had investments in Granite valued at $52.4 million at year end and said it only was made aware of the fund's deteriorating position within the past several days.
For the 1993 first quarter, Capital reported net income of $65.8 million, or 64 cents a share.
The company described its investment in Granite as one of 10 small programs it runs through outside fund managers to diversify its investment-risk profile.
