Ameritech Corp. plans to spend $4.4 billion over the next 15 years to build a full-service network capable of carrying an array of interactive services to customers across its Midwest territory.
"This is the platform that positions us to serve five to six million customers" by the end of the decade, Richard Brown, Ameritech's vice chairman said.
But the $4.4 billion blueprint amounts to a conservative course for the company at a time when other regional telephone companies have unveiled bigger and bolder plans.
Ameritech nonetheless said it intends to deliver video services to a million homes by the end of 1995, starting out with parts of Chicago, Milwaukee and Detroit.
The $4.4 billion is in addition to $24.6 billion over 15 years that the Chicago-based Baby Bell has said it will spend to upgrade its network -- for an average of $1.64 billion a year.
Ameritech has spent an average of $2 billion a year for the past decade on network upgrades.
