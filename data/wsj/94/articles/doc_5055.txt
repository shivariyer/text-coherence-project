French chemical and drug group Rhone-Poulenc SA said group net income fell 36% to 962 million francs ($163.8 million) in 1993, reflecting poor business conditions, mainly in Europe.
For 1992, the recently privatized company reported profit of 1.52 billion francs ($258.8 million).
In the latest period, revenue fell 1.4% to 80.56 billion francs from 81.71 billion francs a year earlier.
Rhone-Poulenc confirmed its intention to reduce its net dividend to 2.4 francs (41 cents).
That compares with the net dividend of three francs for voting shares -- after a 4-for-1 share split in the interim.
The profit decline reflected poor conditions in the chemicals and fiber business, restructuring provisions and the impact on agriculture chemical demand from the reform of European Union agricultural policy.
