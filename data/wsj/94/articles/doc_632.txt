NationsBank Corp. paid $10.4 million in 1993 to a construction company headed by the son of Hugh L. McColl Jr., NationsBank chairman and chief executive officer, according to the bank's preliminary proxy statement.
The payment was part of a contract between the giant bank holding company and Shelco Inc., which is constructing a 400,000-square-foot office building for NationsBank in Greensboro, N.C. Hugh L. McColl III, son of Mr. McColl, serves as chief executive officer of privately held Shelco, based jointly in Charlotte and Winston-Salem, N.C.
According to the proxy, "neither Mr. McColl nor his son had any participation in the negotiation or arrangement of this contract."
The proxy adds that Shelco received no higher payment than an "unrelated party rendering similar services" would receive.
Both NationsBank and Shelco declined to elaborate on the contract.
In a statement issued last May when the construction project was announced, NationsBank said the development, including the building and the land, would cost $30 million.
The building, scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 1994, will be owned and occupied by NationsBank, the company said.
