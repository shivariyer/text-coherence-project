Ciba-Geigy AG announced a 17% rise in 1993 profit.
Chairman Alex Krauer described the performance of the big Swiss pharmaceutical-chemical company as "gratifying," and said he was "confident" of a "convincing performance and good results in 1994."
Net income for 1993 rose to 1.78 billion Swiss francs ($1.25 billion) from 1.52 billion francs in 1992.
Sales rose 2% to 22.65 billion francs from 22.2 billion francs.
This is the third year that Ciba has recorded double-digit profit growth since earnings plummeted 34% in 1990.
Ciba has streamlined operations to cut costs and better focus its health-care, agrochemical and industrial chemicals operations.
Ciba's health-care sector, which includes drugs, self-medication, diagnostics and eye care, recorded the highest sales growth with a 6% increase to 9.2 billion francs.
Health care has the biggest share of sales and accounted for about 68% of operating profit.
