A subsidiary of insurer Unum Corp. will be among the first corporate investors to buy a stake in Lloyd's of London to help rescue the British insurer from mounting losses.
Duncanson & Holt, a New York-based reinsurance underwriter, will invest at least $6 million to bolster the finances of the 300-year-old institution, Unum said.
By pledging the capital, Duncanson & Holt will be able to participate in the underwriting of about twice that much in insurance premiums.
