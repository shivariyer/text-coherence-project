Passengers are increasingly resisting airlines' requests for volunteers to leave overbooked flights, government figures suggest.
Airlines had to force 50,840 passengers off of flights last year, an 11% increase from 1992, according to the Transportation Department.
The chances of being "bumped" rose for the first time since 1985, and they rose even though planes were less full than they were the previous year.
Anticipating that some passengers won't appear, airlines routinely overbook flights.
If too many people show up, an airline typically offers inducements such as free-travel coupons until enough passengers agree to depart.
In 1993, 631,780 passengers left planes voluntarily, a drop of 13% from 1992, according to the Transportation Department.
If airlines have to bump passengers involuntarily, they must pay passengers an amount equal to the ticket fare, up to $200.
If the passenger arrives at the final destination more than two hours late, the compensation doubles.
And courts have upheld a passenger's right to sue an airline for financial losses after being bumped from a flight.
David Swierenga, chief economist for the airlines' Air Transport Association, said the risk of being bumped will be greater this year if air traffic increases even slightly because airlines have shed planes to cut costs.
"You'll have more flights operating at 100% capacity," he said.
