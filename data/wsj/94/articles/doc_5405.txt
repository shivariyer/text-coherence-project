Andre Rousselet, chairman of France's Canal Plus SA, stepped down yesterday as the head of the pay-TV operator in a disagreement over the reshuffling of stakes in the group.
Mr. Rousselet, who resigned late last week from the board of Havas SA, will recommend to Canal Plus's board at a meeting tomorrow that Pierre Lescure succeed him as chairman, Canal Plus said.
Following Mr. Rousselet's departure from the Havas board, there was strong speculation that he would resign as chairman of Canal Plus.
Mr. Rousselet took issue with Havas's decision to combine its 23.5% stake in Canal Plus with the 20.1% owned by France's Cie. Generale des Eaux.
Mr. Rousselet stormed out of a Havas board meeting last week following the decision, which he apparently viewed as a threat to his autonomy.
Mr. Rousselet is a founder of Canal Plus, which began operations in 1984.
After the company got off to a fitful start, Mr. Rousselet two years later negotiated a favorable broadcasting license from the government that greatly improved the pay-TV company's fortunes.
