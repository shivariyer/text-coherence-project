OHM Corp., Findlay, Ohio, said it received two contracts from the U.S. Air Force to remediate hazardous waste sites at three U.S. bases.
The environmental remediation concern said both contracts are indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity-type contracts with a base year plus four option years that may be extended at the Air Force's option.
OHM said it is "reasonable" to expect the potential value of the contracts to be $110 million over five years.
Under the first contract, OHM is one of six contractors chosen to compete for an estimated $80 million a year of remedial projects at Hill Air Force Base, Ogden, Utah.
Under the other contract, the company is one of four companies competing for an estimated $38 million a year of remedial projects at Tinker Air Force Base, near Oklahoma City, and Eglin Air Force Base, Mary Ester, Fla.
