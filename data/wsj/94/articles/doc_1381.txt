Waxman Industries Inc. said it extended until Friday its offer to purchase all, but not less than $66 million, of the $98.8 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 13.75% senior subordinated notes due June 1, 1999.
Waxman, Bedford Heights, Ohio, supplies plumbing, electrical and hardware products to the home-repair and remodeling market in the U.S. and Canada.
The notes are to be purchased for $1,065 per $1,000 principal amount, together with interest accrued up to but not including the payment date.
Waxman said the tender offer was originally set to expire yesterday.
The company said the offer was extended to better coordinate the completion of the offer with Waxman's debt refinancing, which it anticipates will close on March 31.
All other terms of the tender offer remain the same, the company said.
At the close of business on last Friday, about $75 million aggregate principal amount of the notes had been tendered, Waxman said.
