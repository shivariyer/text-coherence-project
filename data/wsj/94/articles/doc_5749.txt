Firstar Corp. said it definitively agreed to acquire closely held First Southeast Banking Corp. for stock currently valued at $54.7 million.
Milwaukee-based Firstar will issue just over 1.8 million common shares of its stock to effect the acquisition of the Lake Geneva, Wis., bank holding company.
The acquisition of First Southeast, which has assets of $423 million, provides Firstar with "significant presence" in the Racine, Kenosha and Walworth county markets of Wisconsin, Firstar officials said.
Firstar has assets of $13.8 billion.
Completion of the transaction is expected this summer, following regulatory approval, Firstar said.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Firstar shares closed down 37.5 cents at $30.375.
