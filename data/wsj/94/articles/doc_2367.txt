FMR Corp., the holding company for the nation's largest mutual-fund manager Fidelity Investments, reported net income soared 80% last year to $225 million, assets under management rose 36% to $258.4 billion and operating revenue rose 46% to $2.66 billion.
James Hanbury, a financial-services analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co. called the assets increase by closely held FMR "extraordinary" and said it was well ahead of the 25% growth for the industry.
In a letter to shareholders, Edward C. Johnson III, FMR's chairman and chief executive officer, called 1993 "an exceptional year" with record sales of mutual funds and brokerage trades.
He said the company also "overcame some of the resistance" to selling mutual funds wholesale to brokers, banks and other financial intermediaries.
But Mr. Johnson cautioned the company's heavier phone and processing volumes required investments in systems, staffing and facilities.
And "it remains to be seen whether we accomplished any true gains in productivity," he said.
Attributing FMR's success to the rising stock market, he added that "it will be especially important for us to remain flexible enough to reduce overhead during the stock market's next down cycle."
Mr. Hanbury noted that Fidelity's indicated operating profit margin of 8% is low for the mutual-fund management industry, in which he said after-tax profit margins last year generally ranged from 15% to 25% of revenue.
FMR said 1993 marked a record in its three-year aggregate performance of its funds, which it said outperformed 84% of their peers on an asset-weighted basis between 1991 and 1993.
It said its stock funds beat 90% of their competitors; fixed-income funds outperformed 69% of their peers; high-income funds surpassed 78% of their peers; and money-market funds beat 85% of their peers.
