DuPont Co. said a Florida jury ruled in its favor in a lawsuit brought by two blueberry growers, who alleged that the company's Benlate DF fungicide product had harmed their crops.
The trial in the 10th Judicial Court in Polk County began Jan. 3, the chemical concern said; the plaintiffs had been seeking $8 million in damages.
DuPont said the jury ruled that "there was no product defect and no negligence on the part of DuPont," and called the verdict a "major trial win in its battle to vindicate" the controversial Benlate product.
Attorneys for the two growers couldn't be reached late yesterday.
DuPont still faces hundreds of lawsuits from farmers, plant-nursery operators and the like, who contend that the fungicide hurt their crops.
The company recalled the granulated form of Benlate in late 1991, and later paid out nearly $500 million in Benlate claims.
But it halted such payouts in November 1992, asserting that tests it sponsored had proved the product couldn't have caused the damage the plaintiffs allege.
Since then, the company has either gone to court over such claims, or settled privately.
In the cases that have gone to trial, DuPont has had a mixed record.
For the most part, in cases where it has been ordered to pay damages, plaintiffs have received much less than they had been seeking.
In one federal court case, the plaintiffs settled while the jury was deliberating.
In the latter part of 1993, one Florida court found the company liable for $3 million in damages to an orchid grower, and another jury ordered DuPont to pay $3.2 million -- far less than the $28 million plaintiffs had been seeking -- to certain nursery owners.
An Arkansas jury found the company liable for $10.7 million in another case, but DuPont also won a Texas bench trial and has succeeded in getting some other complaints thrown out.
