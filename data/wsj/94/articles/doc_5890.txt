The state of Oklahoma and the state's Department of Securities each filed a civil suit in Oklahoma County District Court against three brokerage houses, seeking $6.7 million in alleged excessive profit from bond trading for the state.
The Oklahoma Attorney General's office said the charges stem from a series of transactions involving the purchase and sale of U.S. Government securities by the Oklahoma state treasurer's office.
The suit named Planners Independent Management Inc., San Diego; Mabon Securities Corp., New York; and Adler Coleman Clearing Corp., New York; along with three individual agents of Planners Independent Management.
A spokesman for the Oklahoma Attorney General's office said the plaintiffs in the two cases are seeking to consolidate their actions.
A recently completed state audit found allegedly unethical trading practices and claimed that securities firms had overcharged the treasurer's office by more than $6 million.
Among the allegations made by the state and securities regulators: buying and selling securities at unfair prices by applying excessive markups and markdowns; depriving the state of the best available market price; and allowing or receiving payments when no services were performed.
