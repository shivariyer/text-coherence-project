Commodore International Ltd., a once highflying personal computer maker, warned that it is on the verge of collapse and could be liquidated unless it secures new funding.
In releasing a quarterly earnings report, the maker of the Amiga computer said it is attempting to negotiate a restructuring plan with creditors, including suppliers that have sued the company.
The release did not describe the nature of the lawsuits, and the company did not make a spokesman available.
In its earnings report, Commodore said, "In the absence of additional resources and a restructuring, the company may become subject to reorganization or other liquidation proceedings."
Commodore's Amiga PC, first released in the mid 1980s, never caught on among mainstream computer users, though it was praised by computer magazines for its easy-to-use features.
For the second quarter ended Dec. 31, Commodore had a loss of $8.2 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a loss of $77.2 million, or $2.33 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue fell to $70.1 million from $237.7 million.
Commodore stock fell 12.5 cents to $3 in New York Stock Exchange trading.
