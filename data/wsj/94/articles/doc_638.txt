Hershey Foods Corp. said it expects operating earnings for the first quarter to fall below the $64.5 million, or 71 cents a share, of the 1993 first quarter.
The Hershey, Pa., chocolate, food products and restaurant concern said an early Easter holiday and the timing of some year-end promotions shifted sales back to the 1993 fourth quarter.
Bad weather also hampered sales in the 1994 first quarter.
The 1993 first-quarter net income of $1.1 million, or one cent a share, included accounting changes and a gain on the sale of the company's Freia Marabou investment.
The company said there are signs the confectionary market is resuming stronger growth.
About 90% of Hershey's worldwide sales relate to the confectionary business.
While earnings may shift on a quarterly basis, Hershey expects "another good year" in 1994.
