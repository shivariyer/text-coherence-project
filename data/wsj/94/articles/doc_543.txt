Santa Fe Energy Resources Inc., Houston, said it put the financial part of its broad restructuring plan in place, filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an offering of $100 million of senior subordinated debentures and 10.7 million dividend-enhanced convertible shares.
The company, which went public in 1990, has been struggling with low earnings for several quarters.
In the fourth quarter, it had a net loss of $83.1 million, or 95 cents a share, on revenue of $102.6 million.
The loss included a $99.3 million write-off of oil-and-gas properties and a $38.6 million restructuring charge, both pretax.
Santa Fe in October said it would sell noncore assets and speed up development in its three core domestic areas.
It also eliminated its quarterly dividend of four cents a common share.
Santa Fe said the senior subordinated debentures will be due in 2004.
The convertible shares will pay a quarterly dividend prior to conversion or redemption, be convertible into common stock at the holder's option and will convert automatically about four years after issuance.
The company can redeem the shares a year before the automatic conversion at a call price payable in common shares.
Salomon Brothers Inc. is one of the lead underwriters of the debenture offering.
