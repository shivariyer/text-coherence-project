Defense contractor Grumman Corp. announced its restructuring plan to reduce operating cost by nearly $600 million over the next three years.
As expected, the company said it will close five major Long Island, N.Y., facilities, trimming total manufacturing and office space by one third.
The current work force of 17,900 people, already down from a 1987 peak of about 33,000, will be reduced by about 500 this year.
Grumman said it will take a pretax charge of $85 million against 1993 earnings to cover the restructuring cost.
Excluding the charge, Grumman said 1993 earnings will be "at least in line" with 1992's $3.49 a share from continuing operations.
Among specific locations affected, aircraft operations in the 1.5 million-square-foot facility at Calverton, N.Y., will be moved to Grumman's plant in St. Augustine, Fla.; engineering and technical operations in Calverton, Woodbury, Melville, and Holtsville, N.Y., will be moved to the company's headquarters in Bethpage, N.Y.; and a detail parts facility, a manufacturing enginering lab and office building, all in Bethpage, will be closed.
Most Bethpage employees will be offered transfers, the company said.
