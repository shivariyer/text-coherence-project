ValueVision International Inc., adding pressure to its hostile $140.8 million offer for National Media Corp., said it plans to launch a proxy fight at the target company's March annual meeting.
ValueVision in Minneapolis, which currently holds an 8.6% National Media stake, will ask the target company's shareholders to seat a new slate of eight directors committed to its takeover bid.
The move by the third-largest U.S. home-shopping network, follows a rebuff last week from National Media's board, which asked stockholders to reject the $10.50-a-share cash-and-stock tender offer.
Directors at National Media, a Philadelphia television-marketing concern, labeled the offer inadequate.
ValueVision wouldn't speculate on the outcome of the proxy vote, but a spokesman said, "We continue to feel that our offer is appropriate.
We're going to put it to the shareholders."
National Media did not return phone calls requesting comment.
