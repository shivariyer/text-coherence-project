You apparently got a little carried away in your editorial diatribe against the Clinton FY 1995 budget ("Spend Like an Egyptian," Feb. 8), searching for the metaphorical Rosetta Stone and other means to decipher the document.
Maybe your problem was in your "parsing the numbers."
To my knowledge, numbers cannot be parsed, only words can.
