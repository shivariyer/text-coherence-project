Trafalgar Square, meet Tex-Mex.
Gene Street, chief executive of Good Eats Restaurant Group Inc. of Dallas, last week received long-sought approval to open the Texas Embassy Cantina in London in August.
Mr. Street and his partners, Dallas lawyer A. Hardcastle and Midland oilman Russell Ramsland Jr., have wanted to open a Mexican-food restaurant in London for three years -- ever since they visited the city and found the Mexican cuisine lacking.
At one of the restaurants, says Mr. Street, "their burritos were flour tortillas with Fritos and chili wrapped up and rolled together."
But getting all the necessary approvals wasn't easy, particularly since some locals feared a tacky Tex-Mex on the edge of Trafalgar Square, home of the famed National Gallery art museum.
The site -- a 90-year-old bank building -- isn't far from No. 10 Downing Street, the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace.
"When I saw it, I said, `great building, but they're never going to let a Tex-Mex restaurant come in this area,' " Mr. Street recalls.
And, in fact, there was resistance.
Officials and neighboring property owners were concerned about potential traffic and noise, while representatives of the Queen questioned whether the company's flag (a near-replica of a Texas Ranger badge) might offend her majesty if she was taking a stroll.
"They are very concerned about flying flags over there," Mr. Ramsland says.
The restaurant's investors, who number about 20, will shell out about $2 million to turn the bank building into a restaurant, Mr. Ramsland says.
They expect at least $6 million in annual sales, although they believe $8 million to $12 million is more likely.
"I think with a good product, with lots of margaritas and a lot of marketing, we're really going to have a big deal," says Mr. Street.
"I think Texas will be proud of it."
