Bond prices soared after another government report showed that inflation remains in check.
Stocks and the dollar were mixed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.44 points to 3848.15.
The index of 30 blue chip stocks was up more than 15 points at one stage during the afternoon, but a big computer-guided sell program hit the industrial average a minute before the market closed, robbing it of 13.55 points, according to Birinyi Associates, a financial-services firm.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index climbed 2.41 to 469.42, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 5.47 to 798.99.
Stock prices gained as the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond dropped to 6.79% from 6.87% Tuesday.
Behind the bond market rally was a Labor Department report showing consumer prices climbed 0.3% last month.
The core rate of inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, also rose 0.3%.
"Whether you look at the total CPI or the core rate on a year-to-year basis, the inflation rate is 0.3 percentage point below last year's," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C.J. Lawrence.
"That suggests last year's good inflation news is not over."
Still, Mr. Yardeni conceded that it may take several more months of favorable inflation reports before bond investors are convinced enough to push interest rates sharply lower.
"The market is locked into the perception that inflation is going to get worse rather than the reality that inflation is improving," he said.
"At some point, the evidence is going to be too compelling to ignore."
World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.42 to 116.46.
Stock prices were mixed.
Volume totaled 306.1 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,346 issues advanced and 803 declined.
Bond prices rallied.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue rose nearly a point, or almost $10 for each $1,000 face amount.
The dollar was mixed.
In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.6885 marks and 106.07 yen, compared with 1.6965 marks and 106.00 yen Tuesday.
