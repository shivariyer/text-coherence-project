Siemens Medical Systems Inc. agreed to stop producing medical devices at three facilities until the company corrects manufacturing problems.
"Siemens was getting complaints and basically ignoring them," said Don McLearn, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration.
The company, based in Iselin, N.J., is a subsidiary of the multinational company Siemens AG, based in Germany.
The U.S. company signed a consent decree stating that such devices as hearing aids, ultrasound monitors, pacemakers and patient monitors were improperly made and that Siemens didn't adequately address consumer complaints, according to the FDA.
The agency said the company also had inadequate quality-assurance programs.
Siemens maintained that violations didn't involve the safety and effectiveness of its products, and that the problems stem mainly from "procedural and record-keeping issues."
Mr. McLearn said that by signing the decree, however, Siemens is taking full responsibility for the problems the FDA found in the manufacturing procedures.
The three Siemens facilities in question are in Concord, Calif.; Danvers, Mass.; and Issaquah, Wash.
The company also was required to correct problems at facilities in Sylmar, Calif., and Piscataway, N.J., and two foreign sites.
In addition to correcting those, according to the decree, Siemens has 18 months in which to ensure the safety of the rest of its foreign operations to the FDA.
"We are hopeful of a speedy resumption of shipments from the affected facilities," Siemens said.
