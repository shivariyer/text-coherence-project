NCR Corp., in a bow to its acquisition by American Telephone & Telegraph Co., changed its name to AT&T Global Information Solutions.
Jerre Stead, chief executive officer of the Dayton, Ohio, company that AT&T acquired in a hostile takeover in 1991, said it was time to drop the NCR name to better reflect its moves into computing, information networking and systems integration.
He said that AT&T's survey of clients showed that they still identified the NCR name too much with the former cash-register business of the company, which was started late in the 19th century as the National Cash Register Co.
