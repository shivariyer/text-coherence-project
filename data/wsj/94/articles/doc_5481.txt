Cap Gemini Sogeti SA, the French computer software and services group, estimated that it will post a loss of 434 million francs ($72.9 million) for 1993, widening from a 72 million franc loss in 1992.
Cap Gemini noted that the 1992 loss would have been 333 million francs without a 261 million franc capital gain on the sale of some Paris real estate.
Cap Gemini also announced plans to boost its capital resources by 1.5 billion francs.
Its parent company, Sogeti SA, is expected to subscribe to the issue at a proportion equivalent to its 61.5% stake.
And the software group said it has decided to intensify efforts in 1994 to dispose of nonessential assets.
Those efforts recently resulted in the sale of stakes in Sweden's Jacobson & Widmark, as well as Carelcomp in Finland, and France's Copernique SA.
Looking ahead to this year's performance, Cap Gemini said an anticipated improvement of economic conditions should allow the group to "progressively return to growth and profitability."
Meanwhile, in Germany, Cap Gemini announced plans to merge CAP Debis with Debis Systemhaus.
It said the merger would reinforce cooperation between Cap Gemini and German partner Debis.
Cap Gemini said 1993 consolidated revenue is estimated at about 11 billion francs, down 7.4% from 11.9 billion francs the previous year.
Cap Gemini didn't specify last year's operating profit, although the company noted that it dipped to about 2% of revenue, from 2.9% in 1992.
The figure is after amortization of goodwill.
After years of acquisitions, and fivefold revenue growth between 1985 and 1992, Cap Gemini has been hit by the downturn in the computer industry and the recession in general.
