J.P. Bolduc was named a director of this gold company and of its 90.1%-owned subsidiary, Newmont Gold Co., filling seats being vacated by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith.
Mr. Bolduc, 54 years old, is president and chief executive of W.R. Grace & Co.
Sir James, 61 years old, said he resigned as director to avoid potential conflicts of interest, because he accepted an invitation to co-lead a national slate in France for the European parliament.
