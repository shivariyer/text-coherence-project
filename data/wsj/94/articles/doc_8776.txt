Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest bank holding company, said 1993 earnings rose 35% to 3.59 billion pesos ($1.16 billion) from 2.66 billion pesos in 1992, as a result of strong trading profits and stronger fee income.
The company's Series L shares, those typically owned by foreign investors, rose 3.2% to 25.40 pesos yesterday on Mexico's stock exchange.
Expenses climbed for the year in nearly every category for the company, known as Banacci, but higher costs were more than offset by strong increases in fee and trading income.
Banacci said noninterest income more than doubled in the fourth quarter because of the big rally in Mexican stocks after the approval of the North American Free Trade agreement, among other things.
For the year, noninterest income was up 29%; fee income rose 26%.
But Banacci continues to have trouble with past-due loans, which rose 17% on a gross basis during the quarter, according to Catherine Murray, bank stock analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities.
"Asset quality is still an issue," she said.
