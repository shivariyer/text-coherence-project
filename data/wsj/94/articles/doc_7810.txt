Stock prices climbed, buoyed by the prospect that interest rates are likely to stay steady.
Bond prices rose and the dollar fell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.66 points to 3908.00 in heavy trading.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 2.28 to 473.20, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 2.41 to 788.80.
Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at CS First Boston, said stocks started rallying on the prospect that interest rates were likely to remain stable or even move lower.
One of the reasons investors were so hopeful about rates is that the Dow Jones Utility Average, which some analysts consider a leading indicator of interest rates and stock prices, surged.
After slumping in recent weeks, the index of 15 utility stocks soared 3.49 points to 221.46.
"The feeling is that interest rates are not going to the moon because the utility average had a strong day," said Mr. Applegate, adding that expectations that rates would stay low encouraged many investors to snap up financial stocks such as banks.
