Rally's Hamburgers Inc. reported a loss for the fourth quarter, including a charge of $11.9 million to close 26 restaurants and restructure the business.
For the quarter, the burger chain reported a net loss of $10.1 million, or 77 cents a share, compared with net income of $2.8 million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue increased 33% to $45.2 million from $34 million.
The company, based in Louisville, Ky., said the restructuring primarily resulted from the intense competition among burger restaurants.
Analysts have expressed concern that the chain expanded too quickly and was ill-prepared for the burger price wars.
Still, the company expects to open 45 to 55 new company-owned units in 1994, and its franchisees are expected to open 45 to 50 new restaurants.
As of Feb. 17, Rally's had 523 restaurants operating in 23 states.
