Fonar Corp. introduced two new magnetic-resonance, or MR, imaging machines that it said can halve what a patient currently pays for a diagnostic scan by such a machine.
The company said the machines will also make it possible to do certain diagnostic imaging that had been economically prohibitive, such as a mammogram.
Mammography is currently done using an X-ray machine, which costs patients about $80 to $100, substantially lower than the $800 or so an MR scan would cost, said Raymond Damadian, president.
The new MR machines, capable of producing a better picture than an X-ray, can "deliver mammograms at $80," he said.
The machines are priced at $650,000 and $1.1 million.
They would compete against MR machines made by General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn., Siemens AG of Germany and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands, among others.
Phil Drew, a medical-equipment consultant in Concord, Mass., said Fonar's timing is "pretty good."
He said the Clinton administration's pressure to reduce health-care costs, along with other factors, has resulted in a sharp drop in sales of MR machines, especially the most powerful ones, which are the most expensive.
"Fonar is in the right part of the imaging market with lower-cost machines," he said.
The Fonar machine's lower cost doesn't derive from new technology but from its carousel configuration, which reduces the time between patients.
Dr. Drew, the consultant, said at least one major medical-equipment manufacturer some 10 years ago tried but abandoned the carousel approach in a computed tomography, or CT, scanner.
He said that even if it works this time, whether it results in lower costs to patients will depend on "there being enough patients" to create the necessary volume.
