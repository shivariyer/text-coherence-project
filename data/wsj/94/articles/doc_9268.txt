ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG, a German retailer, said it sold 10% of its home-improvement chain Praktiker Bauund Heimwerkermaerkte AG to the Hirsch group, a private company.
An ASKO spokesman declined to comment on the purchase price.
ASKO still owns 75% of Praktiker and said it intends to seek a stock-exchange listing for it in the summer of 1995.
The remaining 15% of Praktiker was acquired last year by a banking consortium led by Deutsche Bank AG and Berliner Bank.
The company had said at its shareholders meeting last year that it planned to sell part of Praktiker.
In a statement yesterday, Klaus Wiegandt, chairman of ASKO's management board, said this represents "a further important step in the implementation of our medium-term strategy to concentrate on core business" and make operations more independent.
The Duesseldorf-based Hirsch group is involved in real estate and investments.
It isn't part of the Hirsch AG textile firm, also based in Duesseldorf.
