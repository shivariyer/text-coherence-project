Apple Computer Inc., hoping to maintain sales as it prepares to launch another line of personal computers next month, said it cut prices in the U.S. between 7% and 18% on Macintosh Quadra computers.
In addition to the price cuts, Apple said U.S. customers buying selected Quadra computers with qualifying printers can receive a $150 mail-in rebate.
These incentives follow Apple's recent assurance that Macintosh Quadra systems currently sold will be easily upgraded to PowerPC, the new chip developed by Apple, Motorola Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. that Apple is using to power its new line of Macintoshes.
Analysts have said Apple customers might defer purchasing a new computer until the PowerPC Macintoshes come out, leaving existing product unsold.
In an effort to induce sales that has been successful, Apple cut prices repeatedly over the past year, making the Macintosh more competitive.
Apple also lowered prices as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system enabled rival IBM-compatible computers to emulate the Mac's look and feel.
Apple's latest price cuts included computers on the higher and lower ends of the Quadra line.
For example, the price of Apple's lower-end Macintosh QuadraAV with a 230-megabyte hard drive was cut 18% to $1,879 from $2,289, and the price of its higher-end Quadra 800 with a 1,000-megabyte hard drive was reduced 7% to $3,789 from $4,089.
