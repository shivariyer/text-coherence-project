British Aerospace PLC, the U.K. engineering and aviation group, said 580 jobs would be cut at its Avro International division in 1994.
The company said that the Avro regional-jets business is still undergoing reorganization, and that the job losses are a result of this.
The international marketplace for jets continues to be in recession, British Aerospace said.
