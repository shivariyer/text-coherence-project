Swedish insurer Foersaekrings AB Skandia said it swung to a 2.01 billion krona ($250.8 million) operating profit in 1993, the best operating result in the group's history, because of improvement in insurance and investment operations, as well as better income from associated companies.
Skandia's 1992 loss was 3.24 billion krona.
Skandia also announced a 3 billion krona rights issue aimed at existing shareholders.
Definitive terms of the share issue, Skandia's first since 1978, will be decided at a meeting of its board on March 23 and will be subject to the approval of the annual general meeting on April 14.
