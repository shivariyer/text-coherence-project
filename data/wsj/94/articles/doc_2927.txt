CoreStates Financial Corp. said it agreed to acquire Germantown Savings Bank of Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., for $260 million in stock and cash.
Under the agreement, each of Germantown Savings' 4.19 million shares would be exchanged for cash, CoreStates shares, or a combination, valued at $62.
CoreStates said the transaction will consist of 55% stock and 45% cash and shareholders may elect how to receive their proceeds.
If either portion is oversubscribed, the excess would be allocated on a pro rata basis, CoreStates said.
The news sent Germantown Savings stock up $3.50, or 6.5%, to $57.25 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
CoreStates stock fell 50 cents to $24.50, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
CoreStates said it also received an option to purchase up to 19.9% of Germantown stock, a step typically taken to discourage hostile offers, if the acquisition does not go through as planned.
This is the fourth in a series of acquisitions by CoreStates, a bank-holding company with $23.7 billion in assets and 280 branches.
CoreStates said the acquisition would strengthen its share of deposits in the five southeastern Pennsylvania counties where Germantown has its 32 branches.
The acquisition of the $1.6 billion bank, is subject to approval by banking regulators and Germantown Savings shareholders.
CoreStates is also in the process of acquiring Constellation Bancorp of New Brunswick, N.J.; Independence Bancorp of Perkasie, Pa., and Rittenhouse Financial Services Inc. and Rittenhouse Trust Co.
