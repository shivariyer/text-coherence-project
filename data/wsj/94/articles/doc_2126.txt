Standard & Poor's Corp. raised or affirmed its ratings on Citicorp and a number of its units, affecting about $18 billion of debt.
The ratings concern said the changes reflect progress the banking company has made in improving its financial strength.
Ratings raised include senior debt to single-A from single A-minus, and subordinated debt to single A-minus from triple B-plus.
Citicorp preferred stock was raised to triple B from triple B-minus.
S&P said Citicorp has returned to sustainable levels of profitability and rebuilt its capital and reserves to levels within industry norms.
In addition, a heavy burden of problem loans is being steadily worked down.
"More importantly, management is seeking to implement a disciplined method of risk control to prevent such problems from recurring.
The bank benefits from extraordinary diversity, by product line and geographically, with operations around the globe.
It is an industry leader and innovator in a multitude of very profitable banking businesses, such as credit cards and various trading and capital markets activities."
As a result, S&P said, Citicorp "continues to have the earnings base and financial flexibility to withstand periods of adversity, as it has through the real-estate and Latin American lending difficulties of the last decade."
Still, S&P said it expects Citicorp to continue to build capital and reserves.
S&P said the ratings should remain stable until the bank demonstrates success in reorienting its internal structure and managing risk.
