The State of Wisconsin Investment Board said it will oppose an executive-compensation plan and a proposal to create two new classes of stock at SHL Systemhouse Inc. of Ottawa.
The Madison, Wis., pension fund, which owns about 9.1% of the computer-service company's 52.8 million shares, said the two proposals together could potentially dilute the holdings of SHL stockholders by about 37.5% over the next three years.
"I've never seen a plan with this much dilution in it over such a short period of time," said John Nelson, director of investments for the pension fund.
Shareholders are to vote on the proposals at the Feb. 17 annual meeting.
John R. Oltman, chairman of SHL, defended the compensation plan, calling it "critical" to the company's success.
In its proxy materials, SHL Systemhouse said it could save $21 million during the next three years by replacing its current cash-incentive and stock-option plans with a proposed "executive equity plan."
Mr. Oltman called criticism of the proposed two new classes of stock "unfounded".
