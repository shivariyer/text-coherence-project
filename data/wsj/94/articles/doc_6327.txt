U.K. food supplier Dalgety PLC reported nearly flat earnings for its fiscal first half ended Dec. 31, and meanwhile the company cut prices for ingredients sold to some U.S. restaurants.
For the half, Dalgety reported pretax profit rose 0.4% to #56.4 million ($83.1 million) from #6.2 million.
But earnings per share dropped 7% to 17.2 pence (25.3 cents) from 18.5 pence due to an increase in its tax rate.
U.S. retailers have called for price cuts, said Chief Executive Richard Clothie.
Dalgety has negotiated price concessions with growing restaurants to make up for lower profit margins with higher sales.
Profit in Dalgety's U.S. distribution unit Martin-Brower Co. has grown, but not as fast as sales.
Dalgety said operating profit at the unit rose 16% to #8.1 million for the six months.
Sales rose 24% to #1.46 billion ($2.15 billion).
