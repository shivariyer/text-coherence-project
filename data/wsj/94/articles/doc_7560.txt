Schering-Plough Corp. said strong sales of new allergy drugs helped to lift fourth-quarter earnings 13% to $188.9 million, or 98 cents a share, from $167.7 million, or 84 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales rose 7.2% to $1.07 billion from $994.4 million.
For the full year, the Madison, N.J., drug company had net income of $730.8 million, or $3.75 a share, up 1% from $720.4 million, or $3.60 a share, in 1992.
The 1993 results included a charge of $94.2 million, or 48 cents a share, for a noncash accounting change for retirement benefits.
Without the charge, the company said earnings would have grown 18%.
Sales rose 7% to $4.34 billion from $4.06 billion.
Schering said sales would have risen 9% excluding the effects of foreigncurrency exchange.
Schering said its domestic sales of prescription drugs rose 10% in the year, led by its new Claritin medicine for hay fever and its Vancenase line of allergy products.
It expects that 1994 "will once again produce solid earnings growth."
