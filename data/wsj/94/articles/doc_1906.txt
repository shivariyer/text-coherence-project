General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division, looking to stop a decade-long sales slide, yesterday priced its redesigned 1995 Lumina family sedan $780 or more below its best-selling rival, the Ford Taurus, and unveiled new advertising to go with the new car.
Both moves are part of GM's effort to put its No. 1 selling brand back on track after several years of lackluster products and shopworn sales pitches.
The 1995 Lumina will hit showrooms in early summer with a base price of $15,995, compared with $16,775 for the cheapest Ford Taurus, the best-selling car in the U.S. for the past two years.
Adjusting for the fact that air conditioning is standard on the Lumina and optional on the cheapest Taurus GL, the new Chevrolet sedan's sticker price could be $1,000 to $1,500 less than a comparable Taurus, a Chevrolet spokesman said.
That sticker price comparison, however, doesn't necessarily reflect what consumers will really pay.
For instance, if Ford Motor Co. offers an aggressive lease deal, as it has in the past, consumers could pay less per month for a Taurus than for a new Lumina purchased at GM's "value" sticker price.
Honda Motor Co. has recently offered to lease its Accord family sedan for as little as $199 a month for two years.
To repair its image in advance of the new Lumina's launch, Chevrolet will rev up advertising under the new slogan "Genuine Chevrolet."
The theme replaces the six-year-old "Heartbeat of America" campaign that has been limping toward the exit for more than a year.
Chevy will officially launch its new image campaign tonight during CBS's coverage of the NCAA basketball tournament.
