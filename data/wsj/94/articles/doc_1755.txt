I wonder If Prof. Bruce Ledewitz realized that he used the phrase "illegal but essentially peaceful" three times during his Feb. 2 Rule of Law column "RICO's Latest Victim -- Social Protest."
I felt as though he were trying to convince either himself or the reader that what antiabortionists do at clinics is peaceful.
As he acknowledged, the antiabortion demonstrations go beyond the First Amendment and into property trespass.
I add that they also inflict emotional duress onto fellow human beings.
The abortion decision is not an easy one to make for most women -- it comes only after long hours of self-questioning, doubt and examination.
To be harassed at the end of such a journey is far from peaceful, whatever form the harassment takes.
Unfortunately, proponents of free choice have little to work with to help protect a woman's right to health care.
I hope that the near future will provide more tools for pro-choice people to use against these violators, so that using RICO will not be necessary.
The question of when life begins is a personal and often religious-based belief.
America was built to shelter people from having to live by anyone else's religious beliefs -- let's keep it that way.
