Hydro-Quebec has tentatively agreed to pay Inuit natives several hundred million dollars over 50 years if it builds the controversial Great Whale hydroelectric project in northern Quebec.
Hydro-Quebec, owned by the province of Quebec, and Inuit representatives declined to comment on terms of the agreement in principle, which hasn't been signed yet.
But Hydro-Quebec said it expects the signing to take place by early April.
A spokeswoman for the utility said Canadian media reports on the accord were broadly accurate.
According to a draft copy of the agreement, obtained from other sources, the Inuit would agree not to raise legal obstacles to the project.
They would receive 30 million Canadian dollars (US$21.9 million) when construction is approved and C$3 million a year during the seven-year construction period.
Afterward, they would get C$12 million a year for 42 years, with payments indexed to inflation.
The Cree natives of northern Quebec continue to oppose Great Whale, arguing that massive flooding from the project will harm their hunting territory and endanger their traditional way of life.
Total cost of the 3.2 million-kilowatt complex is estimated at C$13.3 billion.
Hydro-Quebec's plans call for it to begin operating in 2003.
But the project is subject to environmental reviews in Canada.
