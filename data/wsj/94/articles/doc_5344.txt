Huffy Corp. reported a loss in the fourth quarter and recorded a $20.3 million charge to cut 200 jobs and restructure operations at its True Temper Hardware Co. unit.
For the quarter, the maker of bicycles, basketball backboards and lawn and garden tools reported a loss of $17.9 million, or $1.26 a share, compared with a loss of $321,000, or two cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue declined 17% to $155.5 million from $186.7 million.
Without the charges, the company said 1993 fourth-quarter earnings would have been $2.4 million, or 17 cents a share.
The company attributed declining sales to the elimination of traditional year-end ordering incentives and emphasis on just-in-time orders, which is contributing to a slow start for 1994.
Huffy said operating profits improved due to better margins at the company's Recreation and Leisure Time Products group, which includes the company's bicycles and basketball backboards segments.
In restructuring its True Temper unit, Huffy took a $14.3 million charge to write down assets and goodwill, and a $6 million charge to cut jobs and eliminate unprofitable and marginally profitable product lines such as pruning tools and spreaders.
A spokeswoman said most of the job reductions would come from the closure of its Anderson, S.C., plant.
Huffy, with about 6,400 employees world-wide, said it will reduce the number of employees at True Temper to 600 from about 800.
The company added that it expects improved efficiency and savings will pay for the restructuring charges by the end of 1995.
For the year, Huffy reported a net loss of $4.9 million, or 38 cents a share, compared with net income of $4.2 million, or 33 cents a share, in 1992.
Revenue increased 8% to $757.9 million from $703.3 million in 1992.
In New York Stock Exchange trading, Huffy finished down 12.5 cents at $19.
