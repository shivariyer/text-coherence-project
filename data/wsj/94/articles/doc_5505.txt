Apparel maker Bernard Chaus Inc. reported a $8.5 million loss, or 46 cents a share, for the fiscal second quarter, which it attributed to sluggish sales and pricing pressure.
Josephine Chaus, chairwoman and chief executive, said apparel "did not participate materially in the overall increase in sales reported by retailers" in the quarter.
A year earlier, the company had net income of $126,000, or one cent a share.
She said the company's efforts to reduce inventory increased the proportion of sales made below standard selling prices.
However, the pricing strategy "did reduce our inventory to less than the same quarter last year and thereby lessen the potential impact on future quarters."
Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 31 fell 18% to $50.7 million from $61.6 million.
For the six months, the company had a net loss of $10.2 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net of $2.5 million, or 13 cents a share, including a tax benefit of $866,000.
Sales declined to $120.3 million from $125.8 million.
The company said it is moving to further reduce operating expenses, reducing the styles in the line, maintaining lower prices, reducing the quantity of merchandise manufacturered and "generally lowering the level of business required to break even."
The company said it is negotiating with bank lenders to modify borrowing agreements, and expects negotiations will be successful.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Chaus shares closed unchanged at $2 a share.
