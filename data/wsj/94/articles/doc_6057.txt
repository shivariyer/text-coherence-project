U.K. shipping and transport group Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Co. said yesterday that its Los Angeles-based subsidiary, Princess Cruises, has ordered two superliners costing a total of $680 million for service in North America.
The order was placed with Fincantieri, an Italian yard that has worked with P&O in the past.
Delivery of the ships is due in 1997.
