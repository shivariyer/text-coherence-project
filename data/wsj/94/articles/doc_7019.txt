Your Jan. 27 article that discussed the FASB's meeting on Jan. 26 may have confused your readers.
The board discussed several requests to delay the effective date of FASB Statement 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.
Instead of delaying the effective date, the board decided to simplify the statement so that it would be easier for creditors to implement.
We expect to issue a proposal within the next few weeks that in final form would eliminate the provision that describes how a creditor should recognize income on an impaired loan.
The simplification would not change the basic provision of Statement 114 and generally would affect only the classification of income (or expense) on impaired loans, not the total amount of income (or expense) recognized.
