The Clinton administration is looking for lawmakers to sponsor controversial legislation that would require telecommunications companies to ensure that calls can be tapped by law-enforcement officials.
Beyond that, the proposed bill would force phone companies -- including mobile phone companies and cable companies that offer phone service -- to provide "call set up" information that tracks a call through a maze of networks.
Privacy advocates, telephone companies and some lawmakers have expressed strong concerns that the legislation isn't needed or goes beyond its stated goal of allowing law-enforcement agencies to conduct wiretaps over advanced communications networks.
As phone networks evolve, they will be able to deliver a wide variety of video entertainment, information and shopping services, and the bill could possibly let law-enforcement agencies obtain vast amounts of personal information, said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Officials scheduled a White House briefing today to explain their proposal to long-distance and local telephone companies and equipment manufacturers.
A spokesman for American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said company officials "have not had a chance to evaluate the latest plan, but in the past we've said legislation is not necessary."
