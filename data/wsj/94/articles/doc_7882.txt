Frank Lorenzo will cut his controlling stake of his would-be carrier, ATX Inc., by bringing in new investors in an attempt to get the startup airline off the ground.
Odyssey Partners, a private New York investment firm, will invest $5 million, and an additional $7.5 million was raised in a private placement arranged by Kidder, Peabody & Co. and Savoy Capital Inc., Mr. Lorenzo's Houston-based venture-capital firm.
Those actions will cut Mr. Lorenzo's stake to about 24% from more than 70%.
Odyssey Partners will have almost the same amount as Mr. Lorenzo, and the other new investors each will have less than 10%.
The new investors will receive a new issue of convertible preferred stock that will aggregate to 58% of the company's equity and voting control.
The move appears designed to elicit an approval for ATX from the U.S. Transportation Department.
An administrative law judge for the department ruled last month that while ATX was financially fit, Mr. Lorenzo wasn't likely to comply with rules governing airlines.
ATX says the law judge's ruling is incorrect.
Stephen Berger, an Odyssey Partner, will become ATX's chairman, and the new investors will include former New York Gov. Hugh Carey; Disque D. Deane, former chief executive and chairman emeritus of Corporate Property Investors; William E. Johnson, former chairman and chief executive officer of Scientific-Atlanta Inc.
The three men also will be added to ATX's board.
Other new investors weren't identified.
ATX plans to start low-fare service in late spring to major East Coast cities.
