Comcast Corp. posted a narrower loss on strong growth in revenue and cash flow for the fourth quarter, largely because of gains in the number of cellular and cable-television subscribers.
The cable and cellular operator reported a loss of $39.9 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with a loss of $140.9 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier.
The recent quarter included a one-time charge of $17.6 million, or eight cents a share, for early redemption of debt.
Revenue jumped to $337.5 million, up 29% from the year earlier.
Cash flow, defined as operating profit before depreciation and amortization, rose 28% to $146.2 million.
Cash flow is a primary indicator of a cable company's health.
Meanwhile, the company said the value of its investments in new and emerging business opportunities has "grown considerably" and the future of the wireless communications business is especially promising.
