A U.S. district judge declared a Washington state law limiting congressional terms unconstitutional in a test case of the ability of states to restrict the service of federal lawmakers.
The decision is a victory for House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.), who brought the court challenge after Washington voters enacted the law by popular initiative in 1992.
Proponents of the measure, one of 15 such laws that states have passed, said they would appeal the ruling; the issue is expected to be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Judge William Dwyer held that the Washington law was invalid because it added qualifications for members of Congress beyond those spelled out in the U.S. Constitution.
The opinion is considered the first definitive ruling on the issue by a federal judge.
The Washington initiative prohibited incumbents from having their names listed on local ballots after specified lengths of service -- six years for House members and 12 years for senators.
Proponents had argued the measure was within states' power to regulate elections.
