Federated Department Stores Inc., riding steady gains in store sales, said net income for the fiscal fourth quarter rose 47%.
For the quarter ended Jan. 29, Federated reported that net income totaled $146 million, or $1.16 a share, compared with $99 million, or 78 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
Federated's gain was only slightly less for the quarter before a one-time $6.1 million, or five cents a share, charge related to early retirement of debt recorded in the year-earlier period.
Federated's results were modestly better than expected by analysts, who took note of efforts to rein in expenses and cut operating costs.
In yesterday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Federated shares closed at $23.875, down 50 cents.
Cincinnati-based Federated, which operates 219 department stores in 26 states under the names of Abraham & Straus, Bloomingdale's, and Burdines, among others, showed healthy gains in store sales.
Sales for the quarter grew 3.8% to $2.35 billion from $2.26 billion a year earlier.
Comparable-store sales -- a key indicator of sales from stores open at least a year -- rose 2.1% in the fourth quarter.
Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said profit exceeded expectations for the quarter, as did sales and expense controls.
The company said operating expenses as a percentage of sales dropped to 32.1% in the fiscal year ended in January, from 34.2% in fiscal 1992, and 35.5% in fiscal 1991.
Mr. Questrom said Federated in 1994 would emphasize increasing sales growth and reducing expenses further by way of expanded "applications of technology" throughout the company.
For the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, Federated's net income, including charges related to the prepayment of long-term debt in both fiscal years, rose 71% to $193.2 million, or $1.53 a share, compared with $113.0 million, or $1.01 a share, for the fiscal year ended in January 1993.
However, Federated's profit before charges grew less, about 48%.
For the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, Federated's earnings, before charges, totaled $196.8 million, or $1.56 a share, compared with the year-earlier profit, before charges, of $132.7 million, or $1.19 a share.
Sales for the fiscal year grew 2.1% to $7.23 billion from $7.08 billion for the year ended in 1993.
Federated's same-store sales for the fiscal year rose 1.9%.
