Federated Department Stores Inc. said Chaim Y. Edelstein, chairman and chief executive of its Abraham & Straus/Jordan Marsh division, resigned to pursue other interests.
Mr. Edelstein, 51 years old, wouldn't comment beyond the company's news release about his unexpected resignation.
He had been chairman of the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Abraham & Straus unit since 1985.
Federated said it expects to name a successor shortly.
Mr. Edelstein had been with A&S since 1978.
In 1992, Cincinnati-based Federated merged the headquarters operations of A&S and the Boston-based Jordan Marsh units in a significant cost-cutting effort.
Both retailers serve similar middle-class customer bases.
At the time, Mr. Edelstein, then chairman and chief executive of A&S, was named as head of the consolidated chains.
The most recent sales figures for the unit's 35 stores show that in the year ended Jan. 30, 1993, sales totaled $1.42 billion.
That was a 3% gain from a year earlier when sales reached $1.38 billion.
