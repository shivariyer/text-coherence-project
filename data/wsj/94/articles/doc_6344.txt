This being the age of the information superhighway, the Clinton administration said it is making copies of the new budget available by computer modem and on CD-ROM for the first time.
The CD-ROM version, with accompanying computer software, includes exact replicas of the documents transmitted to Congress.
It is available for $30 from the Commerce Department.
The line-by-line appendix won't be available on CD-ROM until later this month.
Copies of the Clinton budget are also available free from the Commerce Department's electronic bulletin board and on the Internet.
Old-fashioned paper copies are available from Government Printing Office in Washington or its bookstores around the country.
The basic budget is $19, the appendix $44, a separate volume of analyses $21 and a book of historical tables $15.
