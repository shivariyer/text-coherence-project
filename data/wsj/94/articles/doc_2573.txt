Good news on inflation sparked a rebound in bond prices.
Stock prices were mixed, as was the dollar.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 1.69 points to 3853.41.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.18 to 467.06, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.93 to 793.05.
The Federal Reserve Board, which roiled financial markets recently by raising fears of inflation, delivered a soothing message yesterday in its Beige Book.
The Fed's report on economic activity said inflation pressures were limited, and that the economy expanded moderately in the first two months of the year.
"The market was focused on one thing: What would the Beige Book say about inflation?" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
"The verdict is that inflation is not a problem, and that heartened both the bond and stock markets."
Though bond prices rose, bond traders were reluctant to celebrate.
Many fear that despite the positive inflation news the Fed still will boost interest rates again later this month.
The industrial average overcame a decline of more than 20 points early in the session to eke out its small gain.
Mr. Sohn said the stock market's tone remains somber as investors anticipate further increases in interest rates.
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index lost 0.43 to 115.17.
Stock prices were mixed.
Volume totaled 309.8 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,098 issues fell and 1,034 rose.
Bond prices rose.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue gained more than 3/8 point, or more than $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.83%.
The dollar was mixed.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.7025 marks and 105.80 yen compared with 1.7143 marks and 105.37 yen Tuesday.
