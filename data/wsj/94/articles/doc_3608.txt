Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered its credit rating on senior debt of Ethyl Corp. and removed it from its CreditWatch list.
S&P said it took the action because Ethyl's recent spinoff of its chemical business, Albemarle Corp., reduces the diversity of businesses from which its earnings flow.
S&P lowered Ethyl's senior debt rating to triple-B from triple-B-plus.
The Richmond, Va., maker of fuel additives, said the rating change wasn't surprising in view of previous conversations with S&P over the impact of the Albemarle spinoff.
