Amax Gold Inc., which hasn't been making money, said its board eliminated the company's regular quarterly dividend of two cents a share.
Mark Lettes, chief financial officer, said Amax will put the money saved -- $3.7 million a year -- toward an investment of about $310 million in new gold-mining projects in Alaska and Chile.
"We're trying to get to the next generation of projects and that's going to require a fairly sizable capital investment," he said.
The dividend elimination is part of a broader cost-reduction program, Mr. Lettes added.
The company recently moved its office to cut expenses, reduced staff at its Sleeper mine in Nevada by 10% and plans further cost-cutting, he said.
The gold producer had a loss of $104.2 million, or $1.34 a share, in 1993, after $87.7 million in pretax asset write-downs and a $15.2 million charge because of an accounting change.
In 1992, the company earned $11.5 million, or 16 cents a share, after a $1.5 million charge from an accounting change.
Amax Gold shares closed Friday at $6.875, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
