The holding company that owns Jefferson Smurfit Corp. said the big paperboard and packaging concern, taken private in a leveraged transaction more than four years ago, plans to go public through an initial offering.
Jefferson Smurfit Corp. is 50%-owned by Ireland's Jefferson Smurfit Group PLC.
The remainder is held by Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II LP, a limited partnership formed by Morgan Stanley & Co.
The two bought out the minority public stake in the U.S.-based company in 1989.
The holding company through which they own Jefferson Smurfit Corp., SIBV/MS Holdings Inc., said it had filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, covering a planned offering of 14.6 million common shares.
The underwriters -- Morgan Stanley, Kidder, Peabody & Co. and Salomon Brothers Fund Inc. -- will be granted an over-allotment option of an additional 2.2 million shares.
The holding company failed to say at what price it expects to offer the shares, however, or what stake in the company the planned offering would represent.
The disclosure was made late Friday, at a time when company officials couldn't be reached.
In addition to the equity offering, a subsidiary of Jefferson Smurfit Corp's Irish parent has agreed to purchase $100 million worth of common shares, the St. Louis-based holding company said.
The offering appears to be part of a major recapitalization effort for Jefferson Smurfit Corp.
The holding company, SIBV/MS, also said Jefferson Smurfit Corp.'s Container Corp. of America unit intends to file with the SEC a registration statement covering a concurrent public offering of approximately $500 million Series A senior notes due 2004 and $100 million Series B senior notes due 2002.
Both series of notes will be unsecured obligations of Container Corp., unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by Jefferson Smurfit Corp.
