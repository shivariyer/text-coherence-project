Potlatch Corp., citing manufacturing efficiencies, said it will shed 160 jobs through early retirement in its Idaho pulp operation.
That will result in a pretax charge of $10 million against first-quarter earnings.
Combined with costs from a February ice storm in Arkansas, and the cost of rebuilding a tissue machine in Idaho, the $10 million charge "will have a significant effect on our first-quarter earnings," Richard Madden, chairman and chief executive officer of the San Francisco company, said in a news release.
A spokeswoman wouldn't comment on what first-quarter earnings will be.
Results will be announced April 14.
In the year-earlier first quarter, Potlatch had a loss of $9.5 million, or 33 cents a share, after an accounting charge of $75 million and a one-time gain of $43.8 million for an accounting change.
After the cuts, the Idaho pulp operation will be run by about 674 workers.
