Procter & Gamble Co. and Cygnus Therapeutic Systems formed an agreement to develop smoking-cessation products, including nicotine patches.
The move is P&G's first foray into the $350 million industry.
P&G will make an investment in Cygnus and have exclusive world-wide marketing rights to products manufactured by Cygnus.
Specific terms weren't disclosed.
This is one of several alliances that P&G, with about $30 billion in annual sales, has formed with small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
P&G doesn't currently offer smoking-cessation products, which are typically obtained by prescription only.
However, Don Tassone, a spokesman for P&G, said the move into a new industry is consistent with P&G's goal of "bringing superior technologies to market."
Cygnus, Redwood City, Calif., makes advanced drug delivery systems, and its products include Nicotrol, a nicotine transdermal patch for smoking cessation.
As is the case with P&G, Cygnus typically develops and manufactures products and licenses the marketing to partners.
Craig Carlson, a Cygnus spokesman, said Johnson & Johnson owns North American marketing rights to Nicotrol.
Mr. Carlson said the alliance with P&G is for the development of "nicotine transdermal patches which are not the same as Nicotrol."
He added that the agreement is "for a minimum of two products."
P&G and Cygnus declined to discuss when the new products will be available.
Although smoking-cessation products generate $350 million in annual sales, Mr. Carlson said, many in the industry believe the Food and Drug Administration "may some day approve the sale of smoking-cessation products for over-the-counter sale, so the potential market is larger."
The announcment came after the close of trading.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, P&G closed at $59, up 25 cents.
Cygnus closed at $10.50, down 37.5 cents, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
