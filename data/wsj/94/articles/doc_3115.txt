Last week, we incorrectly identified Rep. Ron Mazzoli, a Kentucky Democrat, as voting against an immediate investigation of the House Post Office scandal.
He voted in favor, and in fact Rep. Mazzoli has often shown similar courage in going against his party's line.
In 1985, he bucked House leaders and voted with Republicans in a dispute over a contested Indiana House race.
Like many other Democratic moderates, Rep. Mazzoli has decided to retire this year.
