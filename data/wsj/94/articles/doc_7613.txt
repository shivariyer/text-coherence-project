Sanford C. Sigoloff, the corporate turnaround specialist whose nomination as California schools superintendent surprised education interests in the state, withdrew as a candidate for the post.
In a letter to California Gov. Pete Wilson yesterday, Mr. Sigoloff cited "partisan politics, combined with an educational establishment resistant to change" in his decision.
The withdrawal came shortly before scheduled legislative confirmation hearings in which Mr. Sigoloff, 63 years old, was expected to face heated examination from legislators about his apparent lack of experience in education and his business background.
Gov. Wilson, in accepting the withdrawal, nominated Mr. Sigoloff to a four-year term on the 11-member State Board of Education, where Mr. Sigoloff will again face a legislative confirmation process but likely far less resistance.
The board sets state education policy and curricula.
Mr. Sigoloff styled himself as "Ming the Merciless" for his use of cost-cutting tactics in bringing Wickes Cos. and other companies through bankruptcy proceedings.
Teachers' unions and other groups were strongly opposed to the nomination.
Mr. Sigoloff had said he planned only to fill out the remaining 10-month term in the empty schools superintendent position.
