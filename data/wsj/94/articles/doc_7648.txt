Republic New York Corp. is willing to pay depositors of Green Point Savings Bank even more than its previous offer if state regulators clarified the bidding rules.
Green Point is in a battle to convert from a mutually held to stockholder-owned company, raising over $750 million in equity in the process.
After stripping Green Point of sweetheart compensation for insiders, the New York State Banking Department this week approved Green Point's conversion plans and issued it a new charter.
But on Wednesday a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the conversion, at the request of certain depositors who filed suit challenging the conversion.
Yesterday Green Point appealed the restraining order, and a hearing was set for today.
State regulators rebuffed Republic's offer to purchase Green Point through a $250 million offer to depositors, calling the offer "illegal and impermissible."
But people close to Republic say regulators never cited specific statutes.
Now Republic is understood to be considering sweetening its offer if it can obtain clarification from state regulators.
A spokeswoman for New York State Banking Department did not return calls.
A spokesman for Republic declined comment.
A spokesman for Green Point said the Brooklyn-based savings bank "intends to remain independent."
If the restraining order isn't lifted by today, Green Point under a previous deadline would be forced to give subscribers of its shares an opportunity to modify or rescind their commitments.
That could further delay the conversion if a significant number of depositors withdraw their applications to purchase stock.
