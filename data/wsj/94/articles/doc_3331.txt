Standard & Poor's Corp. said it upgraded its rating on this copper company's senior debt to triple-B-minus from double-B-plus.
The rating on the company's subordinated debt and preferred stock was raised to double-B-plus from double-B-minus.
The outlook is "stable," the ratings agency said.
The total debt was about $400 million as of Dec. 31, S&P said.
S&P said the upgrades reflect Magma's cost reduction through higher copper output and productivity gains, which led to a "very competitive" cash-copper cost of less than 60 cents a pound at the end of 1993.
The ratings agency also cited Magma's increased ore reserves and expansion program funded by two preferred stock offerings.

About $400 million in debt is affected.
S&P cited Woolworth's poor fourth-quarter earnings.
