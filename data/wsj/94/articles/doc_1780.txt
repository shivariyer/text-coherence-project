Lewis B. Kaden, 51 years old, partner in the New York law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, was named a new director of this steelmaker.
The move increases the size of the company's board to 16 members.
Mr. Kaden had been designated by the United Steelworkers of America for consideration as a director, according to terms of last year's labor agreement between the union and the company.
