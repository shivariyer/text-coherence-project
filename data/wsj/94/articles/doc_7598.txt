Ranger Oil Ltd. joined the growing number of Canadian energy companies taking steps to ward off hostile takeovers.
The Calgary, Alberta, oil and gas producer said its board adopted a "shareholder bid approval plan," intended to give directors and shareholders time to assess offers for company shares and, "where appropriate," to fend them off.
Ranger announced the distribution of one right for each Ranger common share outstanding at the close of business yesterday.
Under the plan, Ranger said that if a person or group acquires 20% or more of Ranger's common shares, the rights will entitle the company's other shareholders to purchase additional Ranger shares at a 50% discount from the market.
Ranger said the plan is in effect, but requires shareholder confirmation at a May 10 annual meeting.
