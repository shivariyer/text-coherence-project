The Transportation Department offered ATX Inc., Frank Lorenzo's proposed new airline, a second hearing after ATX raised ethical questions about its first hearing.
The department said the new hearing was being offered to "assure against the appearance of bias."
After the first hearing Robert Barton Jr., an administrative law judge, recommended that the department reject the airline's application to offer scheduled airline service.
The airline subsequently charged that a staff member for the Transportation Department's public counsel in the case has a brother who is a member of the Air Line Pilots Association.
The pilots union is opposed to ATX.
The public counsel is supposed to represent the public interest in such proceedings.
Capt. Randolph Babbitt, president of the union, said he was "outraged" at the department's offer of a second hearing.
He said the "public record clearly and unequivocally demonstrates that Mr. Lorenzo fails on two of the three fitness tests required by law."
The two tests include managerial competence and a disposition to comply with rules.
The third test for fitness is financial wherewithal.
Mr. Lorenzo's ability to finance his venture has been unquestioned, and in January he brought in additional investors, cutting his 77% stake to below 30%.
David Kirstein, Mr. Lorenzo's attorney, said ATX hasn't decided whether to accept the offer of a new hearing, and is "considering all its options."
