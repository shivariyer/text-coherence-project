Japan's Toyoda Machine Works Ltd., a machine tools and auto-parts maker affiliated with Toyota Motor Corp., said Friday its pretax loss for the year ending March 31 will be around 3.5 billion yen ($33.5 million), smaller than an earlier forecast of 5 billion yen.
The company said its efforts to lower the purchase prices of production materials helped narrow this year's loss.
A year earlier, Toyoda had pretax profit of 2.56 billion yen on sales of 161.85 billion yen.
The company expects sales of 132.50 billion yen in the current fiscal year.
At the same time, Toyoda Machine Works announced that it decided to liquidate a subsidiary in France set up in 1985 to manufacture lathes and machining centers, a kind of industrial machinery used widely by steel makers.
Production at the Cholet plant about 300 kilometers southeast of Paris has been suspended since September 1992 amid the recession in Europe.
Having transferred part of its production capacity to a French concern, the company will shift its marketing and service operations to Toyoda Machinery & Engineering Europe, a newly established marketing subsidiary.
The liquidation of the French subsidiary will result in a one-time loss of 14 billion yen for Toyoda Machine Works, but it plans a roughly equivalent one-time gain by selling its shareholdings and from financial reserves, the company said.
