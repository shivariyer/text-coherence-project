Host Marriott Corp. said it agreed to sell the bulk of its senior-living centers to Health and Rehabilitation Properties Trust for $302.4 million.
The sale is part of a continuing Host Marriott plan to sell assets and purchase additional hotel properties.
Host said it expects to record a second-quarter gain on the sale if the deal closes in early June as expected.
Health and Rehabilitation, a health-care real estate investment trust based in Newton, Mass., said it will pay $302.4 million in cash for the properties.
In addition, the company will assume $17.6 million in debt.
A spokesman said the company hasn't decided how to finance the purchase.
The company said that Merrill Lynch & Co., which was involved in the negotiations between the parties, is expected to provide some of the financing.
The deal will boost its investment portfolio 63% to $836 million, the spokesman said.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the trust's shares fell to $15.875, down 37.5 cents; Host Marriott's shares were unchanged at $11.625.
The 14 facilities included in the sale package are leased to Marriott International Inc., which will continue to operate them.
The facilities offer a number of residential options to senior citizens, including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing care.
Host Marriott owns hotels, airport and toll-road-concession services, and 18 senior-living centers.
Its sister company, Marriott International, is a lodging and services management concern.
The two companies were formed last year with the split of Marriott Corp.
