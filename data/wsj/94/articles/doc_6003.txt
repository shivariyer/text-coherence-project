U.S. Long Distance Corp.'s chief financial officer resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company's accounting.
Stephen Deaton, 47 years old, left his posts as CFO and senior vice president after only seven weeks on the job.
Parris H. Holmes Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of the telecommunications company, said the resignation "is totally unrelated" to the SEC's informal inquiry.
In an interview, Mr. Deaton declined to say whether his resignation was linked to the SEC probe.
Mr. Deaton, previously chief financial officer for a Dallas venture-capital firm, had been named to the posts Dec. 20, five days after the probe was disclosed.
His predecessor, Mark Buckner, had resigned last August.
The company, which says it is cooperating in the investigation, maintains that its financial statements are fairly stated.
Mr. Deaton's departure follows by eight days that of Charles P. Johnson, an executive vice president in charge of the company's direct-dialing and operator-assisted operations, who resigned Feb. 1.
The resignation was announced after the Nasdaq Stock Market closed.
The company's shares closed at $11, down 87.5 cents, or 7.4%.
Two weeks ago, U.S. Long Distance said it expects to report a loss for its first quarter, in part because of accounting and legal costs related to the inquiry, which involves how the company accounts for certain receivables.
At that time, the company also canceled a planned offering of 1.6 million shares.
Though previously it had cited the SEC inquiry in delaying the offering, U.S. Long Distance said that its decision to cancel the offering wasn't connected to the inquiry.
U.S. Long Distance said it is searching for a successor to Mr. Deaton.
