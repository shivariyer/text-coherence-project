Glimcher Realty Trust said an underwriting group led by PaineWebber Inc. exercised an option to purchase 2,373,750 common shares from the company at $20.25 a share.
The option was granted to cover over-allotments incurred in connection with Glimcher Realty's recently completed initial public offering.
Glimcher Realty will receive about $45 million after commissions and underwriting discounts.
The proceeds will be applied to reduce debt under the Columbus, Ohio, company's $100 million credit facility to about $33 million from $78 million.
The net proceeds received by the company from its IPO, including the exercise of the over-allotment option, were $342.2 million, which has been applied partially to the acquisitions of shopping centers and to the reduction of debt.
Glimcher is a real estate investment trust recently formed to continue the business and operations of Glimcher Co.
