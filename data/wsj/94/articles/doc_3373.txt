Your Feb. 17 article "In Skate Design, the Wheels of Progress Have Frozen Axels" pictured the passive role of the U.S. Figure Skating Association in the development of new skating equipment.
I shared with your reporter my experience as the former director of the USFSA's sports science program.
Because I was associated with the USFSA until 1989, I was discussing matters relating only to the old administration.
I was surprised to find quotations of what I had said transformed to the present tense, because more than once I pointed out the recent changes in the USFSA administration and its new approach to the old problems.
I am taking this opportunity to wish good luck to the USFSA.
