The French Economics Ministry delivered what appeared to be a rap on the knuckles Friday to the chairman of Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine for remarks related to the oil company's impending privatization.
A preliminary placement began Thursday, but the share price and the date of the offer period haven't been announced.
In a testy communique that mentioned no names, the ministry said: "Following assorted information appearing in the press, the minister stresses that the date for launching the public share offer of Elf Aquitaine shares hasn't been fixed yet."
The ministry said the price of Elf shares will be set at the start of the public offer, by order of the Economics Ministry, adding that "any indication on the price preliminary to the decision of the Privatization Commission and the ministerial order should be considered null and having never existed."
Philippe Jaffre, picked by the government from Credit Agricole to help prepare for the sale of the state-controlled oil company, reportedly said on France 2 television Friday, "I think the price of the shares will be known in two weeks."
Looking at earlier privatizations, the early placement for Rhone-Poulenc SA was announced Oct. 27 and the operation started Nov. 16.
The Elf operation is scheduled to start by April 20 at the latest.
Elf shares closed Friday down 3.3 francs (56 cents) at 418.5 francs ($70.80) a share on the Paris stock exchange.
The spokesman at Elf said no one at the company could confirm Mr. Jaffre's statements, nor would anyone comment on the communique.
But a ministry source said that Mr. Jaffre's remarks appeared to be the reason for the communique.
