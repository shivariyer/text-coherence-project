Procter & Gamble Co. is seeking to force Russ Kalvin's Hair Care Co. to stop selling shampoo using P&G's Head & Shoulders and Pert Plus names.
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, P&G said Russ Kalvin's falsely describes "the nature, quality and characteristics of certain shampoos."
P&G in Cincinnati, charged the Saugus, Calif.-based company with "false representations, trademark infringement, false designation of origin, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices."
Russ Kalvin's products were sold under labels such as "Russ Kalvin's Generic Brand Shampoo . . .
Version of Procter & Gamble Head & Shoulders," the suit said.
Russ Kalvin, president and chief executive officer of Russ Kalvin's Inc., said, "My label is very clear that this is not a Procter & Gamble product."
Mr. Kalvin also noted that his company already has stopped selling the products because of poor sales.
