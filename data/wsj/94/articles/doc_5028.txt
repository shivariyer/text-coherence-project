Michael O. Preletz, 55-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, stepped down from those posts because the company's reorganization has been completed.
The president and chief operating officer, Robert C. Genesi, 57, assumes the additional positions of chairman and CEO, succeeding Mr. Preletz.
The company said it is also restructuring its board and elected Charles E. Moran, 52, chief operating officer and chief financial officer of Softdesk Inc., a director.
He succeeds Robert L. Miller, 47, who resigned at the same time Mr. Preletz and Stevan Birnbaum, 56, did.
The company intends to elect a director to succeed Mr. Birnbaum soon.
