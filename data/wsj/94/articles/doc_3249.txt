Sweden's Foersaekrings AB Skandia, the Nordic region's largest insurance group, said it opened an office in Vienna to conduct unit-linked operations in Austria.
The Vienna office is a branch of Skandia Leben AG of Switzerland and will be capitalized with 70 million Austrian schillings ($5.8 million), half of which will be financed through resources from the Swiss subsidiary, Skandia said.
