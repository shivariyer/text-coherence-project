Staples Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire National Office Supply Co., a nationwide contract office supply dealer based in South Hackensack, N.J., in a stock swap.
Staples, a Framingham, Mass., discount office supply company, said the deal was valued at about $100 million, with about $84 million in equity and an assumption of $15 million in debt.
During the past five years, National's internally generated annual revenue growth has been about 20% with revenue in its current fiscal year expected to be $150 million, Staples said.
National's shareholders will receive Staples common stock and the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.
Staples expects the acquisition to be completed by the end of March.
Staples also said it will acquire the 58% of its Canadian joint venture, Business Depot, that it doesn't already own.
The purchase, for about $32 million, will take place as early as mid-1994, Staples said.
