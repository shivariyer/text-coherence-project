CS First Boston is expected to announce as early as today that Charles G. Ward III, co-president of onetime merger powerhouse Wasserstein, Perella & Co. is rejoining First Boston as world-wide head of investment banking.
It's a career U-turn for Mr. Ward, who served as co-head of mergers at First Boston until his highly publicized departure, along with Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, in 1988.
Their rival boutique went on to success with the hostile takeovers that were the trademark of Wall Street in the late 1980s.
First Boston officials could not be reached for comment.
People close to Mr. Ward say he has been told that the position he is taking could lead to higher responsibilities at CS First Boston.
Mr. Ward leaves Wasserstein hard on the heels of Mr. Perella, who joined Morgan Stanley Group Inc. in November as a managing director in investment banking.
This second high-profile exit from Wasserstein comes as the mergers boutique grapples with a strategic shift on Wall Street.
When the firm was founded in 1988, the merger business was sizzling.
In the early 1990s, merger activity cooled, and the firm has tried to branch out, with limited success, into securities underwriting, currency trading, derivatives trading and other areas.
But now the mergers business is heating up again.
CS First Boston, fresh from a corporate reorganization that deemphasized its geographical divisions and sought to integrate the New York brokerage firm more closely with its Swiss parent, CS Holding AG, is apparently attempting to regain its former glory in the mergers field.
