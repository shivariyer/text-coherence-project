Alexander Energy Corp. said merger talks with Nahama & Weagant Energy Co. of Bakersfield, Calif., ended and that no further discussions were anticipated.
The oil and natural gas companies previously announced plans to merge in order to attract more institutional investors and to lower capital costs.
A spokeswoman for Alexander Energy said the companies mutually agreed to terminate discussions after failing to reach a definitive agreement.
