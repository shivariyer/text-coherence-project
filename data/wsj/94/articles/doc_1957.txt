Polaroid Corp. unveiled a computerized security-identification system designed for use with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows personal-computer operating software.
The electronic system lets users customize identification cards and create security databases.
Polaroid already sells film-based security products to hospitals, airports, government agencies, colleges, private companies and the military.
The electronic system captures portraits, signatures and other data for instant retrieval and use, in addition to other features, Polaroid said.
