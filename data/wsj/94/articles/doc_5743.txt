Rogers Communications Inc. appears to be a step closer to launching its proposed bid to acquire Maclean Hunter Ltd., a cable-television, broadcasting and publishing concern based here.
The Ontario Securities Commission issued an order that blocks Maclean Hunter from tendering or voting a block of 36.3 million Maclean shares that are under its control in connection with any bid for Maclean Hunter's stock.
As reported, Rogers, a telecommunications concern, has expressed concern over the possible tax consequences of having to acquire the block, and sought reassurance from regulators before proceeding with its proposed bid for Maclean Hunter.
The ruling from regulators came after Maclean Hunter opted not to challenge an application by Rogers for the order.
Maclean Hunter also agreed not to dispose of the shares without giving Rogers two days' written notice of its intent to do so, provided that Rogers makes its offer by 5 p.m. EST next Friday.
The compromise, worked out by lawyers for the two companies, removes any need for a regulatory hearing and would appear to clear the way for Rogers to make its long-awaited bid.
Graham Savage, chief financial officer of Rogers, declined to comment on when Rogers might make an offer.
"That is a matter for our board to discuss," he said.
Rogers said last week it is interested in acquiring Maclean Hunter for a combination of cash and stock.
At current market values for Maclean Hunter shares, a bid for the company could be worth 2.93 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.18 billion).
That excludes the 36.3 million-share block.
In apparent speculation that a formal offer could come shortly, shares of Maclean Hunter rose in Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday to close at C$17, up 37.5 Canadian cents.
Most analysts have said a first bid by Rogers is likely to be worth at least C$17 a share.
Shares of Rogers fell to C$20, down 62.5 Canadian cents.
