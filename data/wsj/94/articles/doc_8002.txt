Carpenter Technology Corp. said it will redeem $55.3 million of high-coupon debt and take a charge against earnings of $1.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ending March 31 to cover the redemption premium.
In the year-earlier third quarter, the Reading, Pa., maker of specialty steels and steel alloys, had net income of $10.2 million, or $1.22 a share, restated to reflect accounting changes adopted in the fourth quarter.
Sales were $155.4 million.
The redemption will cover the entire outstanding principal amount of the company's 12 7/8% sinking fund debentures due 2014.
The redemption price will be $1,061.62 per $1,000 principal amount.
The redemption date is March 1.
Funding will come from the company's current credit facilities or through issuance of medium-term notes.
Carpenter recently filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $100 million of medium-term notes.
Redemption agent is Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
