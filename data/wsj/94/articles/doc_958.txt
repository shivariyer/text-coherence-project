Novell Inc., which agreed on Monday to purchase WordPerfect Corp., was the winner of a secret bidding war for the company with rival Lotus Development Corp., according to people involved in the negotiations.
Lotus, the world's third-largest supplier of software for personal computers, initially offered to pay as little as $700 million in stock for WordPerfect, the world's largest closely held PC software company.
Learning of the offer, Novell, which unsuccessfully sought to merge with Lotus four years ago, grew interested in WordPerfect and ultimately edged out Lotus with a bid of $1.4 billion in stock, made just hours before the deal was announced, according to the participants.
None of the companies involved will publicly acknowledge the secret bidding war for WordPerfect, but the battle and the resulting price may explain why analysts question the financial value of the deal.
Concerns about the price paid by Novell has sent the company's shares sliding 20% in the last two days in heavy trading.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday Novell shares fell $1, to $19, after plummeting $3.75 on Tuesday.
The steep drop has already lowered the value of the deal for 59 million shares of Novell stock to $1.12 billion.
Some analysts have downgraded their recommendations on the company, with a few even suggesting that investor discontent might scuttle the deal.
"Institutional investors are voting against the deal by swapping money out of Novell and putting money into Lotus and Microsoft Corp.," said David Readerman, a Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst.
The bidding for WordPerfect, which is best known for its word-processing software, began about three to four weeks ago, when Lotus made an offer to buy the company after discussions with its chief executive officer, Adrian Rietveld.
The plan was for Lotus to incorporate WordPerfect's flagship product into a bundle of applications, called a suite, that it sells mainly to corporations.
Microsoft is the overwhelming leader in sales of applications suites, and Lotus felt its suite, which is anchored by its bestselling spreadsheet, could benefit from a top word-processing program.
When Raymond Noorda, Novell's CEO, found out about the negotiations between Lotus and WordPerfect, he quickly decided to bid himself.
Novell, which is based in Provo, Utah, just a few miles south of WordPerfect in Orem, Utah, seemed like a good fit with WordPerfect, because the two companies are near each other and largely run by members of the Mormon church.
After Novell's stock bid reached in excess of $1.3 billion, Lotus's CEO, Jim Manzi, decided to pull out, convinced that the two companies wouldn't necessarily mesh that well and that the deal wasn't worth the price, according to a person close to the deal.
Lotus discussed purchasing WordPerfect "until just before the Novell deal was announced," said Robert Weiler, a Lotus senior vice president.
But, he said, "there was no bidding war, period," because Lotus "never made any formal offer."
Lotus also had doubts about the value of WordPerfect's franchise, a person close to the deal said.
The long-time leader in the PC word-processing market, WordPerfect has seen its position sharply erode in the face of an onslaught by Microsoft.
People familiar with WordPerfect's finances said that last year's record revenue of $700 million is unlikely to be repeated in 1994 because of lower prices on its products and the likelihood of fewer major upgrades to existing products.
WordPerfect's revenue could fall in the range of $550 million to $600 million, they said.
Novell's simultaneous agreement to purchase Borland International Inc.'s Quatro Pro line of spreadsheets is another factor behind the steep decline in Novell's stock.
Here again, analysts fear that in acquiring the third-ranked spreadsheet, a $50 product that accounted for about $75 million in revenue last year, Novell may have overpaid.
While the acquisition of Quattro Pro bolsters a suite of applications offered by WordPerfect, it also helps keep cash-strapped Borland, bloodied from its effort to compete against Microsoft, alive.
In an interview on Monday, Mr. Noorda acknowledged that part of his intention was to help Borland stay competitive in database software, where the company holds a decided edge over Microsoft, a rising second in the market.
Indeed, Mr. Noorda's concern about the fate of Borland may have drawn him into WordPerfect's orbit in the first place.
People familiar with the deal say that WordPerfect turned to Mr. Noorda for help with financing the purchase by WordPerfect of Borland's Quattro Pro.
WordPerfect, which until recently was a sub-Chapter S partnership owned by two executives of the company, either did not have enough cash on hand or could not raise it by other means, according to knowledgeable people.
One reason for the cash shortage: About 15 months ago, Alan Ashton and Bruce Bastian, the owners of WordPerfect, had taken from the company about $180 million in profits owed to them personally.
At the time, Messrs. Ashton and Bastian, among the richest men in America, had expected to replace the cash with proceeds from an initial public offering, but plans for the offering were scrapped last fall as WordPerfect's profitability deteriorated.
As Mr. Noorda studied the possibility of financing a deal for WordPerfect, he learned about negotiations between Lotus and WordPerfect over a sale.
Mr. Noorda decided then to bid for WordPerfect.
At the same time, Larry Sonsini, a prominent Silicon Valley attorney and a member of the boards of both Novell and WordPerfect, resigned from WordPerfect's board to avoid what he described in an interview as a potential "conflict of interest."
Investors also worry about who will lead Novell when Mr. Noorda, approaching 70 years of age, retires as CEO this summer, as expected.
Novell is currently searching for a successor, but no obvious candidates have surfaced.
"There is possibly someone inside Novell that could do the job, but I don't know who it is," says Craig Burton, a former executive with the company and now a consultant in Salt Lake City.
These worries make some analysts pessimistic that Novell's acquisition of WordPerfect can survive a further fall in its share price.
"If the stock falls further, the chances increase that the deal won't go through," said Paul Johnson, an analyst with CS First Boston.
