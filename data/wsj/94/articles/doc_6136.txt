3DO Co., Redwood City, Calif., said its fiscal third-quarter loss widened nearly 78% but a company official expressed optimism that the closely watched Interactive Multiplayer system is on track.
3DO said it had a loss of $7.1 million, or 35 cents a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31.
A year earlier, 3DO had a loss of $4 million, or 26 cents a share.
Revenue for the latest period was $3.5 million.
The loss was in line with analysts' expectations for 3DO, which is backed by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and Time Warner Inc.
In the Nasdaq Stock Market, 3DO closed at $24.25, down 25 cents.
D. Rex Golding, 3DO's chief financial officer, said in a statement that the company had achieved "an important milestone" in shipping its Interactive Multiplayer by the Christmas holiday season.
The multiplayer is a computer with compact-disk drives and high-quality graphics that has been heavily promoted as a controller for home-entertainment centers.
