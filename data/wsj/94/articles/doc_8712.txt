Honeywell Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings topped those of the year-ago period, which was crimped by a big charge.
But sales dropped 5% in the latest quarter, and the building-controls company warned that 1994 would see a decline of about 10% in per-share earnings primarily because of weakness in its space and aviation lines.
Net was $112.6 million, or 85 cents a share, vs. net of $29 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.
The year-ago quarter included $85.1 million in restructuring charges, partially offset by a $7.4 million gain.
Excluding unusual items, operating profit was $204.2 million, off slightly from $208.2 million a year earlier.
Sales in the latest quarter dipped to $1.62 billion from $1.71 billion.
Honeywell said it had achieved its 1993 earnings objective "despite a sluggish U.S. recovery, recessionary conditions in Europe and the continued cyclical downturn in the commercial aviation industry."
Productivity improvements and cost-cutting programs helped firm profit margins, the company said.
Operating profit at the space and aviation control unit declined 39% to $25.9 million, and orders dropped by about 20% in the latest period, the company said.
The company said it expects a solid performance from its home and building-control and industrial businesses in 1994.
But it cautioned that the anticipated improvements at those operations "will not be enough to offset continued weakness" in its space and aviation lines, and the projected adverse effect of foreign-currency fluctuations.
The company also said that it anticipates a strong rebound in per-share earnings beginning in 1995.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Honeywell shares slipped 87.5 cents to $32.75.
For the year, Honeywell reported net of $322.2 million, or 2.40 a share.
In 1992, it had net of $246.8 million, or 1.78 a share, but the results were hurt by charges of $144.5 million for an accounting change and $85.1 million for restructuring.
The charges were partially offset by a $171.4 million gain from litigation settlements.
Sales in 1993 slipped 4.2% to $5.96 billion from $6.22 billion.
