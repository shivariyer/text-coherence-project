British media and banking group Pearson PLC said 1993 pretax profit totaled #208.6 million ($312.6 million), up 38%, with two acquisitions, of Thames Television and Extel, helping the results.
The results are exactly in line with expectations, but the dividend increase to 13 pence (19.5 cents) a share from 12 pence was unexpected.
An unchanged dividend had been forecast.
Pearson Chairman Lord Blakenham said that although the company continues to build on the "written word," its strategy focuses on screen-based businesses, such as Thames Television and financial-information provider Extel.
