In a bid to enter the competitive homeshopping field, Fingerhut Co. will launch "S," the Shopping Network, this fall.
The company said two of the largest cable operators in the U.S. agreed to provide the new home-shopping service to four million subscribers.
The two operators are Continental Cablevision Inc., which serves 2.9 million subscribers, and Time Warner Cable, a unit of Time Warner Inc., which serves 7.2 million subscribers.
Fingerhut, a Minneapolis direct-marketing company, said the merchandising mix will focus on "consumer goods such as housewares, fitness products and electronics."
The new network's programming will also integrate infomercials produced by Fingerhut's USA Direct Inc. subsidiary.
Neither Continental nor Time Warner has yet set a schedule for launching the service, largely because the cable industry is caught in a squeeze for channel space.
Expanded channel capacity will require expensive new digital technology to be deployed in cable systems, a gradual process expected to start in 1995.
