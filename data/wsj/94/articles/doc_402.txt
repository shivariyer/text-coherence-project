J I Case, the farm and construction equipment making unit of Tenneco Inc., announced plans to bring its restructuring program to its European operations.
Under the proposal, which is subject to consultation with Case's European unions, Case plans to cut its agricultural tractor and transmission production and consolidate engineering, manufacturing and product support for construction equipment.
The steps, designed to cut excess capacity, inefficient distribution and too many product lines, are a continuation of Case's $920 million, three-year restructuring program, which began in March 1993.
Case has 7,500 European employees.
-- Close its Vierzon, France, facility, which makes hydraulic excavators, and transfer loader backhoe assembly to its site in Crepy en Valois, France.
-- Create an agricultural transmission production center at its St. Dizier, France plant.
-- Create a single parts depot in France by transferring parts distribution from the Ris Orangis, France, depot to LePlessis (L'Oise), France.
-- Phase out component manufacturing activities at its tractor assembly in Doncaster, Britain; Doncaster will be Case's only such plant following the closing of the Neuss, Germany, plant in 1996.
-- Sell or spin off its St. Dizier and Doncaster foundries.
If Case is unable to do so, it will close the foundries.
Case took several major restructuring steps last year, most of them in the U.S., including closing its Wausau, Wis., plant and its Memphis, Tenn., parts depot.
Last year, it reported operating income of $83 million on sales of $3.7 billion.
