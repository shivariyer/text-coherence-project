Nestle SA, the big Swiss foods concern, denied rumors circulating in Mexico that it plans to pull out of that country.
"Utter baloney," said a spokesman Friday.
"The rumor of a pullback is ridiculous."
The company operates 15 factories in Mexico and had total 1992 sales of the equivalent of 1.7 billion Swiss francs ($1.15 billion) there.
The pullback rumor is related to a strike by 2,000 Nestle workers in Mexico.
The issue centers on "structuring our staff in a more competitive way.
It has nothing to do with major layoffs," the spokesman said.
He added that the situation had to do "partly with changing work rules, more flexible factories, making them more adaptable."
According to the Nestle spokesman, the labor dispute also has nothing to do with salaries or social benefits.
Nestle's employees are the "best paid in the Mexican food industry" and receive pay and benefits that rank them in the top level generally in the country.
"One mustn't forget that in Mexico there is now a certain climate of uncertainty and we don't exclude that this played a role in the decision of unions to go on strike." he added.
The labor dispute began Dec. 7, and Nestle concedes it could create problems if it becomes drawn out.
"If we can't produce, inevitably we will have problems putting stuff on the shelves," the spokesman said.
Nestle said it has asked federal mediators in Mexico to "look at the matter" and the company is "hopeful" a solution can be found.
