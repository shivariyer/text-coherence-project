The dollar eased against the yen in early trading Monday on the heels of the weekend meeting of economic officials from the major industrial nations.
The Group of Seven nations, meeting in Germany, took no action on currency rates.
Moreover, the U.S. and Japan made no progress toward a resolution of their trade dispute.
Trade talks between Washington and Tokyo broke down on Feb. 11, causing the yen to strengthen significantly against the dollar amid a belief in the market that the U.S. favored a strong Japanese currency.
As the yen rises, Japanese exports become more expensive in terms of other currencies, and imports to Japan become less expensive.
Last week, the dollar generally stabilized against the yen.
Now, the G-7 members "are leaving it up to the market to decide what to do with the yen," said Dennis Petitt, foreign-exchange manager at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in New York.
In early Asian-Pacific trading Monday, the dollar was quoted at 104.15 yen, down from 104.85 yen in New York Friday.
The Friday level was itself down from 104.95 yen Thursday.
The dollar also stood at 1.7100 marks on Friday, down from 1.7172 marks on Thursday.
About noon Monday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 104.10 yen and at 1.7085 marks.
"It looks like the Japanese trade-imbalance situation didn't get any better" at the G-7 session, said Michael Faust, vice president and foreign-exchange manager at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a San Francisco investment firm.
But, he said, "given that the market is looking at a broad range of 100 to 110 yen-dollar exchange rate, there should be no immediate sharp selling of the dollar."
He added: "G-7 meetings are historically disappointing as far as the foreign-exchange markets are concerned.
And given the low expectations in the market to begin with, I'll be surprised by a big move off the dollar this week."
