The Big Three U.S. auto makers have been saying that the quality gap between U.S. and Japanese cars has narrowed so much it's hard to spot.
But in the current Consumer Reports, the gap is about as visible as a stalled sedan on an empty highway.
Nissan and Toyota dominate the magazine's annual reliability survey, while such U.S. nameplates as Jeep, Cadillac, and Dodge round out the bottom.
Indeed, an analysis of Consumer Reports surveys over the past four years shows the quality gap between the Big Three and the top Japanese makers hasn't narrowed at all, says George Hoffer, an economics professor at Virginia Commonwealth University.
Mr. Hoffer's analysis showed that over the past four years the Big Three consistently have scored between average and worse than average, while the top-five Japanese auto makers have consistently scored between better than average and much better than average in the magazine's surveys.
That's on a scale that includes five grades: much worse than average; worse than average; average; better than average; and much better than average.
The Big Three point to J.D. Power & Associates surveys to buttress their claims that the gap between domestic and Asian auto makers has narrowed considerably over the past several years.
But the Power survey groups Toyota Motor Co. with such poorly performing brands as the Korean auto maker Hyundai and smaller Japanese makers such as Subaru, lowering what it reports as an average for Asian nameplates.
Robert Knoll, director of automotive testing at Consumer Reports, says the gap is wide and evident in his magazine's surveys of owners of 468,000 vehicles.
Even top-performing U.S. cars, such as the Dodge Intrepid, which Consumer Reports says has about a 20% better than average reliability rating, simply do not stand out as much as such high-quality Japanese cars as the Toyota Tercel, which gets a 70% better-than-average rating, Mr. Knoll said.
