Varian Associates Inc. said because of a chip shortage combined with consumer demand for computers with more powerful memories, its fiscal second-quarter chip orders could top $100 million.
Orders for the fiscal first half, which ends April 1, may top $300 million, the Palo Alto, Calif., company estimated in a statement.
That's more than Varian's chip sales for all of fiscal 1993, which totaled $286 million.
Varian's chip business accounted for about 20% of fiscal 1993 sales of $1.3 billion.
Second-quarter results will be released April 21.
In the year-earlier period, Varian earned $9.3 million, or 51 cents a share, on sales of $325.3 million.
Varian said that during the past few months it has experienced "near-frantic order rates" for memory chips.
The company added that it expects the rate to slow a bit, but predicted that "demand should remain reasonably solid for the forseeable future."
VARIAN ASSOCIATES Inc. supplies equipment used to make semiconductors.
An article Monday incorrectly stated that Varian is a semiconductor maker.
