Your Dec. 9 article "Nissan Recalls -- And Destroys -- Some Minivans," leaves readers with the impression that Nissan's reaction to the serious safety hazard these vans present is an example of corporate goodwill and responsibility.
On the contrary, Nissan van owners and their children were at risk of being caught in a burning van while Nissan fiddled with Band-Aid fixes.
This is not corporate responsibility.
This is customer abuse.
Four failed recalls to "fix" problems that cause engine compartment fires are at least three too many.
After the third failed recall, Nissan fought our petition that sought to force a buyback of all that remains of the 33,000 vans Nissan sold in this country.
Nissan then launched a secret campaign to buy back vans too heat-damaged to fix for as little as $3,000 or as much as $9,000 from those people who raised an enormous fuss.
All the while, Nissan service representatives and "hotline" operators falsely told inquiring owners that the company was not repurchasing any vans.
Nissan's effort to avoid being the first Japanese manufacturer to remove an entire product line from the highway has forced van owners to become "guinea pigs" for Nissan's various experimental fixes subjecting these people to the continued risk of fire.
The vans are so problem-plagued that their resale value is little more than scrap metal, leaving many owners "upside-down" in their car loans, owing much more than their van is worth.
Nissan acknowledges that its fourth recall will probably also fail by installing a complex audible and visual warning system and a governor that limits the speed of an overheated van to 36 miles per hour.
And what will happen then?
Will Nissan slap on another Band-Aid?
