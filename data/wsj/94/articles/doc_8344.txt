In his Dec. 29 letter responding to your Dec. 3 article "Plan to Bar Nonlawyer Advisers in Investor Disputes Debated," Paul N. Young ignores legitimate concerns raised by those who oppose nonlawyer advisers in securities arbitration, and instead frames the debate as a "recent phenomenon" pitting "greedy and self-interested" attorneys and stockbrokers against the public.
This is unfair and a disservice to the individual investor.
The matter is serious, and was explored years ago when I was a member of the NASD's broad-based National Arbitration Committee.
The real issues here are disclosure, accountability and expertise.
Attorneys and stockbrokers are licensed and subject to extensive regulation and high ethical and other standards.
Those who stray from these standards are accountable in many ways, including disciplinary proceedings, litigation and arbitration.
None of these safeguards are available to investors dealing with unregulated arbitration advisers.
Even those advisers with limited investment product or other expertise are not licensed or qualified to practice law, and their proper role is as an expert witness under the guidance of an experienced trial attorney.
I question the disclosures investors receive in light of occasions where some advisers were found to be disbarred attorneys or stockbrokers forced out of the business due to regulatory problems.
As the attorney who successfully argued two of the leading Supreme Court cases in the area of securities arbitration (Shearson v.
McMahon and Rodriguez v.
Shearson), and as one whose practice specializes in this area, I share the concerns of public, regulatory and industry professionals about the use of these advisers in arbitration forums striving to maintain the highest professional standards and preserve public confidence.
