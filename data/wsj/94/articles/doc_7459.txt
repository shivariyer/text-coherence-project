While I enjoyed "Campus Speech Codes . . .," page one, Dec. 22, which reported on the trend away from such codes, I wish to offer two clarifications.
First, the article refers to "a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision that regarded a racially motivated cross-burning as protected speech. . . ."
That decision, R.A.V. v.
St. Paul, did not conclude, as your article suggested, that the First Amendment protects bigots who burn crosses against prosecution in all instances.
Rather, the court concluded that the particular law used to prosecute the cross-burners in St. Paul restricted the content of speech without having a compelling basis for doing so, and was therefore in violation of the First Amendment.
Had the statute been more carefully drafted so that it restricted only the time, place or manner of the speech (the means of expression) rather than the idea expressed by the speech, then it might have been upheld as constitutional.
Second, in discussing the battles raging over campus speech codes, your reporter neglected the important distinction between codes enforced by public as opposed to private universities.
The First Amendment's limitations apply to the government.
A state or city college or university -- created and administered by the government -- may not restrict what students say without satisfying the same stringent test applied by the courts to a legislature's attempt to restrict a person's speech.
Private universities, on the other hand, are not necessarily subject to Constitutional limitations.
It depends upon the degree to which they interact with or are dependent upon the government in their operations.
