U.K. insurer Legal & General Group PLC said a disciplinary committee has found that its Legal & General Assurance Society unit has been guilty on three charges of misconduct and fined #180,000 ($268,200) plus costs of #220,000.
Legal & General admitted three charges of misconduct arising from its investment business between July 1991 and October 1992.
In a statement, the company said it failed to comply with several Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organization rules.
Legal & General said Lautro's disciplinary committee found "the facts disclosed substantial compliance deficiencies amounting to serious breaches of Lautro rules.
Since the problems were identified, we have implemented significant changes to our systems with the intention of achieving best practice standards of compliance."
