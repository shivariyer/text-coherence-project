Sears, Roebuck & Co., which hadn't paid Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Edward A. Brennan a bonus for three years because of poor results, awarded him a $2.1 million bonus in 1993 when the giant retailer and insurer posted record earnings.
Mr. Brennan, whose base salary last year was $1 million, also received 212,897 stock options and restricted stock awards valued at $500,250, according to the company's proxy statement.
Sears said the stock options have a potential value of $6.1 million, assuming a 5% annual stockprice appreciation over the term of the options.
Mr. Brennan also realized a profit of more than $1 million on the exercise of options.
In 1992, he received only $1.4 million in salary and other compensation.
The executive credited by many for reversing Sears's record 1992 loss of $3.93 billion -- Arthur Martinez, chairman and chief executive of Sears Merchandise Group -- also was rewarded last year with a bonus of $1.1 million in addition to his base salary of $900,000.
He also received stock options and other compensation that brought his total compensation to $5.7 million.
