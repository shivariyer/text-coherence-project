Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc. said it received approval from U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore for $125 million in debtor-in-possession financing.
Merry-Go-Round said the revolving line of credit will be financed by CIT Group, New York.
The Joppa, Md., specialty retailer, which filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in early January, said it hopes to file a reorganization plan within the 120-day exclusivity period.
Merry-Go-Round also denied published reports that it would close 100 to 200 stores in the next year.
"No determination has been made by Merry-Go-Round Enterprises to close any stores other than the approximately 80 stores, including approximately 50 Chess King stores, previously announced," the company said.
In addition, the company said it would retreat from the hip-hop urban fashions that failed to garner appeal in the past 12 months, contributing to the company's recent financial problems.
Instead the company plans to stock its stores with more "conservative" styles.
