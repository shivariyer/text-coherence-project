UST Inc. reported an 8.6% increase in fourth-quarter earnings, citing sales gains in its moist smokeless tobacco business.
Net income rose to $86.8 million, or 41 cents a share, from $79.9 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 6% to $286.7 million from $271.1 million.
UST, Greenwich, Conn., said domestic unit volume for the quarter, which included one less shipping day than last year, was down slightly.
Moist tobacco product shipments would have increased 3% on an equivalent shipping day basis for the quarter, the company said.
For the year, volume increased 2.3%, or 3.1% on a shipping equivalent basis.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, UST shares closed at $28.125, down 50 cents.
Earnings were in line with analysts' expectations, but the stock dropped because of a slowdown in unit volume for the year, according to Gary Black, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York.
