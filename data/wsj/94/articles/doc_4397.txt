Bond prices fell amid a weak government auction of two-year notes.
Stocks followed bonds lower, and the dollar rose.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 19.98 points to 3891.68.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.77 to 470.69, and the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 2.04 to 789.11.
Analysts said Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before Congress on Tuesday haunted the two-year note auction.
Though traders were encouraged at first by Mr. Greenspan's remarks, the Fed chief's comments were seen as renewing uncertainty about the timing of another boost in short-term interest rates.
The sale of $17 billion in two-year notes came in at a yield of 4.66%, above the expected 4.64% to 4.65%.
"We had a very sloppy two-year note auction as traders on the short-end are being very cautious and building in the possibility of another tightening," said Donald Maude, chief U.S. fixed income strategist at Scotia McLeod (USA).
"And that spilled over to the long end."
Indeed, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/8-point to yield 6.65%, the highest rate since July.
Mr. Maude said some traders worry that the Fed may know more about the degree of current inflationary pressures than it reveals.
"The reason for the last tightening was the concern about inflation," Mr. Maude said.
"A lot of people are saying that if the Fed tightened what does it see that we don't?"
He believes the sell-off in long-term Treasurys is overdone and that a vigorous rebound is possible.
But he cautions that a catalyst is needed to brighten the outlook of bond investors.
Such a catalyst could be a weak reading today on durable-goods orders for January.
"We've had such strong gains in recent months that if we get a weak number it could alleviate some fears that the economy is growing too fast," he said.
Stocks suffered from the bond market's woes.
Interest-rate sensitive stocks such as utilities fell.
The Dow Jones Utility Average lost 1.18 to 210.59.
The utility average -- often regarded as a harbinger of future stock and bond market activity -- has fallen 9% since Dec. 28.
Economically sensitive stocks, long the market's leaders, also slid.
World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.25 to 115.82.
Stock prices fell.
Volume totaled 309.9 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,165 issues fell and 951 rose.
Bond prices tumbled.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue lost more than half a point, or more than $5 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.64%.
The dollar rose.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.7284 marks and 105.75 yen compared with 1.7235 marks and 105.65 yen Tuesday.
