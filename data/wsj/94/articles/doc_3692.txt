Corning Inc. and its Siecor Corp. joint venture said they completed their previously announced purchase of Northern Telecom Ltd.'s optical-fiber and optical-cable businesses for $130 million.
Corning, based in Corning, N.Y., will pay $108.5 million, with its joint-venture partner Siemens Corp., a unit of communications-equipment concern Siemens AG, paying $21.5 million.
Corning, which also has interests in specialty materials and consumer products, used proceeds from a recent block sale of eight million common shares to Goldman, Sachs & Co. to finance the purchase.
Siecor, 50%-owned by Corning, will continue to operate the optical-cable factory in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
In addition, Siecor and Northern Telecom, a communications-equipment company, have reached a long-term optical-cable supply pact.
