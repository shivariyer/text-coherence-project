Computer Task Group Inc. said it reached an agreement to repurchase 500,000 of its shares held by International Business Machines Corp. for about $3.5 million.
The repurchase will reduce IBM's stake in the information technology services company to 9.1% from 15%.
IBM acquired 1.4 million Series B convertible preferred stock in 1989.
As part of the current transaction, IBM converted its entire stake into Computer Task Group common stock on a 1-for-1 basis.
