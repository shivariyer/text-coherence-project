Coastal Healthcare Group Inc. said it plans to acquire Health Management Associates of America Inc. and Medical Management Associates Inc., two primary-care networks based in Boca Raton, Fla.
Coastal, which provides health-care services to hospitals and other medical providers, said the acquisitions would be made through a stock swap, but didn't disclose the terms.
The two networks own or manage a total of 17 facilities in four Florida counties and had combined 1993 revenue of about $100 million.
