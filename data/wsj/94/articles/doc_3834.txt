Following up on the 1990 clean air law, the Environmental Protection Agency is ordering chemical companies to install new equipment to capture millions of pounds of toxic pollution.
The final requirements are scheduled to be announced by EPA Administrator Carol Browner today to meet a court-imposed deadline.
The requirements are aimed at cutting toxic releases into the air at more than 350 chemical plants, many of them in Texas, Louisiana and New Jersey.
The EPA is estimating that as much as one billion pounds of toxic releases might be captured, although environmentalists said that figure might be high.
Chemical companies have anticipated the requirements and many of them already have installed some of the equipment to meet the new rules, according to industry officials.
Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, the new regulations were to have been in place by November 1992.
When the Bush administration showed no sign of meeting the deadline, two environmental groups sued and won a court order setting a new timetable for issuing the requirements.
The EPA's latest action is to comply with the court order.
