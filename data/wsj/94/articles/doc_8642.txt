McDonnell Douglas Corp. reported a fourth-quarter net loss after a $450 million pretax charge relating to its C-17 military-transport jet, but the company said operating results improved.
The loss, reflecting a charge that had been expected under terms of a recent Pentagon settlement allowing production of the plane to proceed, amounted to $132 million, or $3.66 a share.
A year earlier, profit totaled $762 million, or $19.46 a share, after a retiree health-care-related gain.
Excluding the C-17 charge and the year-earlier gain, once-troubled McDonnell Douglas's fourth-quarter earnings would have totaled $143 million, or $3.63 a share, compared with $86 million, or $2.20 per share, a year earlier.
However, the St. Louis company's commercial-airplane business is still mired in the industry's current downturn.
Revenue in the quarter plunged 21% to $3.63 billion from $4.62 billion.
For all of 1993, McDonnell Douglas had net income of $396 million, or $10.10 a share, vs. a year-earlier loss of $781 million, or $20.10 a share.
Annual revenue fell 17% to $14.49 billion from $17.37 billion.
The company's stock fell $1.125, or 1%, to close at $112.375 in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Herbert Lanese, the company's chief financial officer, told reporters after the results were announced that accomplishments of the last year "re-established ourselves and give us time to grow."
With the company stabilized, Mr. Lanese said, directors will contemplate raising the 35-cent quarterly dividend at a meeting later this month.
He also said the company will look seriously at a stock buyback, although it may prove more worthwhile to shareholders for the company to reinvest in businesses that offer strong prospects for trade, such as fighter jets and the C-17 military transport.
McDonnell Douglas had said in late October that it might incur the C-17 charge, which in after-tax terms was $275 million, or $6.99 a share.
The charge resulted from a settlement with the government that allowed 40 C-17s to continue to be built.
As a result, McDonnell dropped more than $1.6 billion in claims for costs related to the program, some of which it had counted on recovering from the government.
In large part, the charge covers new investment that McDonnell has agreed to make in the C-17 program.
For example, the company has agreed to pay for its share of a flight-test extension, new design systems, cost-monitoring programs and a cost-reduction program.
Mr. Lanese said the charge was partially offset by gains in 1993 of $220 million, or $5.61 a share, from the sale of an information-systems unit, resolution of a tax matter, and reversal of part of a one-time charge taken in 1992 to meet new health-care accounting standards.
A year ago, after several years of disappointing financial performance by the company, Mr. Lanese vowed to meet a series of aggressive financial targets for improving profits and cash flow, cutting debt, and resurrecting McDonnell Douglas's lowered credit ratings.
Among the gains in the past year has been a reduction of corporate aerospacerelated debt to $1.63 billion at year end from $2.77 billion at the end of 1992.
Strengthened operations include those making F/A-18 and F-15 fighter aircraft.
The company hopes to win a competition within the next month, in which it is trying to get a $2 billion order for F-15s from Israel.
For now, the outlook is bleak for the company's Douglas Aircraft Co. commercial-airplane business in Long Beach, Calif.
While the unit has been slightly profitable, Mr. Lanese said it is likely to deliver only three or four jetliners in the first quarter.
The rest of 1994 will show improvement, he said, but 1995 and 1996 could prove very difficult years for the operation if orders don't improve.
One bright prospect for the commercial-airplane unit comes from widespread reports that it is favored to win orders for more than 20 smaller MD-90 models when the Saudi Arabian state-run carrier Saudia places a large order for many sizes of jetliners.
