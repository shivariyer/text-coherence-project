First Chicago Corp.
Chairman Richard Thomas took home about $2.2 million in salary and bonus last year, nearly double the $1.16 million in 1992, according to the banking concern's 1993 proxy statement.
In addition, Mr. Thomas received 60,000 restricted stock options with a present value of around $700,000, compared to 1992's grant of 80,000 options that had a value of $740,000 when granted.
"The 1993 award was in recognition of the corporation's record earnings" that exceeded the company's projections, the proxy said.
Last year, First Chicago earned $804.5 million, or $8.78 a share, up nearly tenfold from the previous year, driven by big profits in consumer banking and a turnaround in the cost of bad debts.
First Chicago was the first big bank to write down in bulk the value of its problem real estate holdings, and has since shed nearly $1 billion of bad real estate.
"First Chicago had a particularly great year last year, " a spokeswoman said.
