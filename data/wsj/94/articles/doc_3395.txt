House Appropriations Committee Chairman William Natcher, too weak to come to the floor of the House, ended his record voting streak after making 18,401 consecutive roll calls in his more than 40 years in Congress.
The 84-year-old Kentucky Democrat's declining health has already set off a scramble to find a new chairman, and Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin is favored to take over the committee, which has immense power over government spending and President Clinton's investment initiatives.
Mr. Obey, 55 years old, would bring strong ties to the leadership and labor and can be expected to try to break down some of the insular character of the appropriations panel and bring it more in line with the sentiments of the Democratic caucus.
To win, the Wisconsin liberal must jump over older members, including his chief opponent Rep. Neal Smith of Iowa, but his campaign has benefited from the wholesale changes in the House in recent years and appetite for a younger leadership.
