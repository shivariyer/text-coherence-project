But I don't think the end of the bull market is here.
This is the first real correction we've had since 1990, and it feels a little strange."
She added that small-cap stocks not only have "better productivity than the Fortune 500 companies, but they provide productivity to the Fortune 500.
Smaller stocks are well-positioned because they're mean and lean, not fat and lazy."
