Finmeccanica SpA, the Italian state engineering group, confirmed it is negotiating for a stake in the commercial-airplane unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
Finmeccanica is the parent company of Alenia, a major supplier to McDonnell Douglas's Douglas Aircraft Co., in Long Beach, Calif.
McDonnell Douglas is based in St. Louis.
People familiar with the U.S. company's actions have reported that McDonnell Douglas has approached Alenia and suppliers in Asia and elsewhere about buying shares in its Douglas Aircraft operation.
A spokesman for Finmeccanica's holding company, state conglomerate Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale SpA, said that Finmeccanica was in talks with the U.S. group, but declined to elaborate on Italian press reports that the company could buy 10% to 20% of Douglas Aircraft Co.
The IRI spokesman said that the price and size of the stake to be purchased were under discussion.
