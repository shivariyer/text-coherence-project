New Valley Corp. said it filed an amended reorganization plan that calls for it to make a one-time payment of $198 million to "fully fund" its underfunded pension plan's existing obligations.
New Valley, of Paramus, N.J., the parent of Western Union Financial Service Inc., said the amended plan proposes to fund the pension and creditor payments through cash on hand, escrow funds, proceeds from the sale of as much as $500 million of debt and an equity investment by Electronic Data Systems Corp., a unit of General Motors Corp., of $23 million, in exchange for 8.6% of the company.
The company's original plan, filed in November, proposed for the pension liability to be paid over time from future operating cash flow.
A hearing to consider the amended plan is set for March 18.
Three competing plans have been filed.
