Comsat Corp. said it will buy telecommunications-equipment maker Radiation Systems Inc. of Sterling, Va., for $18.25 a share in stock, or about $150 million.
Radiation Systems stock soared 31% to $17.625, up $4.125 in heavy trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Comsat closed at $27.125, up 25 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
Comsat, which provides satellite networks and other communications gear, said Radiation Systems and a Comsat division would join forces to serve the market for wireless communications.
Comsat, which already owns 4.9% of Radiation System's stock, said it would exchange each share of Radiation Systems for $18.25 in Comsat stock.
Radiation Systems granted Comsat an irrevocable option to purchase up to an additional 15% of Radiation Systems' common stock outstanding, at an exercise price of $18.25 a share.
Comsat said it doesn't expect the purchase to materially dilute its 1994 earnings.
Regulators and Radiation Systems shareholders must approve the purchase.
Following the announcement, Standard & Poor's Corp. affirmed its single-A rating of Comsat's senior unsecured debt.
Total debt is about $525 million, S&P said.
Separately, Radiation Systems reported fiscal second-quarter net income of $1.3 million, or 16 cents a share, down 42% from $2.3 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $27.1 million compared with $29.3 million a year earlier.
The company said the decline was largely due to the delay in settling a business interruption insurance claim.
