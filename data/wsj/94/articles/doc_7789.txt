Cray Research Inc., reversing a year-ago loss, reported earnings of $24.3 million, or 93 cents a share, on revenue of $302.6 million for the fourth quarter.
In the year-ago quarter, the Eagan, Minn., supercomputer company had a loss of $26.5 million, or $1 a share, on revenue of $227.3 million.
Results for the 1992 fourth quarter included a one-time restructuring charge of $42.8 million.
Buoyed by the results, the company announced that about 4,500 eligible employees will receive an extra week's pay as a bonus, costing Cray Research about $4 million.
The company attributed its improved performance to a combination of increased revenue, higher gross margins on its top-of-the-line C916 supercomputers and lower operating expenses.
The company is projecting a 1994 revenue increase of 10% from 1993, with continued improvement in earnings.
Cray Research shares closed unchanged at $26.25 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
