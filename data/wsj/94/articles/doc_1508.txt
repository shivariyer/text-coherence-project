Philadelphia Suburban Corp.'s chairman thinks there is some prospect for moderate earnings growth for the year at the Bryn Mawr, Pa., water-utility holding company.
In an interview, Nicholas DeBenedictis, who is also president and chief executive, said analysts' consensus estimate for 1994 earnings of $1.30 a share is achievable, assuming a normal summer and approval of a reasonable rate increase.
The company has requested a rate rise of 14%, or $14 million, and expects a decision by the end of the summer.
About half of the rate-increase request is for reimbursement of federal taxes and costs related to accounting changes.
The consensus estimate would give the company net income of about $15 million.
In 1993, Philadelphia Suburban had net of $13.8 million, or $1.27 a share, on about 5% fewer shares.
Revenue this year is expected to exceed last year's $101.2 million because of the addition of some fast-growing systems.
