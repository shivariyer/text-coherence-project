South Korea's Daewoo conglomerate said the combined net income of its 20 subsidiaries surged 56% to 464.8 billion won ($575.4 million) last year, thanks to active exports and local sales of automobiles and other heavy-industry products.
According to a Daewoo report, combined sales also posted hefty growth in 1993, gaining 35% to 27.3 trillion won.
The company's debt-to-asset ratio, meanwhile, dropped to 261% last year from 329% a year earlier, thanks to improved earnings, the report said.
"The overall improved business circumstances were attributable to the hefty growth in both exports and local sales of automobiles, electronics goods, ships and machinery," said a Daewoo spokesman.
"Daewoo's active market expansion into the Commonwealth of Independent States, China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East also contributed."
Net income of Daewoo Corp., the group's trading arm, rose 21% to 48.6 billion won in 1993 from 40.3 billion won the year earlier.
Sales of the trading unit jumped 16% to 9.5 trillion won from 8.2 trillion won.
Earnings of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Heavy Machinery Ltd. fell 5% to 200.6 billion won last year from 211.2 billion won in 1992.
Sales of the shipbuilder, however, posted a slight rise of 0.2% to 1.6 trillion won.
The report said net income of Daewoo Electronics Co. rose 15% last year to 19 billion won as sales climbed 16% to 2 trillion won.
Daewoo Motor Co., which has suffered from declining profits for the past three years, failed to pull out of negative territory.
It reported an estimated loss of 60 billion won last year, narrowing from a loss of 95.6 billion won in 1992.
