Calvin Klein Inc. signed a letter of intent to sell its jeans business to Rio Sportswear Inc. in a transaction valued at more than $35 million.
The move comes just weeks after Calvin Klein struck a similar agreement to sell its underwear business to Warnaco Group Inc. for $64 million.
Under the agreement, Rio, a New York maker of jeans and other apparel, will purchase Calvin Klein's mens and womens jeans divisions and the company's domestic plants.
Rio, a unit of Oshkosh B'Gosh Inc. in Oshkosh, Wis., will have a license to make the jeans and pay ongoing royalties to Calvin Klein, which will continue to control advertising and designs of the jeans.
The companies have also agreed to jointly develop and launch a children's jeans business.
Calvin Klein purchased its jeans business in 1983 from Puritan Fashions Inc. for $65.8 million.
The jeans became Mr. Klein's signature, catapulting the designer into the forefront of American fashion.
But the Puritan purchase also burdened the company with junk bond debt for several years.
With the sale of its jeans business, Calvin Klein is left manufacturing primarily a women's couture collection and CK secondary women's and men's collections.
Fragrance, leather goods and other products are already sold under license.
Calvin Klein officials couldn't be reached to comment on the announcement, which was made by Rio.
Mr. Klein "has become a six percenter," said Alan Millstein, a New York fashion industry consultant, referring to the typical percentage of sales that companies receive when they license products.
"By selling the jeans business, he buys peace of mind; and he can concentrate on what he does best, advertising and self-promotion."
