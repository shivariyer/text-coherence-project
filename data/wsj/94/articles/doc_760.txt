The U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve yesterday announced they had jointly established a $6 billion swap facility with the Mexican government, giving Mexico the wherewithal to support the peso when its currency markets reopen today .
Mexican financial institutions were closed for a day following the Wednesday night assassination of the country's leading presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio.
"This agreement demonstrates continued strong support for Mexico's economic policies," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in a joint statement.
Mexico's currency hardly moved at all yesterday, because banks in Mexico were closed and because the peso isn't widely traded internationally.
Currency experts said they weren't worried about a run on the peso.
Unlike the currencies of many industrialized nations, it's difficult to short the peso -- or bet it will drop, as hedge funds did with European currencies last year, because many of instruments used for such an operation don't exist in Mexico.
One way a run could start is if many holders of Mexican treasury bills decided to sell at once.
The assassination of Mr. Colosio, while traumatic, isn't enough to convince these investors that Mexico's economic reforms will be thrown off track, according to one currency expert.
Though optimistic about Mexico's economic future, fund managers would have to sell assets if there were a rush of redemption orders from investors spooked by the assassination.
According to another currency expert, if there is a rush of redemption orders, developing-nation fund managers would move to sell the most liquid assets they hold and Mexican treasury bills would top the list.
