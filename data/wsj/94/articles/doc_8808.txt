Brunswick Corp. said it will pay the Internal Revenue Service about $55 million to settle a dispute over the deductibility of about $500 million of intangible assets.
The Lake Forest, Ill., maker of boats and recreational products said it had more than adequately reserved for the tax payment, which represents taxes and net interest for 1986 through last year.
Brunswick said the pact with the IRS won't have any impact on its net income.
The dispute arose when an IRS agent proposed substantially increasing the company's taxable income by not permitting the deduction of virtually all of the intangible assets picked up by Brunswick when it acquired its Bayliner and Sea Ray operations in 1986.
The IRS agreed to allow deductions for the acquired amortizable intangibles, and Brunswick agreed to increase the amortizable lives of most of the assets.
