CompuServe Information Services said it added a record 80,000 new members to its computer on-line service in February.
The Columbus, Ohio, company, a unit of H&R Block Co., said the number of new subscribers is the largest monthly addition in its 15-year history.
Increased awareness of on-line services, advertising, and the declining cost of computers have attributed to the growth, a spokeswoman said.
CompuServe currently serves nearly 1.8 million subscribers.
Rival Prodigy Services Co., a unit of International Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck & Co., is in 1.1 million households, while America Online Inc. has tripled its subscriber base in the last year to 700,000.
