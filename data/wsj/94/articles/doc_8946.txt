Immunomedics Inc. said David W. Ortlieb, president and chief executive officer since July 1992, is resigning effective Feb. 1.
Mr. Ortlieb, 63 years old, was not available for comment yesterday.
A spokeswoman said he is leaving the company for "personal reasons."
David M. Goldenberg, 55, chairman of the board and founder of the biopharmaceutical company, will become chief executive, a position he has held for most of the company's 11-year existence.
The position of president will not be filled, the company said.
In addition, Amy Factor, 36, vice president of finance and administration, treasurer and secretary, will become executive vice president, a new position.
Ms. Factor will take on some of Mr. Ortlieb's tasks in addition to her current responsibilities, the spokeswoman said.
Mr. Ortlieb had been a director of the company since November 1991 and stepped in to help Immunomedics establish its manufacturing facility and launch the company's first imaging agent, Dr. Goldenberg said.
Although he had signed a three-year contract, "it was understood that he could leave earlier once he completed the task," Dr. Goldenberg added.
"He came in to help us as a temporary measure, and finished the task in a year and a half."
