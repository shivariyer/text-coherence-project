Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. plans to launch its cholesterol-reducing drug at roughly half the price of competing products made by Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
By pricing its drug at near-generic-drug levels, the U.S. unit of Swiss pharmaceutical maker Sandoz AG is taking aim at an estimated huge, multibillion-dollar market dominated by Merck's Mevacor and Zocor.
A few years ago, Bristol-Myers introduced its drug, Pravachol, priced somewhat below Merck's drugs.
By sharply underpricing the market leaders, Sandoz is capitalizing on the growing cost consciousness of the market, particularly in managed-care customers.
A less costly alternative to the current market leaders would offer managed-care customers a way to quickly cut one of their biggest prescription-drug costs.
And it might appeal to individual patients who pay for drugs out of pocket.
The Sandoz drug would present a test for Merck's recently acquired Medco Containment Services Corp., which manages drug costs for health plans.
Medco customers and competitors will undoubtedly be watching to see whether Medco offers the lower-priced Sandoz product, or whether Merck matches the Sandoz price.
A spokesman for Merck said the company hadn't decided on a strategy to combat the Sandoz pricing.
"The market is expanding," he said.
"There are many millions of people who have high cholesterol who need to be treated and haven't been treated.
We believe that Mevacor and Zocor will continue to grow."
The Sandoz drug would have to undergo a review by Medco's pharmacy and therapeutics committee, a spokesman said.
"The commitment from Merck-Medco is to offer the best medicine for the best patient health."
