Harken Energy Corp. said it will take a noncash fourth-quarter charge of $3.1 million to write down certain assets it plans to sell.
The Dallas energy concern said it will liquidate some idle drilling rigs and related equipment and use the proceeds in its international operations in Bahrain and Colombia.
The planned sales don't involve Harken's Supreme Well Service operations in Texas, Harken said.
For the 1992 fourth quarter, Harken reported net income of $806,000, or one cent a share, including a tax benefit of $172,000.
Revenue for that quarter was $2.5 million.
