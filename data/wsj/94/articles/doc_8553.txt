QVC Network Inc. extended its $10.1 billion takeover offer for Paramount Communications Inc. for 10 days until Jan. 31, matching the expiration of the latest offer by Viacom Inc.
QVC abided by the bidding rules set by New York-based Paramount in extending the offer, even though people close to QVC had threatened that the home-shopping company might contest the bidding procedures.
QVC has objected to extending its offer because Viacom, with its latest offer, hasn't topped the value of QVC's bid.
Although Viacom's offer, valued at about $9.8 billion, is less than QVC's bid on a market-value basis, most traders said they prefer the Viacom bid because it provides protection against a downturn in Viacom's stock price.
Viacom is based in Dedham, Mass.
Paramount's board is set to meet tomorrow afternoon to review the latest Viacom bid and decide whether to continue endorsing QVC's offer.
QVC said holders of 18.7 million, or 16%, of Paramount's shares outstanding, have tendered their shares to QVC.
