Crompton & Knowles Corp. said fourth-quarter net income rose 68%, boosted, in part, by strength in its specialty process-equipment and controls business and a charge in the year-earlier period.
The Stamford, Conn., maker and marketer of specialty chemicals and equipment said fourth-quarter profit was $12.5 million, or 24 cents a share, up from $7.4 million, or 15 cents a share in the year-earlier period.
Last year's quarter included a charge of $3 million, or six cents a share, for the early retirement of debt.
Sales rose about 4% to $142.9 million from $137.6 million.
For the year, Crompton & Knowles said net rose 51% to $51.7 million, or $1 a share, from $34.5 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. 1992 results included charges totaling $8.8 million, or 18 cents a share, for debt retirement and accounting changes.
Sales for the year rose nearly 8% to $558.3 million.
