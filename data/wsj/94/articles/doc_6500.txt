Storage Technology Corp. is expected to show its long-delayed Iceberg data-storage line at a meeting with securities analysts on Thursday.
Common shares of the Louisville, Colo., maker of tape and disk storage systems gained last week, rising $1.875 to close at $36.25, in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.
A spokesman said 15 Iceberg units have been sent to customers, including both test and production units.
He wouldn't predict when volume shipments of Iceberg units would begin, but said the company plans to bring out four new disk-storage products for mainframe computers this year.
He also said Storage Technology would increase its work force by about 1,000 people, or 10%, to support the effort.
Iceberg is designed to be fault-tolerant -- to continue working even if a part fails -- and uses a design approach in which many smaller disks work together as a single system.
It was announced two years ago but has been delayed repeatedly by software-related problems.
