Health Systems International Inc. expects to report a fourth-quarter loss of about $18.4 million, or 37 cents a share, after $29.7 million of merger expenses, Roger F. Greaves, co-chairman and co-chief executive officer, said.
These will be the first consolidated results reported by Health Systems.
The managed-care company was formed by the merger of QualMed Inc., Pueblo, Colo., and closely held HN Management Holdings Inc., the parent of Health Net, based in Woodland Hills, Calif.
Mr. Greaves said comparable results for the 1992 quarter weren't available.
The merger expenses included payments to investment bankers and attorneys.
Results were further depressed by a decision "to clean up the balance sheet," Mr. Greaves said in an interview.
For the full year, Health Systems expects to report net income of about $23.9 million, or 48 cents a share, Mr. Greaves said.
Before the merger expenses and unusual litigation expenses, earnings per share were $1.03, he said.
