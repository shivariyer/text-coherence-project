Hyundai Motor Corp. said it has decided not to reopen its plant in Bromont, Quebec, to build the redesigned Elantra model as planned.
Instead, the auto maker will build the car in South Korea, where the company is based.
Hyundai last year announced plans to build the next generation Elantra model at its assembly plant in Canada starting in July 1995.
But the auto maker said "currency exchange rates and changes in trade environment, combined with a weak global economy and sluggish automotive market make it difficult for the company to go forward with the plan as originally conceived."
Hyundai said it will conduct a one-year feasibility study on how to best use its Canadian assembly plant.
The plant, which opened in 1989, has been closed since September 1993.
If Hyundai fails to reopen the plant, it will be forced to pay back $46 million in subsidies provided by the Canadian government.
