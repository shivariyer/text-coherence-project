Virginia Electric & Power Co. said it asked state regulators to block a proposed partnership between DuPont Co. and an LG&E Energy Corp. unit that would own and operate electric plants at two DuPont fiber plants in Virginia Power's service territory as well as seven in other midAtlantic and southeastern regions.
Virginia Power, a unit of Dominion Resources Inc., Richmond, Va., said the proposed arrangement would violate state law that gives Virginia Power the exclusive right to furnish electricity to retail customers in its service area in Virginia.
A spokesman for DuPont said, "We will take the necessary steps to be sure the State Corporation Commission knows what we're planning and that the partnership wouldn't be a regulated utility nor would it violate any state law."
An LG&E spokesman said, "This isn't really a retail issue" because the partnership will operate cogeneration units that are already there.
"We're not creating a new sale."
