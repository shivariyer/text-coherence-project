New York state insurance officials are investigating whether Prudential Insurance Co. of America violated state rules governing the sale of group pension plans.
The state says Prudential, the nation's largest insurer, sold certain group pension products before receiving state approval.
In other cases, the state says, Prudential sold products after the state rejected them.
Kevin Foley of the New York Insurance Department said that "thousands" of individuals were covered by the pension plans under investigation but that none are at risk of losing their money.
Prudential said in a statement that "fewer than 100" people were affected.
The Newark, N.J., company discovered the situation itself and took its findings to the state in September.
The executives responsible for the problem have been disciplined, Prudential said.
People familiar with the matter said the officials are no longer with the company.
"Any time you find a company needed prior approval and then flouted it, it becomes a serious matter," Mr. Foley said, calling the violations "technical."
The pension products involved are so-called defined-contribution plans, including 401 (k) s, 403 (b) s and individual retirement accounts, bought by corporations on behalf of their employees.
They were sold by Prudential Asset Management Co.
Pension products are one of Prudential's biggest lines of business.
Prudential is working with the department on a settlement, but no settlement will be made until the state concludes its investigation.
In addition to forcing the company to reverse some of the sales, New York could fine Prudential.
Insurance Department fines for violations of this type are generally small.
