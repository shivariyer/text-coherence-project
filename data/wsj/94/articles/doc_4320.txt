Aileen Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month, said it received final court approval of its $5 million revolving credit line.
The maker of women's sportswear, which operates retail outlet stores in 40 states, said the lender is Sterling National Bank & Trust Co. of New York.
Separately, Aileen said net retail sales for the five weeks ended Jan. 29 fell to $3.2 million from a year-earlier $4.8 million.
Sales at stores open at least a year fell 40%.
The company blamed bad weather for the decline.
