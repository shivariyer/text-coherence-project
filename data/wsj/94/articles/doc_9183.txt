The European Union's top trade official is calling for a shift in EU aid for Eastern Europe toward more projects that would meet the real needs of average citizens.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EU commissioner for external economic relations, plans to push in a speech in Scotland today the need to broaden the EU's aid efforts beyond the largely technical assistance it has provided since communism's collapse, sources said.
The new initiative has been under development for some time, but its unveiling is timed to coincide with President Clinton's trip to Europe.
Sir Leon plans to highlight the EU's leading role in providing aid for the former East Bloc, but to advocate new directions in a program often criticized for a bloated bureaucracy and for providing few tangible benefits for the region's citizens.
"It's important that people in Russia and the other countries of Eastern Europe see the actual benefits of our aid programs," one Brittan aide said.
Sir Leon plans to highlight the need for EU aid programs to provide some of the social services that formerly flowed from state-owned industries, people familiar with the speech said.
