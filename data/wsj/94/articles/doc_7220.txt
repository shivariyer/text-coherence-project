Armco Inc. said it plans to sell its operating insurance businesses to closely held Vik Brothers Insurance Inc. for about $85 million, and will take a charge to reflect the sale.
Armco, a domestic producer of stainless and electrical steel, said it would take a charge against fourth-quarter earnings of $45 million in connection with the proposed sale.
The Pittsburgh company posted a loss of $376.7 million, or $3.68 a share, in the 1992 fourth quarter.
Vik, based in Raleigh, N.C., is a property and casualty insurance holding company.
