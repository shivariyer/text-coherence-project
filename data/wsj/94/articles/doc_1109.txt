GTE Corp.'s GTE Spacenet Corp. introduced an on-line network to deliver images and multimedia applications for business-to-business users.
The company said the new service, called Luminary, will transmit high-resolution images and documents to a business user's computer in seconds.
GTE hopes to sell the service to businesses such as law offices, engineering firms and publishers, which typically store data on CD-ROMs.
Using computer, satellite and fiberoptic technologies, Luminary can deliver a 20-page document within six seconds, as opposed to the fourteen minutes it would take by a 9600-baud service, GTE said.
