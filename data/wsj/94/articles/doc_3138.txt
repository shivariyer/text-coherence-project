Susan Lee's Feb. 25 review (Leisure & Arts) of "John Maynard Keynes: The Economist as Savior" by Robert Skidelsky, says Keynes was anti-Semitic.
There are only two rather small sections of the book that discuss Jews.
If I were reviewing the book and chose to note the possibility of Keynes being anti-Semitic, I would at least try to keep some balance and excerpt from the other section as well.
That second section describes how, in 1933, Keynes vigorously defended his description of German policy toward Jews as "barbarism."
Perhaps the question well-known to students of economic thought of "Which Keynes?" could also be asked of his attitude toward Jews.
Mr. Skidelsky suggests stereotypes should be viewed within the context of the times in which they are made.
To me the book is well worth its price.
And it should be to anyone who derives value from exploring the musings and intellectual quirks of a great mind.
