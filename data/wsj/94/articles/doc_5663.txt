Royal Appliance Manufacturing Co. said shareholder suits filed against the company and its officers relating to public earnings estimates made by Royal were dismissed by a federal court.
According to Royal, maker of the Dirt Devil line of vacuum cleaners, the lawsuits alleged that the company had made misleading public comments about earnings projections for 1992.
The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio dismissed the case, saying that Royal's statements "read in context" wouldn't have misled investors because the company made investors aware of the risks, Royal said.
