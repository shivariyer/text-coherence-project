Southwestern Property Trust, a real-estate investment trust based in Dallas that invests in apartment properties, said it is broadening its geographical focus and changing its name to South West Property Trust.
The company said it opened regional offices in Charlotte, N.C., and Little Rock, Ark., in a move to expand into the Southeast.
"The company is diversifying its operations into the Southeast because that area continues to benefit from above-average job growth in a similar manner to the Southwest," John Schneider, chief executive officer, said.
The company expects to complete its first two acquisitions in Arkansas next month.
They are apartment properties in Little Rock with a total of 512 units.
