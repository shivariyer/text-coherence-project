The corporate empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family was hit by more big write-downs totaling 433.5 million Canadian dollars (US$330.9 million), reflecting efforts by the group to finally put behind it the problems of recent years in its real-estate holdings.
The bulk of the write-downs, or C$340.9 million, relates to Trizec Corp., a Calgary, Alberta, developer that is currently negotiating with its creditors to restructure some C$1.9 billion of debt.
Other write-downs in the group reflect declining values of properties, mainly in California, that are held by other companies in the group.
After two consecutive years of big write-downs on its property assets, the Bronfman group is signaling that it believes the bleeding is stanched.
"We've hit a lot of these investments very hard with write-downs, both last year and this year.
I'm very hopeful we've seen the end of it.
There are some signs the industry is beginning to emerge" from a four-year property slump, said Gordon Arnell, president and chief executive officer of Carena Developments Ltd., the key holding company in the Bronfmans' real-estate interests.
Toronto financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman also have interests in financial services and natural resources.
The brothers are cousins of Montreal's Bronfman family, which controls the Seagram Co. distilling dynasty, but the two families have no business operations in common.
The write-downs didn't come as a surprise.
Trizec, which has been in default on some of its debt since the fall, had said it would revalue the assets on its balance sheet in anticipation of reaching a restructuring pact with its creditors.
