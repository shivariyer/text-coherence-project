Turner Corp. reported a $9 million loss for the fourth quarter as a result of restructuring charges and an increase in reserves related to its real estate properties.
The construction company said in New York that the fourth-quarter loss equaled $1.83 a share compared with a profit of $1.1 million, or 11 cents a share, a year ago.
The 1993 quarter included an $8.5 million pretax restructuring charge and a $3.8 million increase in its reserves for disposal of real estate properties.
Revenue fell to $11.7 million from $17.7 million.
Turner didn't release details of the restructuring plans.
It has reduced its work force by 24% since 1989 to 2,500 by the end of 1993.
Turner said it expects the construction market to rise only slightly this year.
