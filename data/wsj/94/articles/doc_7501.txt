Sales at Japan's major department stores and supermarkets in December were 2.645 trillion yen ($24.06 billion), down 4.5% from the year-earlier month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
December's decline extended the streak of year-on-year drops to 19 months and follows declines of 6.9% in November, 3.5% in October and 3.7% in September.
But the pace of the decline was slower than the 7.5% fall in March -- the sharpest slide since the ministry adopted the current statistical method in January 1988.
