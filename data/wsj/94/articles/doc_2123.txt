Chemical Banking Corp. gave additional corporate responsibilities to James B. Lee Jr., head of its loan-syndications group, as part of a reorganization of its global bank.
Mr. Lee, 41, had reported to Mark Solow, senior executive vice president and member of the bank's management committee.
He now will be in charge of corporate finance products, reporting to Vice Chairman William Harrison, and will join the bank's 16-person management committee.
Under Mr. Lee's leadership, the group has become the No. 1 syndicator of U.S. bank financing.
Mr. Solow, 45, will take over the banking concern's client relationships for North America, Western Europe and Asia.
Previously, Mr. Solow had client responsibilities for U.S. and Canadian companies, a spokesman said.
"These changes reflect a shift toward a functional structure in order to serve our global clients more effectively and expand and build upon our leadership positions in important product areas," Mr. Harrison said.
