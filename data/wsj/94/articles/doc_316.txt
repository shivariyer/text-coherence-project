Saks Fifth Avenue said it plans to close two underperforming stores in the San Diego area.
Philip B. Miller, chairman and chief executive of Saks, said the decision to close its stores in Mission Valley and La Jolla, Calif., follows the retailer's plan to "concentrate its resources on those stores and markets where the corporation gets a higher return on invested capital."
The company said it would consider re-entering the market "if the right opportunity presents itself."
Saks, with 59 stores in 22 states, is owned by Investcorp, a Bahrain-based investor group.
