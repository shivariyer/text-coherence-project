Northrop Corp. expressed interest in merging with Grumman Corp. for much of the last year but failed to head off this week's $1.94 billion purchase of Grumman by Martin Marietta Corp., according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Grumman, based in Bethpage, N.Y., approached Martin Marietta in early February and secured the winning offer of $55 a share by Feb. 21 after agreeing to exclusive negotiations, the filings by Grumman and Martin Marietta said.
On Feb. 25, the filings said, Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa sent a letter to Grumman expressing "considerable disappointment" that the seller wanted to end their talks, and offered "not less than $50 a share" and the prospect of an offer "at a higher level, if warranted."
Until then, Los Angeles-based Northrop had pressed for "a merger of equals" that involved an exchange of stock, with Northrop as the succeeding corporation.
Grumman adviser Goldman, Sachs & Co. had suggested its client could get a higher value than that proposed in the Northrop discussions.
The purchase will make Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., the largest U.S. defense-electronics company.
Northrop officials couldn't be reached for comment yesterday on the contents of the filings.
The SEC documents say the Martin Marietta acquisition is expected to be complete by May 18.
