Airbus Industrie secured an order for six of its top-of-the-line A340 jetliners.
Although neither the buyer, Air Canada, nor the manufacturer disclosed the value of the deal, the A340 lists for $121.5 million without spare parts or training.
That would mean a total of about $729 million.
Air Canada won't be putting up the money itself.
Instead, the financing is being arranged by an undisclosed third party, with Air Canada taking over the planes on a long-term lease, an airline spokesman said.
The group also has options for an additional three A340s.
Airbus and Air Canada signed a memorandum of understanding on the sale in December.
In explaining its choice for the European-built jetliners, Air Canada cited its three-year experience flying the A320.
Both the four-engine, 260-seat A340 and the smaller A320 are similar for cockpit crews to fly.
Air Canada expects to use the new jetliners on its trans-Atlantic routes, where it flies aging Boeing Co. 747 jumbo jets.
Analysts said the deal reflects the trend among airlines to turn away from the 400-seat 747s on long-distance routes in favor of smaller aircraft that need fewer passengers to turn a profit.
"In the last 12 months there have been very few new orders for the Boeing 747, but there have been a steady flow of orders for the A340," said Keith Hodgkinson of Lehman Brothers International in London.
He noted that the Boeing 777 and 767, which compete with the Airbus A340 and its sister plane, the A330, are also selling well.
