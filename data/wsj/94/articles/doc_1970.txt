Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers wooed away Jack B. Grubman, one of the most well-known telecommunications analysts, to head its global telecommunications equity research team.
Mr. Grubman, 40 years old, was previously a managing director in PaineWebber Inc.'s equity research department.
He said he was attracted to Salomon's global presence and its large investment banking and underwriting operations in the telecommunications area.
"The industry is exploding, and the next two or three years" will determine the industry's direction for several decades, he said.
Although Salomon is expected to be a major player in helping a host of foreign governments privatize their state-run telephone companies, the brokerage firm lacked a prominent telecommunications analyst to lead the effort.
Mr. Grubman's position is new.
Mr. Grubman advised John Malone, chief executive of Tele-Communications Inc. after the cable company agreed to be acquired by Bell Atlantic Corp., a deal that has since fallen through.
Salomon Brothers, for its part, has played a significant role in advising telecommunications companies in several merger and acquisition transactions.
Bell Atlantic was its client in the proposed deal with TCI.
Salomon also advised Pacific Telesis Group in its plan to spin off its wireless communications operations.
"Institutional investors will continue to be my clients, but now I'll be traipsing around the world and just working harder," he said.
