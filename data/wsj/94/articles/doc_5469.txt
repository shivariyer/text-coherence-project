A shareholder filed a suit in U.S. District Court here against Longhorn Steaks Inc., five of its executives and two managing underwriters, alleging that the company misrepresented its growth prospects and inflated its stock.
The suit, which seeks to be considered as a class action, seeks unspecified damages.
The suit also condemns top executives for selling off some of their holdings prior to the collapse of the stock last spring, which resulted from lower-than-expected earnings reports.
The Atlanta company, which operates 46 steak restaurants in the Southeast, denied the allegations.
Ronald San Martin, chief financial officer, wouldn't comment on the suit.
But he said that the company has "curtailed our growth" this year and won't build the 18 restaurants it had planned.
Mr. San Martin said that the chain's founders, George McKerrow Sr. and George McKerrow Jr., held 40% of the company's shares until last March, after which point they sold off about half their holdings.
Mr. McKerrow Jr., chairman, couldn't be reached for comment.
