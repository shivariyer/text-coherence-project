Amber's Stores Inc. posted its first quarterly loss as a public company, citing discounted prices, a write-down of inventory and distribution problems resulting from rapid store expansion.
In the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, the Dallas arts and crafts retailer, which went public in 1992, posted a loss of $2 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $24.6 million.
A year earlier, Amber's had a profit of $1.4 million, or 28 cents a share, on sales of $18.1 million.
For fiscal 1994, Amber's had a loss of $1.5 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $2.7 million, or 65 cents a share.
Sales rose 47% to $62 million from $42.2 million.
The company also said its cash position at Jan. 31 had fallen to $503,000 from $1.6 million a year earlier, although chief financial officer Lamar Roberts said cash was not a concern because the company is slowing its expansion.
Merchandise inventories, even after the unspecified write-down, ballooned 84% to $26.5 million from $14.4 million a year earlier.
Stores open stood at 38, up from 24 a year earlier.
