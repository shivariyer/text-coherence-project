Acmat Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings were $1.1 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with a loss of $624,623, or 14 cents a share, a year ago.
The New Britain, Conn., company blamed the 1992 loss on an uncollectible receivable.
Net income for 1993 was $3.9 million, or 91 cents a share, up from $2.8 million, or 65 cents a share, in 1992.
"The superior results for 1993 reflect our dedication to the growth of profit and not revenue," said Henry W. Nozko Sr., chairman and chief executive officer.
"The 1993 operating earnings were the most profitable in our 43-year history."
Acmat designs, furnishes and installs interiors in commercial, industrial and institutional buildings and performs asbestos removal.
