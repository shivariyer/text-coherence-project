Wall Street may expect auto stock prices to go still higher, but the chief executives and some other senior officers at the Big Three U.S. auto makers are locking in profits now.
The biggest profits have been at Chrysler Corp., where Chairman Robert J. Eaton netted an indicated pretax profit of $2,659,387 through exercising stock options in transactions from August 1993 to Jan. 31, 1994, according to information filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Chrysler President Robert A. Lutz had a profit before taxes of $5.1 million on option-related stock transactions between August 2, 1993 and October 19, 1993, according to information filed with the SEC.
Separately, Chrysler Vice President Thomas C. Gale reported option-related stock transactions in August 1993 and October 1993 that yielded an indicated profit of $1,533,272.
Representatives of Chrysler, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. said decisions by executives to sell shares were personal, and don't reflect expectations about the direction of share prices.
Most of the sales appear to represent decisions by executives at GM, Ford and Chrysler to cash in options they received to buy stock at the depressed prices of 18 months to two years ago, and then promptly resell the acquired shares for prices that are now as many as four times higher.
Mr. Lutz, for example, used options to buy Chrysler shares for as little as $12.13 apiece, and sold them for prices ranging from $42.50 to $53.88 a share, thus more than quadrupling his money.
At GM, several senior executives took profits from stock options as the company headed for a fourth straight year without paying executive bonuses.
GM President John F. Smith Jr. reported pretax profits totaling $181,083 in option-related transactions executed on Feb. 17, 1994.
Mr. Smith purchased 17,860 GM shares and sold 13,893, according to SEC filings.
A GM spokeswoman said Mr. Smith and other senior GM officers still maintain significant holdings of GM stock.
Some of Mr. Smith's subordinates, however, were more aggressive in using option profits to make up for lost bonuses.
J. Michael Losh, GM's group vice president for North American sales and marketing, reported a profit of $683,327 on option-related transactions executed Feb. 15, 1994, according to SEC filings.
Mr. Losh exercised options to buy 23,045 GM shares at prices from $37.47 to $41.50 a share.
He then sold 26,045 shares the same day at $61.25 and $61.50 a share.
Another GM group vice president, E. Michael Mutchler, had pretax profit of $563,460 on option-related stock transactions executed Nov. 11, 1993, according to SEC filings.
Mr. Mutchler is head of GM's unprofitable North American passenger car operations.
At Ford, Chairman Alexander J. Trotman realized gains totaling $989,230 before taxes and expenses on option-related transactions executed April 8 and October 14, 1993, according to SEC filings.
Some other Big Three executives apparently agree with Wall Street analysts that the auto industry recovery has more room to run before it peaks.
GM Executive Vice President Harry J. Pearce, for example, so far has reported nothing but purchases since Dec. 31, 1992, his most recent being use of options to buy 8,250 GM common shares for $24.69 apiece on Jan. 14.
At Friday's closing price of $62.875, up 62.5 cents, those shares would have an indicated value of $518,718.75.
