General Electric Co.'s financial subsidiary said it acquired two Swedish concerns with about $379 million in assets under its plans to expand financing operations in Europe.
The companies are subsidiaries of Finans Skandic AB, a wholly owned unit of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, based in Stockholm.
One of the Swedish units is a computer-leasing company, and the other offers financing programs to dealers of office equipment and micro computers.
GE Capital, the Stamford, Conn., financial subsidiary, didn't disclose terms of the acquisition.
