Earnings at investment banker Morgan Stanley Group Inc. rose 28% in the fiscal fourth quarter, but that increase, coming amid a Wall Street boom, substantially lagged the industry.
The culprit at Morgan was nearly flat investment-banking revenue.
The company's fourth-quarter revenue from stock and bond underwriting and mergers advising was $245 million, 8% above the $227.9 million of a year earlier.
In contrast, Merrill Lynch & Co. showed a 45% gain in investment-banking revenue from the year-earlier quarter.
Last June, Morgan lost mergers ace Robert Greenhill, who left to become chairman of Smith Barney Shearson Inc., the brokerage unit of Travelers Inc.
Mr. Greenhill later served as adviser to Viacom Inc. on its takeovers of Paramount Communications Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., deals that reportedly resulted in more than $25 million in fees for Smith Barney.
Morgan's investment-banking revenue slid lower every quarter in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31.
First-quarter investment-banking revenue was $378.8 million, falling to $318.2 million in the second quarter and to $295.6 million in the third quarter.
Overall, Morgan's net income for the fourth quarter was $181.2 million, or $2.18 a share, up from $141.8 million, or $1.68 a share, a year earlier.
Per-share earnings came in slightly below analysts' expectations of $2.23 a share, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
In contrast, fourth-quarter net income at industry leader Merrill Lynch rose 57% from the year-earlier period and 37% at PaineWebber Group Inc.
However, their quarters ended a month earlier, on Dec. 31.
Morgan boosted its quarterly dividend 11% to 30 cents a share from 27 cents a share, payable March 24 to stock of record March 4.
The company also announced a $150 million stock buy-back program, which boosts its total buy-back authority to $252.9 million.
For the year, Morgan's net income rose 54% to $786.1 million, or $9.59 a share, from $510.5 million, or $5.90 a share, a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 16% to $2.08 billion from $1.80 billion a year earlier.
For the year, revenue rose 24% to $9.18 billion from $7.38 billion in the prior year.
Morgan's stock slipped on the earnings news, closing at $70 a share, down 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley said that the pace of underwriting slowed in January from December, and that Morgan's results are the first to reflect the industrywide decline.
