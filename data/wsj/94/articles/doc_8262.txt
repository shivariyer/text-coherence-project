Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen warned Russia that the receipt of international aid to support its economic reform efforts depends on Moscow's success in curbing inflation.
"I'm troubled by some of the indications we are getting out of Russia," Mr. Bentsen said here, where he stopped to press Japan to move forward in opening its markets to U.S. products.
"There is no way to have a healthy economy without controlling inflation, and no way to slow inflation without controlling budget deficits and credit growth."
During the Moscow summit 10 days ago, Mr. Bentsen praised President Boris Yeltsin's commitment to economic reform.
Since then, some leading reformers have quit the cabinet, and parliamentary leaders say they intend to slow efforts to control inflation, end subsidies to inefficient industries, and move to a market economy.
Separately, the governments that have lent about $54 billion to Russia agreed to extend a debt-restructuring arrangement they reached last year.
That agreement rescheduled about $15 billion of interest and principal payments that were due last year.
Although last year's agreement has expired, the terms will remain in place at least until April.
This year, Moscow is supposed to pay about $10 billion, but that will possibly be delayed in later negotiations.
