Digital Equipment Corp., boosting its leverage in the face of continuing losses, said it plans to offer $500 million of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares.
The computer maker will offer 20 million of the depositary shares at $25 apiece, each with a one-fourth interest in a new Series A cumulative preferred stock.
It will be Digital's first preferred-stock issue.
The dividend rate, redemption provisions and dividend payment dates will be established at the time of sale, expected to take place later this week.
The issue won't be convertible, Digital said.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Digital common shares closed at $32.375, up $1.375, or 4.4%, in heavy trading.
Digital, which until last year had virtually no long-term debt, now has $1 billion of debt with $1.2 billion of cash on hand.
It has cut its work force and expenses sharply and reported steep losses in the recent years, struggling with a difficult product transition.
Some analysts interpreted the offering as boosting the chances of a new charge against earnings.
Noting that Digital's last major financing came shortly after a $1.5 billion charge for layoffs and plant closings, Barry Willman of Goldman, Sachs & Co. said he expects a new charge for still more cuts to come sometime later this year.
A Digital spokesman declined comment, except to say that the new financing "would obviously give the company more flexibility."
