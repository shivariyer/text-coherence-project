Canadian manufacturers recorded a decline in shipments and new orders in January from a month earlier, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
Shipments fell in January for the second consecutive month, dropping 0.3% from December.
The decline resulted partly from a longshoremen's strike that stopped shipments through west coast Canadian ports for two weeks beginning in late January.
Statistics Canada said manufacturers' shipments in January rose 6.3% from a year earlier.
New orders fell 6.4% in January from December and unfilled orders declined 0.4%.
