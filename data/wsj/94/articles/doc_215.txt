Stora AB, Sweden's leading forest sector company, said it signed agreements to sell its forest interests in Chile for $100 million.
Stora, of Stockholm, will sell its 50% stake in Chilean forest company Forestal Valdivia SA to Chile's Arauco, which holds the remaining 50%.
The transaction will be carried out during the latter half of the year and will result in a $16 million gain for Stora.
Stora acquired the holding in Forestal Valdivia in 1989 for about $60 million with the intention to create a raw-materials base for a future pulp plant in Chile.
Stora said the situation changed as a result of the acquisition of Germany's Feldmuhle a year later.
