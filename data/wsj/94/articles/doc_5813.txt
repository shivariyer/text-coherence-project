Commonwealth Edison Co. said it asked state regulators for an average 8%, or $460.3 million, rate increase.
The Chicago utility said that if it is approved, the rate hike would likely become effective in 1995, because the Illinois Commerce Commission can take as long as 11 months to render a decision.
Edison contends that it must have higher rates if it is "to remain financially viable."
Its financial strength has been "compromised in recent years," it said, "because we have not received a rate increase since 1985 that was not later refunded -- except for a 2.7% increase in 1991."
Edison said its request seeks clearance to increase rates to residential customers by 3.6 percentage points more than the boost proposed for large commercial and industrial customers.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Commonwealth Edison closed at $26.375, down 75 cents.
