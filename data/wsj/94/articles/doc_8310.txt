Detroit Edison Co. said it will reduce electric rates for its nearly two million customers by $78 million, the second reduction in 13 months.
The reduction is in line with a Michigan Public Service Commission rate order issued Friday.
The rate reduction was scheduled to take effect Saturday .
More than a year ago the Detroit-based utility filed for a $113 million rate increase for 1994 to reflect increases in federal income-tax rates, certain required accounting changes and other items.
State regulators denied that request in October.
