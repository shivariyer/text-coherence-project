Shareholders of Eurotunnel PLC and Eurotunnel SA approved a previously announced plan to issue new shares to the Bombardier International unit of Bombardier Inc. upon delivery of 126 tourist cars and the first shuttle train.
Under the plan, 25 million new shares each of Eurotunnel PLC, listed in London, and Paris-listed Eurotunnel SA will be transferred to Bombardier if the tourist cars and first shuttle are delivered to the site by next Friday.
The shares are grouped into units, composed of one share each of Eurotunnel PLC and Eurotunnel SA.
Montreal-based Bombardier would be required to retain all the shares until the ninth and final shuttle is delivered.
That's scheduled for the beginning of 1995.
