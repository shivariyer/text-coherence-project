Canada proposed to lift and salvage the Irving Whale oil barge that sank off the country's east coast 24 years ago with a cargo of fuel oil, in an operation expected to cost about 10 million Canadian dollars (US$7.3 million).
The barge, which contains about 21,000 barrels of fuel oil, is considered a serious pollution threat to coastal waters and beaches.
It lies in 230 feet of water, 37 miles northeast of North Point, Prince Edward Island.
Environment Minister Sheila Copps said the government intends to proceed with the lifting of the tanker by the summer of 1995, provided the plan is supported by an environmental assessment and by a public consultation.
The vessel is owned by the Irving industrial group of New Brunswick.
It sank before the Canadian Parliament passed laws requiring polluters to pay for cleanups.
The government will try to recover as much of the salvage costs as possible from a Canadian shipowners' environment fund, an official said.
