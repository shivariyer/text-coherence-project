Italy's foreign trade deficit with countries outside the European Union narrowed to 192 billion lire ($114.1 million) in January from 829 billion lire a year earlier, according the state statistical office Istat.
Istat said the narrowed deficit could be attributed to increased penetration of foreign markets by traditionally strong industries such as textiles, clothing and metallurgy.
