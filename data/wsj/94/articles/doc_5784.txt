Barnes & Noble Inc., the nation's largest bookseller, said fiscal fourth-quarter revenue rose 19% to $484 million from $408 million a year ago.
For the full year, which ended Jan. 29, revenue rose 23%, to $1.34 billion from $1.09 billion.
The New York-based company said tight control on operating expenses helped it remain on plan, despite negative effects of the weather and the earthquake in January.
Fourth-quarter revenue at the company's superstores rose 66% to $230 million from $139 million, while same-superstore sales rose 7.6% in the quarter.
Same-superstore sales for stores opened by the company, excluding Bookstop and Bookstar stores acquired in 1989, rose 9% for the fourth quarter and 11.5% for the full year.
Same-store sales for the mall division fell 1.9% for the quarter and were virtually flat for the year.
Barnes & Noble operates 203 superstores under the Barnes & Noble, Bookstop and Bookstar names.
The company also has 734 mall stores under the B. Dalton Bookseller, Doubleday Book Shops and Scribner's Bookstore names.
