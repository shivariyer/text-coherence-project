Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, just days after his state settled charges of deceptive sales practices against New York-based Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., proposed stricter laws to govern the sale of life insurance.
The governor's action is the first legislative proposal to come out of the Met Life case, and other states, including Florida and New York, might follow.
Last week, Met Life agreed to pay $20 million in fines and reimburse as much as $76 million to policyholders to settle charges of misleading customers in several states.
The Pennsylvania law would require agents and brokers to disclose their commissions and fees to consumers.
Insurance companies would have to keep detailed records of sales in which a customer liquidates a life-insurance policy to buy a new one.
Agents and companies also would have to disclose expense and mortality charges.
Mortality charges represent the cost of buying a death benefit.
