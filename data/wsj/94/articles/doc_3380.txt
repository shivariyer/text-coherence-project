Casino America Inc. expects to report net income for its fiscal third quarter ended Jan. 31 in excess of $6 million, or between 57 cents and 60 cents a share, Julie Watt, chief financial officer, said.
Ms. Watt added that she expects the Boca Raton, Fla., riverboat gambling company to show quarterly revenue between $39 million and $41 million.
The results, expected to be announced next week, exceed projections of financial analysts, who were looking for per-share net of 45 cents to 50 cents.
In the third quarter a year ago, Casino America earned $4.7 million, or 46 cents a share, on revenue of $20.9 million.
In fiscal 1993, Casino America operated only one riverboat casino located in Biloxi, Miss.
It opened a facility in Vicksburg, Miss., last August, and plans to open a third casino in Bossier City, La., next month.
