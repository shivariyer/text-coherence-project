Bombay Co. said sales for the four-week period ended Sunday at stores open at least a year increased 17% from last year despite severe weather conditions and the California earthquake, which forced the closing of four stores there.
Total sales for the specialty retailer were $22.1 million, a 26% increase from the $17.5 million recorded for the four-week period ended Jan. 24, 1993.
Bombay said it has shifted its retail calendar, removing the high-sales week following Christmas from its January sales.
