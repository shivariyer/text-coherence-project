Small bankers are delighted that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into whether the networks that link automated teller machines are limiting their systems solely to banks that purchase other services from the networks.
Attorney General Janet Reno disclosed the antitrust investigation in a speech to the Independent Bankers Association of America at its annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.
If the department finds evidence of antitrust activity, she said, it will press the case in court.
"We were very pleased to hear the attorney general cite this as something they are looking into," said Diane Casey of the bankers association, a trade group of small banks.
"Our bankers need access to those systems."
The Justice Department opened the antitrust investigation after receiving complaints that ATM networks were pressuring bankers to purchase other services from the networks.
Banks, for instance, could allow their customers to pay bills by telephone or through personal computers, if the bank purchased the service through the network.
