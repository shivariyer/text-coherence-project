The National Association of Securities Dealers said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month to eliminate and replace its Small Order Execution System.
The NASD, which operates and regulates the Nasdaq Stock Market, asked the SEC on March 4 to replace SOES with a new, automated small-order execution system with "enhancements for limit orders and market-makers processing of incoming orders," according to a spokesman.
James D. Spellman, manager of media relations at the NASD, said the proposal is pending before the SEC.
The new system, dubbed Nasdaq Primary Retail Order View & Execution System, won't probably be implemented until next year as software and system changes will first be necessary.
SOES was created after the 1987 stock-market crash to ensure that small investors get their orders executed, even when trading is hectic.
Through SOES, small orders are automatically executed via computer instead of by telephone.
Nasdaq phone lines went down during the crash, and some investors said their orders went unfilled.
