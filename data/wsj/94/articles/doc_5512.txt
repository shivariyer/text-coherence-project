JVC/Victor Co. of Japan named Barr B. Potter chairman and chief executive officer of its Largo Entertainment unit.
The move completes a shift in focus at Largo, which had been primarily a movie-production company.
Largo said it now plans to acquire, finance and distribute movies in the international market.
Major changes at the company were foreshadowed last month when 57-year-old producer Larry Gordon, for whom Largo is named, resigned as chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Potter, 45, initially joined JVC, which is 51% owned by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., as an executive vice president in 1991.
He became president, chief operating officer and a member of the board of directors in July 1992.
