Remember the great New Jersey GOP vote suppression story?
To recap, state and federal officials found no evidence that New Jersey Republicans used "street money" to suppress turnout in black areas.
Suppressing Cheshire grins, the GOP legislature passed a law requiring all future street money to be paid by check, not cash.
Somehow, not one Democratic legislator voted for the bill, which outgoing Governor Jim Florio signed into law.
Election records now reveal who spent what on "street money": New Jersey Democrats hired 20,000 poll workers with $519,000 in untraceable street money, outspending Republicans by more than 12 times.
Meanwhile, the voting fraud case in next-door Pennsylvania only gets meatier.
Democrats there retained control of the State Senate by winning a squeaker election in which more than 80% of absentee ballots went for Democrat Bill Stinson.
But hundreds of Philadelphia voters now say they were misled into voting for him by Democratic workers who went door-to-door with absentee ballots in hand.
Now it develops that Mr. Stinson unlocked voting machines at his polling place on Election Day and then opened and counted sealed absentee ballots that night.
He says he was only helping his mother, who happens to be the local election judge.
The city's deputy solicitor says Senator Stinson is "chargeable" for violating election laws.
The Philadelphia Inquirer thinks all this would be "enough to prompt some to resign in shame," but the senator is hanging tough.
So far there's been no national media interest in this scandal which, unlike New Jersey's, turned out to be real.
