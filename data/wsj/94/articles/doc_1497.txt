Virginia Power Co., Richmond, Va., said it will offer an early-retirement and a buyout program to salaried employees in a bid to trim staff and cut costs.
The electric utility unit of Dominion Resources Inc. predicted that between 500 and 700 employees will take one of the two offers.
Virginia Power said it plans to offer the same programs to its 4,100 employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
In addition, the company said it would conduct a comprehensive study of workplace practices this year in order to cut costs and improve its competitive position.
The utility, which has about 12,000 employees, has cut 2,000 jobs in the past five years, mainly through attrition.
