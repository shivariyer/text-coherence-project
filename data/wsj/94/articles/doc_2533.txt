The 3DO Co., taking more steps to perk up sales of its pricey video-game players, licensed two new manufacturers and set plans to make the machines compatible with more software.
The two new licensees are GoldStar Co. and Samsung Electronics Ltd.
But in a press release, 3DO said the two companies have "not announced specific plans at this time" for manufacturing or marketing.
Currently, the only company manufacturing the machines is Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
On the software side, 3DO said it reached a preliminary agreement with Creative Technology Ltd. of Singapore to jointly develop a card that allows personal computers to run software written for 3DO game players.
Creative Technology would license, manufacture and market the card.
Also, 3DO formed a unit to develop, publish and distribute software titles -- including titles by third-party vendors -- that take advantage of graphics and interactive features of 3DO players.
