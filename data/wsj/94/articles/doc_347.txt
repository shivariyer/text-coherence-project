Crown Cork & Seal Co. said it plans to begin recycling plastic packaging through its Nationwide Recyclers Inc. subsidiary.
The unit, which already recycles used aluminum and bimetallic beverage cans, is building a new $6 million plastics recycling center in North Carolina, which is expected to open in June.
The facility will be able to process about 40 million pounds a year of used polyethylene terephthalate and high density polyethylene containers.
The material will be ground, washed and repelletized for use in the production of new containers.
Crown Cork is a Philadelphia-based world-wide producer of metal and plastic containers, crowns, closures and packaging machinery.
