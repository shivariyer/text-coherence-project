Rising interest rates at home and political instability abroad sent the stock market into a tailspin.
After tumbling as much as 66 points during the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 48.37 points lower at 3821.09, its lowest closing level since March 1.

Also shaking investor confidence was the assassination of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio.
Mr. Colosio, who was perceived as a sure winner in the presidential election, was expected to continue the modernization policies of the Carlos Salinas de Gortari administration.
But even though Mr. Colosio's death was mourned world-wide, few analysts believed that it would derail Mexico from the path of modernization.
"The inflation worries about the bond market are more imagined than real and, secondly, while the episode in Mexico is terribly unfortunate in human terms, I don't think it will be significant enough to deter investors from investing in U.S. stocks over the long term," said Steven Einhorn, stock strategist at Goldman Sachs.
Mr. Einhorn explained that there was some fear initially that U.S. stock investors, who have also been eager investors in Latin America, might pull back from the U.S. market when they discover capital losses in their Latin American investments.
But while Mr. Einhorn thinks U.S. stocks could fall a few percent more, he believes the prospect of low inflation and improving corporate profits will lure investors back to the market.
