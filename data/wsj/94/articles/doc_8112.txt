Germany's Dresdner Bank AG said it will consider court action over searches of its Duesseldorf and Frankfurt offices by the prosecutor's office and tax officials.
About 40 government officials have been searching offices since Jan. 11, alleging that employees helped transfer illegal funds to Luxembourg.
In a news release, Dresdner Bank described transactions in question as "in complete accord" with tax laws, saying such transactions occur thousands of times daily in the German banking system.
The bank claimed the investigation is using bank employees as a pretext to obtain illegal access to information on an unknown number of customers.
It also criticized the tactics used by the investigators, saying for instance that employees were threatened with force several times.
