DUAL DRILLING Co., Dallas, said it will sell $100 million of senior subordinated notes due 2004 at an interest rate of 9 7/8%.
The offshore-drilling company plans to use the proceeds, about $96.5 million, to repay $86.6 million of existing debt and to pay part of the cost to acquire offshore-drilling equipment.
Dual also said it obtained new financing: $25 million of revolving credit, a $10 million term loan and a $15 million bond.
It said the term loan will be used to pay the remaining cost of the offshore-drilling equipment.
