AlliedSignal Inc. posted a 29% increase in fourth-quarter profit, declared a 2-for-1 stock split, and raised its quarterly dividend 16%, capping the results of a company-wide restructuring effort.
Fourth-quarter profit rose to $178 million, or $1.25 a share, from $138 million, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier.
The profit was higher than Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate of $1.20, compiled by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose slightly to $3.06 billion from $3.05 billion.
The company said it will pay holders five cents a presplit share for redemption of common-share purchase rights.
It will be paid along with the current 29 cent-a-share quarterly dividend on March 10 to stock of record Feb. 18.
The rights were authorized by AlliedSignal's board in 1986 as a poison pill designed to make a hostile takeover more difficult.
The stock split will use the stock previously reserved for the rights.
The share split follows a 31% increase in the price of AlliedSignal shares over the last year.
The additional share for each share owned will be distributed on March 14 to stock of record Feb. 22.
The maker of automotive and aerospace products and engineered materials, based in Morris Township, N.J., said it intends to raise its quarterly common-stock dividend to 33.5 cents a share, on a presplit basis to be paid beginning with the second-quarter payment.
The net effect is that by the end of the second quarter, each shareholder will have twice as many shares with each share paying a dividend of 16.75 cents a share.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AlliedSignal stock closed yesterday at $77.375, up $1.50.
Lawrence A. Bossidy, chairman, said the stock split and the dividend action reflect the improved 1993 performance and "our confidence that in 1994 we will again deliver strong earnings growth and positive cash flow."
Mr. Bossidy said in an interview that he expects 1994 profit to increase 13% to 17%, which will bring per-share net income to $5.23 to $5.42.
That will compare with the $4.63 a share, before accounting changes, reported yesterday for 1993.
He estimated 1994 sales will increase 4% to 6%.
The latest fourth-quarter results brought net income for all of 1993 to $656 million, a 23% increase from the $535 million, or $3.80 a share, before accounting changes adopted in both years.
After the accounting charges, 1993 net income was $411 million, or $2.90 a share, compared with a 1992 loss of $712 million, or $5.05 share.
Sales in 1993 declined 2% to $11.83 billion from $12.04 billion a year earlier.
The sharply improved performance in 1993 largely reflects the success of Mr. Bossidy's restructuring of the company, which he instituted soon after he took over on July 1, 1991, as chief executive officer.
"We have a solid foundation now," he said, adding that the "overhaul" will make further "payoffs" this year.
