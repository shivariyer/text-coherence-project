The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index slipped a bit in early March, to 92.1 from 93.2 in February, according to market participants who have seen the report.
The university's index for consumer expectations was up, however, to 84.9 from 83.5.
The consumer sentiment index had also fallen in February, as did the consumer confidence index published by the Conference Board.
Analysts blamed the declines on bad weather.
