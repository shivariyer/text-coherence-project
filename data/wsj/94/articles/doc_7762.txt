Fleet Financial Group Inc., Providence, R.I., said it has been awarded a 10-year contract by New York's Department of Taxation and Finance to process the state's 10 million personal income tax returns.
A spokesman for the financial services company estimated the value of the contract at $197 million.
The contract includes reviewing returns for completeness and data entry.
Fleet also will handle the depositing of estimated tax payments and expanding the electronic income-tax filing system.
The spokesman said Fleet expects to gradually phase in the new processing and to be handling all of the state's tax returns by the end of 1995.
Several hundred employees are expected to be hired.
