BCE Inc. and Jones Intercable Inc. confirmed that they are trimming by 5% the amount BCE will pay for a 30% stake in Jones, as a result of new U.S. cable-rate restrictions.
As expected, the companies said BCE's international-investment unit will pay $261 million for its stake in the Denver-based cable company, down from the $275 million originally planned.
The BCE unit, Bell Canada International Inc., also confirmed that it remains committed to increasing its investment in Jones to $400 million over time; the additional $139 million would help finance Jones's growth and maintain BCE's stake at 30%.
BCE said it is investing $55 million of the initial $261 million immediately, enabling the companies "to begin their business and growth strategies for Jones" before formal completion of their alliance, expected by midsummer.
BCE, Montreal, is Canada's biggest telecommunications company.
