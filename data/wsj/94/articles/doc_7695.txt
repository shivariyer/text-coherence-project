How speculative does something have to be before you fail to mention it in your editorials?
Your Jan. 18 attempt to somehow link BCCI, Whitewater and James McDougal to Stephens is absurd.
Since no one has bothered to ask, I thought I would give you the time frame in which these events occurred.
The stock purchases in First American Bank, by what we (and everyone else) thought were four individuals acting on their own behalf, occurred in 1977.
That was the last we heard from them.
Apparently, in 1982 and 1983 Worthen Bank loaned James McDougal a total of $250,000 to first buy into and then acquire control in Madison Guaranty.
These loans occurred before our investment in Worthen in November 1983.
I am informed that Worthen subsequently charged off $100,000 of these loans in 1987, closing its books on the subject.
The Worthen loan to the Clinton campaign, which as I have explained before, was secured by receivables from the Federal Election Commission, was made in 1992.
We first learned of this loan from local newspaper accounts.
How you can possibly suggest there is a connection between these totally unrelated events is beyond me.
Linking them together in one paragraph (as you have now done twice) is truly a modern journalistic feat.
You are deliberately compressing this time line to suit your views.
We expected that you would try, but we never dreamed you would ignore the total time frame and the elapsed time between these events.
Your deliberate creation of the false impression that these events overlap, and are connected, just continues the malicious pattern of The Wall Street Journal toward our firm and family.
