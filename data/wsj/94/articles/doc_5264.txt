Concerning your Jan. 27 article "Prostate-Cancer Study Supports Go-Slow Tactics": I had the radical prostatectomy surgery last November at M.D. Anderson, Cancer and Tumor Hospital here in Houston.
My prostate cancer ranked 7 on the Gleason Score, with 10 being the most aggressive.
This cancer was discovered via the PSA test (6.4) and the Digital Test.
Then it was located by ultrasound and a biopsy was done.
For the next month I underwent tests to see if the cancer had metastasized to other parts of my body.
I thank the Lord that in my case it had not.
If I had not discovered the cancer and had it removed, I surely would have died within the next few years, just as Bill Bixby and Frank Zappa did.
This disease is rampant in the U.S. in men and with the testing procedures available there is no reason to die of it.
There are different levels of care, depending on the aggressiveness of the cancer and the age of the patient, but to do nothing is like sitting in a leaking boat in the middle of the ocean without a life vest.
Maybe you won't drown, but chances are you will.
The doctor referred to my cancer as "an angry tumor," so the incontinence (which lasts only from three to seven months in most cases) and impotence (there are devices that overcome this) were of no consequence when considering life or death.
The figure of 38,000 men expected to die this year of prostate cancer should tell anyone this is nothing to procrastinate over.
