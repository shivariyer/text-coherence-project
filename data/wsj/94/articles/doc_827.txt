Baker Hughes Inc., Houston, said it plans to sell its EnviroTech Pumpsystems unit.
A company spokesman wouldn't comment on the selling price.
But he said the unit, which had fiscal 1993 revenue of $220 million, had pretax profit between $17.6 million and $22 million.
The spokesman said more than a dozen companies have expressed an interest in buying the unit, and Baker Hughes hopes to complete a sale before the end of its fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
Baker Hughes provides services and products for the oil and natural-gas industry.
The company said sale of the unit, which provides specialized pumps to the mineral, mining, chemical, petrochemical and municipal markets, is part of a decision to concentrate on core businesses in the oil, gas and process industries.
