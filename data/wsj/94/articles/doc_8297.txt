Nissan Motor Co. said it will end production of some of its compact cars by Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., cutting a key lifeline to the small Japanese auto maker.
Fuji Heavy, the maker of Subaru cars and a 4.2%-owned affiliate of Nissan, has been producing 60,000 Pulsar compact cars annually for Nissan since 1991.
A Nissan spokesman said the two companies will stop the arrangement when the original contract expires early next year.
The supply deal has been important to Fuji Heavy, which expects to post a 29 billion yen ($260 million) pretax loss for fiscal 1994, ending March 31.
Pulsar production accounts for about 10% of the cars Fuji Heavy makes, and Pulsar sales account for 8% of Fuji Heavy's revenue.
Pulsars are sold in Japan and in Europe.
Canceling the deal makes sense for Nissan because it will allow Japan's ailing No. 2 auto maker to make better use of its idle domestic factories.
Nissan's vehicle output in Japan plunged 14.5% in calendar 1993, and the company expects to post a 40 billion yen operating loss for fiscal 1994, ending March 31.
