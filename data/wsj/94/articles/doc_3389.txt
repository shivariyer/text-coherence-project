Gantos Inc., a women's wear retailer, said it had February sales of $12.7 million, unchanged from the same period a year ago.
The company said it adjusted its net sales figures for February last year to exclude sales from the 41 stores that it closed in the fourth quarter.
Gantos now operates 118 stores.
