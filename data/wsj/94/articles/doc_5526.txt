Royal Dutch/Shell Group and British Petroleum Co. on Friday opened the 450 million rand ($130.5 million) extension to their joint Sapref refinery in Durban.
The project is the largest investment by Shell and BP in South Africa in more than 20 years, the two companies said, and will increase Sapref's 200,000 barrel-a-day capacity by 35%.
Under South Africa's Petroleum Products Act of 1977, it is illegal to publish production figures.
(The law was passed amid concern that the country wouldn't be able to buy crude oil because of anti-apartheid oil embargoes.)
However, it's estimated that Shell and BP each control about 17% of the market share of South African refined oil.
South Africa's fuel consumption has been growing at an annual rate of 4.0%, prompting all the refineries to implement expansion programs three years ago.
South Africa's total refining capacity is estimated at 430,000 barrels a day, with total oil refined at 390,000 barrels a day.
The Sapref extension took three years to build, was completed three months ahead of schedule and met all budget requirements, the two oil groups said.
