ALC Communications Corp., Bingham Farms, Mich., said it backs forecasts of a 35% to 50% increase in first-quarter operating profit and a 26% to 36% rise for 1994.
The company cited economic recovery and a rise in long-distance calling by small and midsize businesses.
Chief Financial Officer Marvin C. Moses said ALC is comfortable with first-quarter earnings estimates of 31 cents to 35 cents a share.
The company earned $21.5 million, or 61 cents a share, on revenue of $101.8 million in the year-earlier quarter, including a gain of 38 cents a share for the adoption of new accounting standards.
On an operating basis, ALC had profit of $8 million, or 23 cents a share, in the 1993 first quarter.
ALC buys access to nationwide and regional long-distance networks in bulk and sells time to subscribers at a discount.
"There's the prospect" the company can exceed profit projections of $1.35 to $1.45 a share for 1994 with revenue growth and sales "comfortably in excess of $500 million without any acquisitions," Mr. Moses said.
