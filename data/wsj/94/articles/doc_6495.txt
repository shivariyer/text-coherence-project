For a dozen years I have owned and operated ministorages in our semirural area.
Accordingly, I was more than angry when I read the article "Chambers of Horrors" on Jan. 5.
The article described the many things left in self-storage lockers, including the bodies of murder victims.
The things you have discussed happen in any occupied building, condo, apartment house, general warehouse or industrial building.
Because Gacy buried bodies in his backyard, should we allow police to inspect every rental house?
Likewise for your conclusions.
We still expect all but a very small minority of citizens to be law-abiding.
Your article implies the contrary.
That itself is a sad commentary on your view of our society, not just mini-storages.
