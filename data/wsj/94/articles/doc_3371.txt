Motorola Inc. announced a 15% price cut on its PowerPC 601 microprocessor, in the latest round of the price war that has preceded the chip's planned debut later this month as the brains of a new generation of personal computers.
Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said its microprocessor division now will sell the PowerPC 601 for as low as $238, when purchased in volumes of 20,000.
The PowerPC 601 microprocessor has been adopted by Apple Computer Inc., International Business Machines Corp. and others as their answer to Intel Corp.'s powerful new Pentium chip.
Motorola's price move yesterday is but the latest salvo in the battle in the chip market.
Intel cut the price of the Pentium, and IBM reduced the price of its PowerPC in recent weeks, as the rivals continue to jockey for a competitive advantage.
