French retail and distribution group Pinault-Printemps SA said it would merge with its 54.4%-controlled La Redoute SA mail-order unit by the end of the second quarter.
The merger will involve an exchange of La Redoute shares for Pinault-Printemps shares at par.
But first, current Pinault-Printemps shareholders will receive one free share for every 10 held.
La Redoute will be recreated as a 100%-owned unit.
Share trading in both Pinault-Printemps and La Redoute was suspended Friday on the Paris Bourse pending the announcement.
Pinault-Printemps ended Thursday at 995 francs ($169) a share, while La Redoute settled at 960 francs.
Pinault-Printemps officials declined to say what the new company's capital would look like after the operation, other than to say that Artemis, the Pinault family holding company that controls Pinault-Printemps, would have more than one-third of the company's capital and voting rights.
Artemis holds 52.2% of Pinault-Printemps' voting rights and 45.3% of its capital.
Other shareholders are Clinvest, a unit of Credit Lyonnais SA, with 4.5% of the voting rights and 3.9% of the capital.
Credit Lyonnais has been the faithful banker of Francois Pinault, the Breton businessman who took over retailer Au Printemps SA in a contested takeover a few years ago that lead to a reform of French takeover law to better protect minority interests.
Various other banks and insurance companies control 8.5% of the voting rights and 7.4% of the capital.
