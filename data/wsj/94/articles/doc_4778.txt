Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling 416,400 of its 1992, 1993 and 1994 model cars and trucks for two separate problems.
In the first action, Ford is recalling 400,000 of its 1993 and 1994 F-Series trucks and Bronco sport-utility vehicles because nuts that attach the vehicles' front bumpers might fracture under normal operating conditions.
If such a break occurs, the front bumper might loosen, rattle or separate from the frame.
In the second action, Ford is recalling 16,400 of its 1992 and 1993 model Crown Victoria police, fleet and taxi vehicles equipped with manual front seats and rubber floor mats.
Ford said power-seat wiring connectors under the front seats might touch the floor and be exposed to water and road salt brought into the car by occupants.
Prolonged exposure to salt water could corrode the wiring and cause a short, which could lead to a fire.
Ford, Dearborn, Mich., said it isn't aware of any accidents or injuries related to either problem.
