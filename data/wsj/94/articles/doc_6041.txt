Southwest Airlines said its January traffic, including Morris Air, increased 25.3%.
The airline reported revenue passenger miles of 1.60 billion for the month, up from 1.28 billion for January 1993.
A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile.
Load factor, or the percentage of available seats filled, increased to 63.1% from 62.9% a year earlier.
Southwest said it restated 1993 traffic statistics to include those of Morris Air, which it acquired Dec. 31, 1993.
