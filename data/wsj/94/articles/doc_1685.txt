In "A Class Opportunity to Sue" (editorial page, March 8), Charles E.M. Kolb refers to my participation at a National Academy of Sciences panel discussion entitled "Opportunity to Learn -- Opportunity to Sue" to support his argument that the "opportunity to learn" standards in the Clinton administration's school reform bills now pending in Congress are a misguided effort to improve schools that will result only in more litigation.
Had Mr. Kolb bothered to attend the meeting before writing, he would have learned that the title he attacks was intended to frame the issue, not answer it, and that my primary point is that opportunity to learn standards are not an opportunity to sue.
He would have learned further that it is the bills' separate "content" and "performance" standards, through which states, not the federal government, will define what students should know and be able to do that will be of primary interest to the courts.
Opportunity-to-learn standards are important because they recognize that many school districts -- most often those serving poor students -- lack the programs, personnel and resources that students need in order to meet the new content standards.
Finally, had he come to the conference, he would have learned that enactment of these bills will achieve exactly what he wants: they will focus the attention of the country, and also the courts, upon educational outcomes.
But he didn't wait to hear what I had to say; his column appeared the day before I spoke.
And although he registered for the conference, he didn't even bother to attend.
