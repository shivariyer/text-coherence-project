Nike Inc., hit by the changing tastes of athletic shoe buyers, a slump in orders and unfavorable foreign currency rates, said fiscal third-quarter net income fell 29% to $63.2 million, or 85 cents a share.
That compares with net of $89.5 million, or $1.16 a share, a year ago.
The results were within analysts' expectations, who, according to Zack's Investment Research Inc., forecast a mean average of 89 cents a share.
Revenue for the period ended Feb. 28 slid 10% to $871.8 million.
Chairman Philip H. Knight said Nike expects to resume growth in the next fiscal year.
He said world-wide orders for the fiscal first quarter climbed 4% from a year earlier, the biggest gain in more than a year.
Nike shares rose $1, to $54.50, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
