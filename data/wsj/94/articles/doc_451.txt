Crane Co. stepped up its efforts to acquire Mark Controls Corp., announcing plans for a $19.50-a-share tender offer for the Skokie, Ill., maker of industrial valves.
Crane's offer, which values Mark Controls at about $99.5 million, narrowly tops a previous $19-a-share tender offer from Tyco International Ltd., a maker of fire-protection equipment in Exeter, N.H.
Crane, which currently holds 13% of Mark Controls, said its offer will begin soon and will be subject to usual conditions, including the tender of a majority of shares outstanding.
Earlier this month, Mark directors had endorsed a $17.75-a-share offer, or about $89 million, from Danaher Corp., Washington, D.C., but the stock price has risen amid the various expressions of interest.
William E. Bendix, Mark Controls' chief executive officer, said he was "pleased with Crane's renewed interest" in acquiring the company, noting that "at these prices, the offers are getting closer to a full valuation" of Mark Controls.
He said the company's board would meet soon to decide whether to endorse the Crane bid.
Crane previously had offered $15.50 a share.
Tyco couldn't be reached for comment.
Shares of Mark Controls closed unchanged at $19.25 a share yesterday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while shares of Crane closed at $27.75 a share, down 50 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
