International Multifoods Corp., Minneapolis, said it agreed to sell the meats business of its prepared-foods division to IBP Inc.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The company recently disclosed that it would recognize a pretax loss of $22 million on the planned sale for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Feb. 28, but it didn't disclose the buyer at the time.
In the year-earlier quarter, the food-processing and specialty-distribution concern earned $10.6 million, or 55 cents a share, on sales of $537.1 million.
International Multifoods said the decision to sell the meats business, as well as the recent agreement to sell its frozen specialty-foods business to Doskocil Cos., reflect its plan to concentrate on lines in which it has market advantages and the best opportunities for growth -- bakery and specialty distribution.
The transaction is expected to be completed in late April or early May.
