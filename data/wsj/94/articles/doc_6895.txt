A jump in bond prices helped push stocks higher.
The dollar rose.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 11.53 points to 3975.54, just shy of its record of 3978.36.
Standard & Poor's 500stock index rose 2.38 to a record 482.00, and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2.33 to 799.57.
Bond prices recovered from Tuesday's tumble as traders largely ignored further signs of an improving economy and focused instead on expectations that the Federal Reserve Board will act to head off inflationary pressures, if they arise.
Richard B. Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said many traders regarded a sharp jump in December new-home sales as old news, especially as it fails to take into account the severe winter and Los Angeles earthquake that are likely to disrupt January home sales.
"The market may be looking through the strong numbers to a pronounced dropoff in January," Mr. Berner said.
Bond traders also were encouraged that yesterday's announcement of the Treasury's plans for its quarterly refunding was in line with expectations.
