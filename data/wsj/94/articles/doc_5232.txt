Boise Cascade Corp., Boise, Idaho, said it will consolidate most of its unprofitable newsprint and uncoated groundwood paper used for catalogs, into its Canadian unit and may sell an equity stake in the unit.
The unit will be managed independently and will have access to financial markets, Boise said.
That means the unit might issue stock, or parts of it might be sold, a spokesman said.
He said the details will be hammered out in coming months.
The company said the move is part of its long-term plan to invest in coated and uncoated white paper, even though those businesses also are unprofitable, with prices at a 60-year low.
"We do expect them to rebound, and when they do, we want to be in position to take advantage of that resurgence," a spokesman said.
