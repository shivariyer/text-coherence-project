Bond prices rallied, recovering a fraction of the big losses of recent weeks.
Stocks were mixed, and the dollar fell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 6.76 points to 3832.02.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.07 to 467.14.
The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 8.72 to 792.50, led by a sharp rebound in communications stocks.
Analysts said the bond market was due to bounce back, but not for a sustained recovery.
The rally pushed the long-term bond yield to 6.65% from 6.71% Friday.
That's still far above the 6.31% the long bond yielded just before the Federal Reserve Board boosted short-term interest rates on Feb. 4.
"We're in a typical cyclical bear market for bonds, with the economy growing and the Federal Reserve raising rates," said James M. Snyder, director of fixed-income management at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
The industrial average was up for most of the day, but faded in late trading.
Leading the decline was Philip Morris, which sank 2 to 56 on fears of increased regulation of the tobacco industry.
Walter C. Revis, market analyst at Hamilton Investments in Chicago, noted that the industrial average is now underperforming the broader market.
"The correction is hitting the Dow a little harder because the Dow had been outpacing the broader market," he said.
Overseas markets provided some underlying strength to U.S. stocks.
After a dismal performance last week, European bond markets rallied and stock markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt climbed 1.4% to 1.8%.
Germany's central bank made technical changes in the way it will set money market interest rates, a move investors interpreted as auguring lower rates throughout Europe.
But Nicholas Stevenson, a European equity strategist at S.G. Warburg & Co., said he thinks Europe's bond prices are headed down.
He warned that Swiss stocks, which fell 1.8%, could be a harbinger for Europe's stock markets.
Switzerland "cut interest rates first and had a bull market first," he said.
"Maybe they're the first ones to fade."
World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 1.02 to 116.74.
Stock prices were mixed.
Volume totaled 267.4 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,457 issues rose and 727 fell.
Bonds rose.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/8 point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
The dollar fell.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.7041 marks and 104.50 yen compared with 1.7100 marks and 104.85 yen Friday.
