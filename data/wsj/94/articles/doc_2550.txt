Jackson Products Inc., a safety-equipment manufacturer owned by investment firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc., acquired Lukens Inc.'s safety-products group.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The group, which sells highway-safety products, including reflective tape and paint, had 1993 sales of about $61 million.
The acquisition will give Jackson, which Hicks Muse acquired last April, more than $100 million in sales, James M. Mills, chairman and chief executive officer of Jackson, said in Dallas.
Mr. Mills said Jackson, a supplier of equipment designed to protect the eyes, face and head, is looking at other possible acquisitions in the safety-products area.
He said Jackson plans to grow by acquisitions into a company with annual sales of $200 million to $300 million.
Lukens is a steel maker based in Coatesville, Pa.
