The New York Stock Exchange has cut back on the program-trading data it releases.
The exchange no longer discloses the most-active program trading firms during periods in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves 50 points within an hour.
Under the old policy, the exchange yesterday would have disclosed who did the most trading on the morning of March 2, when the Dow industrials plunged 50 points before shooting back upward.
But the exchange didn't do so when it released its regular program-trading statistics.
The information cutback reverses a trend since the 1987 stock-market crash, in which the Big Board had been releasing more program data -- and doing so more quickly -- in response to investors' concerns about the computer-guided trading activity.
"Our experience shows that doing that chart was of no real informational value," a Big Board spokesman explained yesterday.
For example, there was actually more program buying than selling during the March 2 plunge; "therefore, it seems of little value to identify who is buying and selling via programs."
But program-trading critics say they want more information, not less.
"I think people are caring even more about program trading," said Dale Holzen, a Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. broker in Cocoa Beach, Fla.
"Especially on the downside, they're going to care."
