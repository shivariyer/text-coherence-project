Epic Healthcare Group Inc. and Healthtrust Inc. were sued by a not-for-profit hospital in Gulfport, Miss., over an alleged breach of contract.
The suit, filed in Chancery Court of Harrison County by Memorial Hospital seeks to force Epic to fulfill the contract, or to block the planned acquisition of Epic, a hospital chain in Dallas, by Healthtrust, a hospital chain in Nashville, Tenn.
Memorial said it agreed in December to buy Garden Park Community Hospital in Gulfport, from Epic for $23.3 million, plus working capital.
In January, Healthtrust said it would acquire closely held Epic for $277 million in cash and the assumption of $727 million in debt.
Memorial Hospital, in its suit, claims that Epic, a unit of Epic Holdings Inc., backed out of the sale several weeks after the acquisition was announced.
Executives at Epic declined to comment.
A spokeswoman for Healthtrust said the company hadn't seen the suit, but that Healthtrust believes that Epic never signed any contract -- even a letter of intent -- to sell Garden Park to Memorial.
