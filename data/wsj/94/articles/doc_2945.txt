Maybelline Inc. hired Gerald Beddall, a former president of Clairol Inc., drawing speculation that the cosmetics marketer may want to expand into the hair care business.
Mr. Beddall, 51 years old, was named to the newly created position of executive vice president in charge of growth areas, acquisitions and strategic planning.
"Maybelline is trying to move away from being totally reliant on facial makeup," said Allan Mottus, an industry consultant who noted that 75% of Clairol's business is in hair coloring.
"Gerry brings a background of running very large toiletry brands."
While he declined to provide specifics, Maybelline President and Chief Executive Robert N. Hiatt left open the possibility of a move into hair care products.
"Our priorities are personal care products marketed through mass market channels that are compatible with our existing sales and distribution network," he said.
Hair care "obviously fits into that definition."
In recent years, Maybelline, which has been historically strong in mascaras and eyeshadows among younger consumers, has aggressively expanded its product line to appeal to aging baby boomers.
It has also been using its recently acquired rights to the Yardley brand name to expand into specialty bath care products in the U.S. and Canada.
In his new position, Mr. Beddall will be responsible for such growth areas as Maybelline International, Yardley North America, research and development, and other "business development opportunities."
In addition to his 19 years at Clairol's parent Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Mr. Beddall also held marketing positions for Colgate Palmolive Co. in London and most recently was president and CEO of New York-based Helia International USA, a skincare distributor.
