Bowing to regulatory and congressional complaints, major banking trade groups are planning to recommend that customers be required to sign statements that they understand mutual funds they buy through banks are uninsured.
In nonbinding guidelines issued in July, the Comptroller of the Currency made the same recommendation, although many banks declined to do so.
Regulators and legislators have become increasingly uncomfortable with anecdotal evidence that bank employees, some of them tellers, were offering equity-based investments to unsophisticated consumers who mistakenly believed that they were buying products which were backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Banking groups expected to adopt the policy include the American Bankers Association, the Independent Bankers Association of America, the National Bankers Association, the Bankers Roundtable, the Consumer Bankers Association, and the Savings and Community Bankers of America.
