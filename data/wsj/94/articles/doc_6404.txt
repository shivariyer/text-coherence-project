Loral Corp. won a $109 million contract to continue production of the Army's Multiple Launch Rocket System in 1994.
The company said its Vought Systems unit, based in Texas, will produce 34 launchers and 167 reduced-range practice rocket pods for the Army.
Deliveries extend through March 1997.
Most of the work will be performed at the company's Camden, Ark., plant.
