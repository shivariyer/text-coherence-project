Deckers Outdoor Corp. expects to report fourth-quarter net income of between $1.1 million and $1.3 million, or 12 cents to 14 cents a share, meeting or slightly exceeding analysts' estimates.
Sales for the quarter jumped 40% to about $11.8 million from $8.4 million a year earlier, Douglas Otto, president and chief executive officer, said in an interview.
"We've had continued high demand for the Teva sports sandal line, and encouraging results from new lines," Mr. Otto said.
Analysts had expected fourth-quarter earnings of 10 cents to 12 cents a share.
In the 1992 fourth quarter, the footwear concern had net income of $947,000, or 13 cents a share, on seven million shares outstanding.
The company's 1993 results will be based on 9.3 million shares outstanding, reflecting an initial public offering last October.
For the year, Deckers Outdoor expects to report net income of about $6.2 million to $6.3 million, or 79 cents to 81 cents a share, Mr. Otto said.
Analysts had predicted earnings of 76 cents to 78 cents a share.
In 1992, the company had net income of $4.1 million, or 59 cents a share.
Sales for 1993 are expected to hit $57 million, up 60% from $35 million in 1992.
Mr. Otto said he is comfortable with analysts' predictions of $1.10 in per-share earnings for 1994, and of 15%-20% annual growth for the next five years.
"That's doable," he said.
"Our move toward product diversity is taking hold."
While the company's popular rubberand-nylon Teva sandal dominates sales, Mr. Otto said that is beginning to change.
Teva sales constituted "a little under 90%" of total sales for 1993, the executive said, down from 98% the previous year.
Deckers Outdoor expects Teva sales to make up about 50% of total sales within five years, with the remainder coming from new apparel and shoe lines and future acquisitions.
"We're shifting away from a one-product company, but we're not holding down Teva sales to do that," Mr. Otto said.
"We're still aggressively selling Teva, but we're looking for something else to sell aggressively as well that will counterbalance the seasonality of the sandal."
Deckers Outdoor recently showed two new outdoor shoes that will hit the market next fall.
The company, which has expanded its sales in the past primarily through high-end retailers and word of mouth, is stepping up advertising.
Its first television commercial for Teva sandals, which started running earlier this month, will air on cable channels such as MTV, ESPN and Discovery.
