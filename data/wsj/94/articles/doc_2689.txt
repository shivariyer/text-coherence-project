The Justice Department endorsed "the concept of more rapid disclosure of the contents of patent applications," but indicated more study is needed on how to achieve it.
In testimony before the Senate subcommittee on patents, copyrights and trademarks, Richard Gilbert, an assistant attorney general in the antitrust division, said the administration also supports making patent terms run 20 years from the date of application, rather than 17 years from the date a patent is granted.
Legislation sponsored by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) would require disclosure of patent applications after 18 months, even if no patent has been issued.
Currently, patent applications are secret until a patent is granted.
Mr. Gilbert said the department believes the issue needs further study to ensure balance between disclosing information that would encourage technological developments and protecting the intellectual property of inventors.
An aide to Mr. DeConcini said the disclosure provision would prevent inventors from purposely delaying completion of the application process.
Such delays effectively extend the patent protection term.
Because information about inventions remains secret during the application process, delays effectively deny competitors access to the technology.
In most cases, increasing patent terms three years, while making the terms begin earlier, would slightly increase the effective term of patents.
That's because it generally takes almost two years for pending patents to gain approval.
In the biotechnology area, however, approval can take much longer.
