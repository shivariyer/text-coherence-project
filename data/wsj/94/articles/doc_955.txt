WVS Financial Corp. said two shareholders filed a class-action lawsuit March 10 against it and its wholly owned subsidiary, West View Savings Bank, and certain officers and directors of the savings bank.
The lawsuit, filed by Jeffrey G. Carberry and Robert C. Bittner of Somerset, Pa., in Pittsburgh's U.S. District Court, alleges among other things that the company violated federal securities laws in connection with its Nov. 29, 1993, mutual-to-stock conversion of the savings bank, WVS said.
Among the 10 defendants named in the suit are chief executive officer Robert C. Sinewe and David J. Bursic, chief financial officer and treasurer.
The suit claims that the named officers and directors received a disproportionate share of the offering in relation to the depositors.
It also claims that the purchases by the defendants exceeded what they disclosed in the prospectus by about 72,000 shares and that not all of the shares were offered while about 115,200 shares were deregistered, even though there were numerous unfulfilled subscriptions.
WVS said it believed the suit was "without merit" and planned to contest it.
