Jane L. Warner, 47 years old, was named president of Textron Inc.'s Randall Textron division, effective immediately.
Textron is an aerospace, manufacturing and financial-services concern; Randall, in Cincinnati, makes automotive parts.
Ms. Warner, the first woman president of a Textron division, was assistant chief engineer and product manager of General Motors Corp.'s midsize car division, Camaro and Firebird Platform.
She succeeds Russell G. Downing, who left the company to "pursue other interests," the company said.
Mr. Downing's departure follows a recent recall by GM of 53,000 new S-10 pickup trucks that contained faulty fuel pipes that people familiar with the recall said were supplied by Randall Textron.
GM said the faulty parts didn't meet federal standards for fuel leakage in a collision.
Mr. Downing couldn't be reached for comment; Textron didn't return phone calls.
