PacTel Corp., the wireless-communications business that is being spun off from parent Pacific Telesis Group, reported a tripling of net income for 1993 due to high subscriber growth.
Net income rose to $34.5 million, or eight cents a share, up from $10.2 million, or two cents a share, in 1992.
The year-ago figure included a net gain of $50 million for accounting changes and the early retirement of debt; without the gain, PacTel would have reported a loss in 1992 of about $40 million.
Cellular subscribers in U.S. and overseas markets rose 55% to 1.2 million.
PacTel's revenue in 1993 moved up 18% to $988 million from $838.5 million in 1992.
For the quarter, PacTel, Walnut Creek, Calif., said it earned $14.6 million on $234.7 million of revenue.
The company did not give per-share or prior year comparisons.
