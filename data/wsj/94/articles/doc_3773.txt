The company named its president and chief operating officer, Philip G. Satre, as chief executive officer, suceeding Michael D. Rose.
Mr. Rose, 52 years old, will remain chairman and focus on Promus's casino development, the company's prime source of growth.
While the move was unexpected, analysts said it will better position Promus in the industry.
Mr. Satre, 44, has been with the company since 1980 and has served as president and chief operating officer since 1991.
Promus is the parent of Harrah's, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites.
