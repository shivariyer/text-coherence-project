Boeing Co.
Chairman Frank Shrontz and President Phil Condit have been granted stock options totaling nearly $8.4 million, exercisable if the company's stock price increases 53% from current levels.
According to a new incentive plan outlined in the company's proxy statement, the one-time supplemental stock-option grants were provided in part to add an incentive "during the significant market uncertainties and intense competition it faces in the near term."
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing closed at $46, down $1.
Boeing's share value has suffered for much of the last three years from weak airline orders for new planes.
But investors' hopes for a rebound have boosted the stock price nearly $6 a share in trading value since the $40.56-a-share base price for the options was established on Dec. 13, 1993.
Under the new incentive plan, which expires in late 1998, Mr. Shrontz would be able to exercise options valued at about $5,140,000, while Mr. Condit's options would be worth $3.2 million.
Mr. Shrontz could exercise half his total 200,000 options when the stock price hits $64 a share, for a value of $2,340,000.
The rest of his options become exercisable in 50,000-share increments when the stock price hits $67, and then $70.
A company spokesman said that the plan is justifiable, since shareholders would realize $8.16 billion in gains, above the base price, if the stock hits $64 a share.
