The federal Office of Thrift Supervision is seeking as much as $18.6 million in restitution and penalties from Donald Kaplan, a former director of American Savings of Florida, on charges involving a 1990 collateral-substitution plan.
Mr. Kaplan could also be banned from the banking industry.
In its enforcement action, the OTS charged him with illegally failing to tell the thrift's board and the OTS about the plan to substitute collateral "of uncertain value" for cash held as collateral.
The substituted collateral was stock in Enstar Retail, an affiliate of American Savings, which is based in Miami.
The Enstar stock had no real market value, the OTS said, and the collateral substitution caused the thrift to lose an estimated $23 million, the OTS said.
Enstar Group Inc. was the parent of Enstar Retail and owns 49% of American Savings.
The parent filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in May 1991 and was reorganized in June 1992.
Enstar Retail filed for bankruptcy protection in January 1991 and never emerged from the proceedings.
In 1992, a former American Savings chairman, who was also a former director of Enstar Group; a former Enstar Group chairman, who was also a former American Savings board member; and the thrift's former law firm paid a combined $11.2 million in restitution, settling OTS conflict-of-interest charges related to the collateral substitution.
Mr. Kaplan couldn't be reached for comment.
