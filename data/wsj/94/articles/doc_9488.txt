Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Cos., hoping for a stake in the hottest niche of the beverage business, has teamed up with Britain's Twining Crosfield & Co. to sell iced tea in the U.S.
Dr Pepper, the third-largest U.S. soft-drink vendor, said its Seven-Up USA unit and Twining formed a venture to develop and market the tea, expected to hit store shelves this spring under the Twining name.
Although Twining is a heavyweight in specialty teas in Europe -- it's the company behind the Earl Grey and Breakfast blends -- neither company has yet dabbled in ready-to-drink iced teas, prompting analysts to wonder whether the joint venture hasn't already missed the mark.
"This sounds like a dollar short to me," said William Leach, a beverage analyst at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York.
"It's a crowded market already."
Indeed, PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. -- Dr Pepper's biggest competitors in the soft-drink wars -- long ago picked sides on the iced-tea front.
Pepsi sells tea through a joint venture with Thomas J. Lipton Co., and Coke has joined with Nestle SA to sell the Nestea brand.
Lipton and Nestea rank second and third, respectively, behind market leader Snapple Beverage Corp. in a ready-to-drink tea market that analysts guess could grow 50% this year to about $1 billion in retail sales.
Jim Ball, a Dr Pepper spokesman, said the company believes the market is far from saturated.
"It's a very, very explosive segment of beverages."
A spokesman for London-based Twining, a unit of Associated British Foods PLC, couldn't be reached.
