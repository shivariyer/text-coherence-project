Panhandle Eastern Corp. said it will take a fourth-quarter $100 million pretax charge, which will be partly offset by a $48 million pretax gain.
Nevertheless, the Houston-based natural-gas pipeline company said earnings are expected to reflect "an improvement" from a year earlier.
The company said that despite the charge and the gain, it expects earnings to be in line with analysts expectations of about $49 million, or 37 cents a share.
Per-share figures reflect an increase in common shares outstanding to 119 million from 113 million a year before.
In 1992's fourth period, the company had net income of $43 million, or 40 cents a share, restated for an accounting change, on revenue of $697.3 million.
Panhandle said the charge is related to certain regulatory issues affecting its Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. subsidiary, which deregulated certain pipeline operations.
The gain is from the sale of certain pipeline assets to investors.
