Italian financial-enforcement authorities sequestered 120 billion lire ($71.0 million) in Ferruzzi group shares held by sisters Alessandra and Franca Ferruzzi, according to Italian newspaper reports.
The sequestration reportedly is related to the investigation of alleged Ferruzzi slush funds and involves shares in Serafino Ferruzzi SRL, Ferruzzi Serafino Italia SRL, Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA and Venini SpA.
Ferruzzi handed over operational control to a group of creditor banks last summer after sinking under 28 trillion lire of total losses for 1992.
