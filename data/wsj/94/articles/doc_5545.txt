Italian prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said the Italian banking system is financially solid.
The prime minister issued his defense of the banking sector in the aftermath of a report from Moody's Investors Service Inc. on Thursday, in which the ratings agency said it foresees significant stress on the credit ratings of Italian banks over the next few years.
Mr. Ciampi said Italy's banking system is capable of giving industry "a fundamental contribution for getting through the recession and launching economic recovery."
He also said the Italian banking industries' difficulties "are those connected to the crisis that has affected the entire European economy."
Italy's banking sector has been hit by problem loans, particularly to the troubled Ferruzzi SpA conglomerate.
But it also hasn't been immune to charges of corruption.
Most recently, several directors of Italian savings bank Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde, known as Cariplo, were charged with illegal use of Cariplo pension-fund money as well as with some irregularities concerning real-estate deals.
