Bay Meadows Operating Co. and California Jockey Club said they were having "exploratory" talks with other racetracks regarding possible combinations of operations.
They didn't disclose other participants in the talks, and said no terms had been discussed.
But Santa Anita Operating Co. disclosed Thursday that it was talking with the Northern California racetrack operators.
California Jockey Club is a real-estate investment trust whose shares trade as a single unit with those of Bay Meadows, which operates a racetrack near San Francisco.
