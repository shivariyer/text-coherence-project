Jan. 24, 1994
The economy saved a burst of growth for the final quarter of 1993, as it did for the last three months of 1992.
A flurry of consumer spending, home building and factory production all helped boost economic growth during last year's October-December period.
Many economists say the economy, as measured by gross domestic product, grew at an annual rate of 4% to 6% during the fourth quarter, up from 2.9% in the third quarter.
The growth surge brings back memories of 1992, when GDP accelerated to a 5.7% rate in the fourth quarter.
But unlike a year earlier, when the burst of growth quickly dropped to a 0.8% rate in the following quarter, economic strength is seen as being more firmly entrenched.
Gordon Richards, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said he expects a Commerce Department report this week will show that GDP grew at a 4.3% rate in the fourth quarter.
He forecasts 3.2% growth in the first quarter.
"Growth in the first quarter will drop off a little, but not like the magnitude of last year," Mr. Richards said.
He said GDP should grow 3% in 1994, compared with 2.8% in 1993.
As domestic consumption slows, exports should rise, helping to take up the slack, he said.
