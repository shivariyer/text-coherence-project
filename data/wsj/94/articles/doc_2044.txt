Brascan Ltd. said it will repay $62.5 million of a $500 million debenture issued in 1989 to settle a dispute with debenture holders.
In a court filing in Britain last year, the group of debenture holders, led by Chemical Banking Corp., alleged that Brascan had violated the terms of the debentures when it sold its 37% stake last year in John Labatt Ltd., a Toronto brewing concern.
The group claimed that the sale violated a clause in the agreement relating to the sale of "all, or a substantial part" of Brascan.
A court ruling against Brascan, a Toronto holding company at the center of the corporate empire controlled by Peter and Edward Bronfman, could have required the company to renegotiate the terms of the debentures or repay the issue in full.
The debentures pay a floating rate of interest and mature in 1999.
Aaron Regent, chief financial officer of Brascan, said the company also agreed to amend certain covenants in the debenture agreement, including a clarification of what "substantial" means.
He declined to be more specific.
The settlement ends all court proceedings, which were to have begun in June, Mr. Regent said.
Chemical Banking declined to comment.
