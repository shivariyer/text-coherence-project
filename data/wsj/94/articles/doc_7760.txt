An Italian parliamentary commission, in a 340-page report, said that illicit loans to Iraq from Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro were part of a wider policy to channel aid to Baghdad during its war with Iran, and that Rome and Washington must have known what was going on.
The commission investigated more than $4 billion in loans to Iraq made by BNL's Atlanta branch.
"That the political direction of the whole operation was always firmly based in Washington is evident," the report said.
"But that personalities in the Italian government and of BNL were aware of what was happening, or had received authoritative advice not to look too closely at the Atlanta branch operations, is more than a mere theory."
"It is now evident . . . that the affair constituted an American political scandal," the report added.
Before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the U.S. tilted toward Iraq as a counterweight to Iran, but the policy backfired with Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Last month, a U.S. court sentenced the manager of BNL's Altanta branch, Christopher Drogoul, to 37 months in prison for his role in granting the loans to Iraq during its 1980-88 war with Iran.
Mr. Drogoul managed the Atlanta office from 1984 until it was raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1991.
Most of the loans weren't authorized by senior BNL managers, and many illegally carried U.S. Export-Import Bank guarantees.
