I am responding to the March 1 editorial-page essay "Triumph of Textbook Trendiness," in which Gilbert T. Sewall commented on my recently published U.S. history textbook "Todd and Curti's The American Nation"
The world of high-school textbook publishing needs informed and thoughtful criticism, but Mr. Sewall's ideologically driven broadside is amazingly off-base.
Predictably invoking the trendy scare words ("dumbing down," "multiculturalism," "pressure groups"), he presents a grotesquely distorted caricature of a carefully planned, meticulously edited work.
This new edition of a highly esteemed and much-loved textbook preserves the strengths of the original while incorporating the best of recent scholarship and responding to the profound demographic, social and cultural changes that have transformed modern America (apparently while Mr. Sewall was otherwise engaged).
The primary documents, geographical emphasis, and imaginative study aids are all enormously useful.
The visually attractive format increases the odds that the book will actually be read.
The book emphasizes chronology and narrative, and offers solid political, diplomatic and military coverage.
"Todd and Curti's" was designed to present a clear and readable account of U.S. history from the earliest beginnings to the present, and it succeeds in that goal.
In collaboration with the superb and experienced editorial staff at Holt, Rinehart & Winston, I was intimately and continuously engaged in this project from the earliest drafts to a close reading of the final text.
The historians and teachers listed at the beginning all wrote careful and very helpful critiques of chapters.
I am honored to be associated with a classic textbook first written more than 40 years ago by my good friend and distinguished senior colleague Merle Curti.
