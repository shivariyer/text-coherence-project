CAE Inc., responding to a slowdown in orders from the U.S. military for simulation and training systems, said it will close its facility at Silver Spring, Md., by the end of the year.
CAE said the facility's product lines will be transferred to Binghamton, N.Y., headquarters of the company's CAE-Link military-simulation unit.
The closure will result in about 160 layoffs, and another 55 or so employees will be offered transfers to Binghamton, CAE said.
CAE-Link has 3,800 employees in total.
CAE, based in Toronto, said last week it had set aside from its earnings 33 million Canadian dollars (U.S.$24.6 million) to cover the costs of reducing CAE-Link's operations.
CAE said it plans to announce more cost-saving measures later.
The company also wrote down the value of CAELink by C$396.5 million, or 60%, to reflect reduced demand in the industry.
The Silver Spring site makes Trident submarine command and control trainers, antisubmarine-warfare trainers for patrol aircraft, and other training devices.
