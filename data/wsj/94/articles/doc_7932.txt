Fisons PLC unveiled plans to lay off up to 15% of the 6,400 employees at its pharmaceutical division.
Last month, the British company abruptly ousted Chief Executive Cedric Scroggs and announced restructuring steps that it said would wipe out projected full-year profit of #100 million ($149 million).
The brunt of last year's restructuring charge will be used to clean up a foundering scientific instruments unit.
With the instruments unit in order, management can turn its attention back to the pharmaceutical unit, which acounts for about one-third of sales but two-thirds of the company's annual pretax profit.
In connection with the latest austerity program, Chairman Patrick Egan said the company will take a #10 million one-time charge against this year's accounts and an additional #5 million charge in 1995.
Since becoming chairman in a hasty management shift in late 1991, Mr. Egan has been forced to tackle persistent problems-including complaints from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that prompted withdrawal of two Fisons drugs from the U.S. market.
