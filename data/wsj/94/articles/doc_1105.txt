Audi AG, the luxury car division of Germany's Volkswagen AG, said it will cut collective working hours and reduce pay scales by 10% beginning April 1 based on the most recent industry wage agreement.
"This agreement secures jobs by allowing us to offset current personnel over-supply and let us fashion the future of the company in a flexible way," said Andreas Schleef, management board member responsible for personnel.
