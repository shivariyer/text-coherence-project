Saudi Arabian businessman Sheik Mohammed Al-Amoudi emerged as the surprise winner of a 10-month bidding war for Sweden's biggest independent oil company, OK Petroleum AB.
Mr. Al-Amoudi agreed to pay 5.9 billion Swedish kronor ($749.3 million) for OK Petroleum's equity outstanding -- and will assume an additional 3.6 billion kronor of debt.
OK Petroleum went on the block last May -- and the Swedish government has touted sale of its 24% stake as a key item in a privatization program.
The hefty price fetched by OK Petroleum spurred speculation that covert financial backers may be supporting Mr. Al-Amoudi, who is described by an associate as a Jeddah-based businessman in his mid-40s with interests ranging from contracting and property to hotels and hospital administration.
Saudi Arabia has hunted around the world for refineries as a way to boost sales of its huge oil production in the form of refined products in retail markets and reduce the share of output sold as cheaper commodity crude.
Capacity at OK Petroleum's two refineries is 265,000 barrels a day, roughly 25% of total Scandinavian output.
OK Petroleum also plans to tighten relations with Saudi Aramco, the state oil giant.
"We'll look into the possibility of enlarging the short-term crude contract that OK has with Saudi Aramco and probably establish a long-term crude contract," said Mr. Ghazi Habib, an executive who will be Mr. Amoudi's representative on OK's board.
