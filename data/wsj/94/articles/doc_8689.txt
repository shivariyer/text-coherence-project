Yields on taxable money-market funds were generally down in the week ended Tuesday.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compound yield on taxable funds declined to 2.72% from 2.75%, according to Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass., newsletter.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
The seven-day simple yield on taxable funds eased to 2.69% from 2.71%, while the 30-day simple yield remained at 2.72%.
The 30-day compound yield slid to 2.75% from 2.76%.
Assets of 637 taxable funds (two more than the previous week) rose by $4.75 billion, to $493.93 billion, the newsletter said.
Institutional investors accounted for $2.84 billion of the inflow; individual investors put in $1.90 billion.
Walter Frank, chief economist for Money Fund Report, attributed the changes in yields and assets to seasonal adjustments.
"This should be the last week for these seasonal changes bringing things back to normal," Mr. Frank said.
Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments, which include commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and Treasury bills, remained at 59 days.
The average tax-exempt seven-day compound yield eased, to 1.68% from 1.74%, in the latest week.
The latest tax-free yield is equivalent to a taxable 2.63% for someone paying 36% in taxes and to 2.78% for those paying 39.6%.
Mr. Frank said that "the scarcity of new issues" was responsible for the decline in tax-exempt yields.
Assets of 340 tax-exempt funds (one more than last week) decreased by $332 million, to $111.68 billion, according to the newsletter.
The tax-free funds' average portfolio maturity remained at 58 days.
