Armstrong World Industries Inc., Lancaster, Pa., said it will take a fourth-quarter restructuring charge of $60 million, largely related to continued job cuts, resulting in a loss.
Armstrong said that excluding the restructuring charges of $1.59 a share would be between 80 cents and 85 cents a share, fully diluted.
That would far exceed the 13 cents a share in operating profit in the 1992 fourth quarter, and the 58 cents a share analysts expect for the quarter.
The news sent Armstrong's shares sharply higher, to close at $57.125, up $4, in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Armstrong said sales rose 4% from the $600.1 million of a year ago, and were a record for any fourth quarter.
Armstrong expects to post its results next week.
The maker and marketer of floor coverings and indoor furnishings said its future lower cost structure will have a continuing positive effect on earnings and cash flow beginning this year.
