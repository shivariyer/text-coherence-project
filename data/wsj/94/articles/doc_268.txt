Farragut Mortgage Co. said its lenders waived the company's technical default of its warehousing line of credit.
It also said it has been reinstated as a Federal National Mortgage Association mortgage servicer.
The cancellation of that status had caused the technical default.
Farragut Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen H. Dickmann, said, "We believe that with the banks' continued support we can concentrate on obtaining new financing.
If successful, this will allow us to complete our restructuring."
Farragut is a residential mortgage-banking company.
