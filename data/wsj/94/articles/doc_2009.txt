A ballot proposal to raise Michigan's sales tax to generate $10.2 billion for the state's public schools was leading in early returns last night.
The proposal was the only measure on the special statewide ballot.
If voters rejected it, a law passed by the legislature required the state income tax to be raised from to 6% from 4.6%.
With 10% of the precincts reporting, 172,184 people, or 72%, had voted in favor of the proposal, and 67,849 people, or 28%, against it.
The election marked the end of a saga that began last July, when lawmakers and Gov. John Engler ended the use of property taxes for school operations without having any replacement money in sight.
That wiped out about $7 billion, or 67%, of the money that had been used for educating Michigan's 1.6 million schoolchildren.
The sales tax increase was backed by Mr. Engler, a Republican who campaigned on a promise to cut property taxes.
