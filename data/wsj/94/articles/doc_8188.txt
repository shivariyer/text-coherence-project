Compaq Computer Corp. said it plans to expand its manufacturing operation in Scotland to help meet increasing demand for the personal-computer maker's products in Europe.
The $10.5 million expansion is scheduled to be completed in the third-quarter and will include the opening of two manufacturing lines for printed circuit boards.
