The Federal Communications Commission postponed a vote to revise the cable-television price regulations it adopted last year.
Instead of deciding the matter Thursday as planned, the agency tentatively set a vote for Feb. 22.
The delay gives the staff more time to complete a top-to-bottom review of the cable-pricing structure the agency adopted last April to comply with the 1992 Cable Act.
The rules, which went into effect in September, have generated a crush of complaints from consumers and communities that saw monthly cable bills rise rather than drop.
That effect wasn't envisioned by lawmakers who passed the 1992 law in reaction to consumer complaints about skyrocketing cable rates and poor service.
While last year's rules generally cut the prices cable companies charge for remote-control devices and other equipment, in many cases they let cable companies boost prices for programming services.
An FCC survey of 14 cable companies late last year found that about a third of the companies' subscribers had higher monthly bills after the rules went into effect.
