Anchor Bancorp Inc., Hewlett, N.Y., said it agreed to acquire Lincoln Savings Bank, a metropolitan New York savings institution, for $80 million.
Lincoln Savings, which has $2.1 billion of assets and $1.2 billion of loans, hasn't been in compliance with federal capital requirements, although the levels have improved, an official of the Office of Thrift Supervision said.
At Jan. 31, Lincoln had $143.5 million in nonperforming loans and real estate.
But Anchor said those assets appear "well controlled" and nonperforming balances have declined steadily.
Anchor had assets of $8.2 billion at the end of January.
On a pro-forma basis, Anchor, after acquiring Lincoln, expects to have about $10 billion in assets and $7 billion in deposits in 65 offices.
Anchor said the acquisition would put it among the 10 largest publicly held thrifts in the U.S.
James M. Large Jr., chairman and chief executive of Anchor, said the purchase will enhance Anchor's greater New York market and contribute to earnings within a year.
