PepsiCo Inc. began soft-drink production in Ho Chi Minh City Friday within hours of President Clinton's lifting of the trade embargo against Vietnam, while Coca-Cola Co. is busy preparing its formal entry into that country.
PepsiCo, the Purchase, N.Y., beverage company, produced 40,000 bottles for sampling purposes and plans to be fully operational in a week, a spokesman said.
The Pepsi-Cola International unit has signed a preliminary agreement with one of Vietnam's largest beverage companies to bottle soft drinks in that country.
Already prepared is Pepsi's first TV commercial aimed at the Vietnamese market, produced by Ogilvy & Mather.
A Coke official said production would begin as soon as concentrate and other necessary materials can be brought into the country.
Coke already enjoys wide distribution on the black market.
Atlanta-based Coke and Singapore soft-drinks company Fraser & Neave Ltd. formed a venture in March with Thai Pure Soft Drinks Ltd. in a move to tap the Indochinese market.
The venture will produce Coke and other soft drinks in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.
