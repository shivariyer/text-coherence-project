In regard to your March 15 editorial "Who Was Webster Hubbell? -- I": As a former member of the Bush/Quayle '92 national campaign staff, I have no special brief for the Clintons or their administration, but still I think you have unfairly disparaged Jaime Gorelick, current general counsel of the Defense Department and deputy attorney general-designate, by suggesting that she's not a first-string player.
Ms. Gorelik, former president of the D.C. bar, is far more than some hack criminal lawyer.
Her former firm is one of the premier appellate firms in the U.S.; she handled successfully many knotty civil matters as well as criminal, and she herself is a straight shooter, honest and candid.
If confirmed, she'll make a good deputy attorney general and will serve the president and the country well.
Give her a chance, will ya?
