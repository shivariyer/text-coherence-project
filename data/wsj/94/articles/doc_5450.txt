Western Co. of North America, Houston, said it expects to report that fourth-quarter operating profit fell 44%, largely as a result of the company having sold much of its offshore oil and gas drilling rigs during the last year.
Western Co., which said it's focusing more on its pressure-servicing business for oil and gas wells, said it expects operating profit of $4.5 million, or 24 cents a share.
In the year-earlier quarter, before a charge of $1.2 million from the prepayment of debt, the company reported profit of $8 million, or 45 cents a share, on revenue of $100.2 million.
Net income was $6.8 million, or 38 cents a share.
The oil-field-service company's estimate for the most recent fourth-quarter earnings excludes several expected nonrecurring items: a gain of $39.6 million from the sale of rigs; certain asset write-downs totaling $14 million; and a charge of $26.2 million related to the repurchase of senior notes.
