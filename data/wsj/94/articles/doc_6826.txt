L'Oreal SA was hit with a $100 million lawsuit in New York state Supreme Court, based on allegations that the French cosmetics concern complied unlawfully with the Arab League's boycott of Israel.
The suit was brought by two brothers, Jean and David Frydman, who were partners with L'Oreal in a film distribution company called Paravision International SA.
They say that, to mollify the Arab boycott committee, the French cosmetics group forced Jean Frydman from Paravision's board in 1989 because he is Jewish.
Their suit names L'Oreal and several affiliated companies and employees.
It alleges that L'Oreal committed a variety of crimes, including bribery, in complying with the boycott.
L'Oreal said that it hadn't analyzed the suit in detail, but that the filing "appears to repeat past allegations which are totally without merit."
The Frydmans first raised the charges in 1991.
Then as now, L'Oreal acknowledges having made commitments to the boycott office, although it insists that it merely promised to do things it was doing for business reasons anyhow.
It says it followed the advice of French officials and didn't break French law.
It says the Frydmans are simply trying to pressure L'Oreal to settle an old business dispute they have with the company.
After failing to win a settlement in France, the Frydmans are suing in New York, in part because U.S. anti-boycott law is stronger than French law.
The Frydmans also allege that efforts to wrong them were handled partly in the U.S., by a former Nazi collaborator, Jacques Correze, who once headed L'Oreal's U.S. distribution company, Cosmair Inc.
Mr. Correze died in 1991.
Cosmair said Mr. Correze was only the company's non-executive chairman, without any operating responsibilities, and that the lawsuit "clearly misstates the activities of Cosmair Inc."
