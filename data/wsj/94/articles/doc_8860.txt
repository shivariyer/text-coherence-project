WSFS Financial Corp. said its directors will seek shareholder approval to convert its expensive preferred stock to common stock.
The financial services concern said it plans to convert its 10% convertible preferred stock, Series 1, into 6.47 shares of common stock.
The preferred stock, issued in 1992, currently is convertible at any time and is callable on Jan. 1, 1996.
A 24.8% stake is held by Quad-C Inc., a Charlottesville, Va., venture-capital company, Chief Financial Officer William Abbott said.
Dividends on the preferred shares, normally payable beginning March 31, won't be paid as a result of the proposal, the company said.
WSFS said that under the terms of a recently completed private placement of $32 million of 11% senior notes due 2005, the annual interest rate on the notes will rise to 11.5% after June 30 if more than 50% of the preferred shares are outstanding.
The company said its annual interest costs could rise by $160,000 if the number of preferred shares isn't reduced.
The conversion requires a majority vote of both common and preferred stockholders, of which 43% are officers, directors and Quad-C, Mr. Abbott said.
As of Sept. 30, the company had 5.3 million shares of common stock outstanding and about 1.4 million shares of the preferred.
