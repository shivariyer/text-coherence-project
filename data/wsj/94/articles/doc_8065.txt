The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has upheld changes, on a one-year pilot basis, to the Nasdaq Stock Market's Small Order Execution System, set to go into effect today.
The Securities and Exchange Commission late last month approved a National Association of Securities Dealers proposal to reduce the maximum size of orders for SOES to 500 shares from an existing 1,000-share limit.
The rules also prohibit short sales on the system.
The SEC delayed implementing the rules until today from the planned effective date of Jan. 7 to prepare for the court action.
Several small brokerage firms that depend on SOES for much of their business had sought intervention from the court.
The firms have claimed they could be put out of business or forced to lay off employees because of the rules.
But Nasdaq market makers have said for years that these "SOES activist" firms abuse the system by sending repeated orders to market makers in rapid succession.
When stock prices change quickly, these professionals trade large amounts of stock before market makers can adjust the advertised prices at which they will buy or sell, costing the market makers thousands of dollars.
In the order today, the court said, "Petitioners have not demonstrated the requisite irreparable injury to warrant the relief sought."
