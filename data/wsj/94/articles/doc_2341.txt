SkyBox International Inc. said Howard M. Lorber was elected chairman, succeeding Bennett S. LeBow.
Mr. Lorber, 45 years old, was already a director of SkyBox, a sports and entertainment trading-card company.
He is president of Hallman & Lorber Associates Inc., a consulting and actuarial company, and chairman of Nathan's Famous Inc. and VTX Electronics Corp.
Separately, SkyBox said Ronald Kramer, 35, was elected a director, increasing the size of the board to six members.
Mr. Kramer, an investment banker, is a managing director of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.
Mr. LeBow, 56, who has served as SkyBox chairman since 1990, will remain a director.
He is chairman of Brooke Group Ltd., a Miami-based holding company that owns Liggett Group, the tobacco concern.
A SkyBox spokesman said the move by Mr. LeBow "represents a step toward withdrawing from the company."
Indeed, SkyBox also said it planned to redeem the balance of its Series A voting cumulative preferred stock, all of which is currently held by Brooke Group and its subsidiaries.
The spokesman for SkyBox said Brooke Group holds 34.6% of the company's total voting rights through the Series A preferred shares.
He added that Brooke Group holds 13.3% of SkyBox voting rights on the common shares.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading on Friday, SkyBox shares closed at $10.375, up 25 cents.
