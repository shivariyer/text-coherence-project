QVC Network Inc. shares fell yesterday as the company tried to rally support from shareholders of Paramount Communications Inc., which continues to favor rival bidder Viacom Inc.
The Paramount board, meanwhile, is expected to endorse Viacom's latest offer at a meeting later today.
Paramount shareholders have until Feb. 14 to decide which bid to accept, and the bidder that gets 50.1% of the shares at that point wins the contest.
The winner must then keep its offer open another two weeks to accept other shares.
QVC stock fell 87.5 cents to $45.875 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and Viacom Class B shares rose 50 cents to $34 on the American Stock Exchange.
Shares of Paramount rose 12.5 cents to $78.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Because QVC's cash-and-stock bid contains roughly $3.4 billion of QVC stock, Chief Executive Barry Diller and his advisers hope to boost the demand for QVC stock among institutional investors.
Their object is to persuade takeover-stock traders that QVC shares wouldn't decline as much as they think if QVC succeeds in acquiring Paramount.
QVC plans to promote Mr. Diller as a manager of entertainment assets and to attack Viacom's alleged weaknesses, such as new competition it faces for its MTV music-video cable network.
Viacom officials say they aren't worried about competitive threats.
