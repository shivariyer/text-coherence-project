Weirton Steel Corp. said its bargaining units represented by the Independent Steelworkers Union ratified a labor agreement with the steelmaker.
The Weirton, W.Va., company said the three-year pact provides bonuses of $1,000 per employee for the first year and $1,250 for each of the following two years.
The pact covers about 5,000 Weirton Steel employees, a company spokesman said.
The agreement also provides workers with a managed-health care plan and includes a provision that "protects a certain minimum amount of workers from layoffs" under certain conditions.
The company declined to disclose what those conditions are at this time.
Weirton Steel operates an integrated flat-rolled steel products plant.
