Falcon Oil & Gas Co. said it plans to review various financing and restructuring strategies, including the possible sale of the company, to "enhance shareholder value."
Falcon said that although it hasn't hired an outside counselor to examine such possibilities, the Houston company needs additional capital to meet the $35 million in expected costs to develop wells in Richland County, Mont.
"We estimate the possible and probable reserves there at 11 million barrels of oil," said Spencer Murchison, president and chief executive officer.
For the fiscal nine months ended Oct. 31, Falcon had a net loss of $59,236, or three cents a share, on revenue of $2.3 million.
