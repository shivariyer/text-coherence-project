Tyson Foods Inc. chose Pine Bluff, Ark., as one of four sites for a big expansion of the company's poultry production capacity.
Tyson, the nation's largest poultry company, said it picked Pine Bluff because the company already has a plant there that does additional processing on chickens that have been slaughtered.
The company said the $30 million to $40 million expansion in Pine Bluff, including a slaughter facility and new chicken-growing houses, will allow Tyson to kill an additional 1.3 million birds a week.
The dead birds and chicken parts that are now sent to Pine Bluff will be processed at other Tyson facilities, a spokesman said.
Tyson said the expansion in Pine Bluff, in southeastern Arkansas, will create 300 to 400 jobs.
The company said the area doesn't have the type of labor shortage that ruled out northwestern Arkansas, Tyson's base, as an expansion site.
Tyson has its headquarters in Springdale, Ark.
