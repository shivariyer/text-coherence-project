Frederick Klein complains that his Chicago Bulls tickets won't be nearly as good in the team's new arena: he's being displaced by the "so-called luxury boxes" (Leisure & Arts, March 4).
Because those boxes are "subsidized by the tax write-offs afforded to business entertainment," he says, they "command prices far in excess of what can be charged for ordinary tickets to sporting events."
I understand his anger; however, the Internal Revenue Code {Section 274 (1)(2)} limits the deduction associated with such luxury boxes to the "face value of non-luxury box seat tickets for the seats in such box."
