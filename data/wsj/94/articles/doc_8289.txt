Castle Energy Corp., Radnor, Pa., said a shareholder filed a suit alleging that the company violated federal security laws in connection with its recent public offering.
The suit, filed by Leslie Susser in the federal court in California, claimed Castle Energy failed to disclose certain information regarding the financial condition of its principal customer, Metallgesellschaft AG.
The suit also calls for a temporary restraining order that would freeze proceeds from the oil and gas concern's offering.
Castle Energy said it believes "all material allegations against it . . . are groundless."
Metallgesellschaft, a troubled metals and trading company that owns 40% of Castle Energy, recently announced restructuring to solve certain financial problems and satisfy creditors.
Castle Energy said certain current and former officers and directors, as well as Metallgesellschaft, were named in the California suit.
Castle Energy also said it believed a similar suit was also filed in federal court in Pennsylvania.
