Your recent story on trial lawyers ("Slick Tactics: Trial Lawyers Glide Past Critics With Aid of Potent Trade Group," Feb. 17) blatantly overlooked the compelling health and safety issues and constitutional arguments that the majority of trial lawyers grapple with each day -- on behalf of their clients and, ultimately, all of us.
Millions of Americans are injured each year due to others' negligence.
Do they not deserve some semblance of justice?
And shouldn't they receive the strongest backing possible when they face off with powerful, well-represented conglomerates whose bottom-line is simply to maximize profits.
Before nitpicking the trial bar, you might check with those Americans who have been tragically and negligently injured.

You seem to have reserved use of the term "trial lawyer" to refer exclusively to lawyers who represent personal-injury claimants.
If not by design, you appear to have swallowed at least part of the bait that the Association of Trial Lawyers of America so expertly trolls: the notion that ATLA's members and other personal-injury lawyers are the only true "trial lawyers."
This does a disservice to lawyers on the other side: those trial lawyers who represent defendants against the well-oiled ATLA juggernaut, much of the work of which might well be taxpayer-subsidized, cloaked as it is in the framework of purportedly "consumer-oriented" and often tax-exempt organizations.
You would do well to provide minimal recognition that defense lawyers are, in every sense, trial lawyers, too.
Indeed, it is more than plausible to suggest that, given the plaintiff bar's hypersuccessful record of stacking the deck of our legal system against targeted defendants and industries, it is in no small measure due to the accomplishments of defense trial lawyers that the transfers of wealth so unabashedly a part of the personal injury bar's agenda are not even more remarkable.
