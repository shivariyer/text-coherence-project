Thomas J. Lee Co., a Boston investment firm that holds a 47.5% stake in Snapple Beverage Corp., said it signed a nonbinding letter of intent to acquire a closely held bottler and distributor for about $32 million.
Majority holders of KBG Holdings Inc., the parent of Kemmerer Bottling Group Inc., Darien, Ill., signed the nonbinding letter to sell their equity interest to Thomas H. Lee.
As part of the proposed transaction, Snapple would acquire a 20% stake in KBG Holdings.
Kemmerer is an independent regional bottler and distributor of carbonated and other beverages in the Midwest with annual sales of more than $200 million.
Snapple, which makes a wide range of mostly bottled beverages, has been a high-flying stock since the Valley Stream, N.Y., company went public in December 1992.
The proposed transaction is subject to a definitive agreement, shareholder approval and regulatory clearance.
