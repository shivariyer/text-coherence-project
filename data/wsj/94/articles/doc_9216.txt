Almost a year after Manila's two stock exchanges agreed to merge, the government-brokered marriage is finally nearing consummation.
Exchange officials say they hope to link the two trading floors by computer this month, creating a single-price market that will likely drive already-soaring trading volumes even higher.
Eduardo de los Angeles, president of the unified Philippine Stock Exchange, said trial runs will continue next week and that he was hopeful of meeting the January deadline for linking the Manila and Makati bourses.
A technician's error and an "internal system error" had scuttled tests over the past few days, he said at a news conference to announce a series of ambitious plans for the merged exchange.
Among the projects planned are a computerized clearing house and depository system, which would lead eventually to paperless trading; tougher listing requirements and rules to promote fairer allocation of new issues; the introduction of options and bond trading; and the establishment of a fund to reimburse investors when brokers go bust.
So far, unification has been slow going.
Although technically part of a single exchange since last March, the Manila and Makati floors have continued to trade independently.
The same stocks are listed on both exchanges, but prices occasionally vary between the two.
Bickering between the two bourses over issues such as the site of a unified exchange and its bylaws has hampered the coupling, although brokers say the infighting appears to have simmered down lately due to pressure from the government.
The delayed union didn't deter investors last year.
A flood of foreign funds, coupled with a general optimism about Philippine economic recovery this year, pushed the Manila composite index up 154% in 1993 -- the best performance in Asia -- while average trading volume jumped threefold to one billion Philippine pesos ($36.8 million) a day at each floor.
