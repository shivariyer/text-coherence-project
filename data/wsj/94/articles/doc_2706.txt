VSE Corp. said a U.S. Navy logistics support contract recently awarded to the company has been protested by two losing bidders.
The contract, awarded in late February, could generate revenue of about $77 million over the next five years for VSE's Value Systems Services division, the Alexandria, Va., engineering and management services company said.
The protests were filed with the General Accounting Office by two losing bidders: JWK International Corp. and Information Spectrum Inc., both of northern Virginia.
Robert Wojtal, legal counsel for Information Spectrum, said his company believes its bid wasn't correctly valued, and "our price was significantly lower" than VSE's.
The company won't begin work on the contract until the GAO rules on the protests, said Craig Weber, VSE chief financial officer.
