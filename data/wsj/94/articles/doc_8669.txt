The White House contacted former New Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman yesterday to gauge his interest in becoming defense secretary, an administration official said.
It isn't clear whether Mr. Rudman, a Republican, is interested in the job.
He couldn't be reached for a comment last night.
Separately, other administration aides said the White House "sounded out" Sen. Sam Nunn recently about whether he was interested in taking the Pentagon post.
After Bobby Inman told the White House on Jan. 6 that he wanted to withdraw his name from consideration for the defense post, one aide said, Vice President Al Gore began the process of looking for a new nominee.
As part of that process, Mr. Gore talked to Sen. Nunn, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
But the Georgia Democrat expressed no interest in the job, the aide said.
Aides to Sen. Nunn declined to comment.
