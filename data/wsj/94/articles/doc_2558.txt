Swiss-Swedish engineering and heavy-machinery group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG said that group net income fell 87% to $68 million in 1993 after a one-time restructuring charge of $596 million, while pretax profit after financial items rose 7.2% to $1.19 billion.
Asea Brown, based in Zurich, is jointly owned by Asea AB of Sweden and BBC Brown Boveri AG of Switzerland.
Operating profit jumped 20% to $2.18 billion last year from $1.81 billion in 1992.
In 1993, revenue declined 4.4% to $28.32 billion from $29.62 billion in 1992.
In its forecast, Asea Brown said a gradual improvement in demand for industrial products in Europe and North America is expected in 1994.
However, since Asea Brown's "investment-goods business typically lags in the economic cycle, the full impact of economic recovery will not be felt before 1995," it said.
