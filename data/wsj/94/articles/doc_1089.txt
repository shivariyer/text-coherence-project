Generic drug maker Barr Laboratories Inc. said it reintroduced 25 milligram capsules of its generic equivalent of Roche Holding AG's tranquilizer Librium, following additional studies to satisfy the Federal Drug Administration's validation requirement.
Barr said it expects total sales of the drug, including its 5 mg and 10 mg strengths, to run at about $3 million a year.
