Cadillac Fairview Inc. said it reduced its interest payments to holders of mortgages on the company's most troubled office buildings and shopping malls in Canada.
But the real-estate concern, which is closely held by a group of mainly U.S. pension funds, said it is making progress in negotiations with its banks and shareholders to solve its cash problems.
Cadillac said last week that it had begun negotiating to restructure some one billion Canadian dollars (US$740 million) of bank debt.
But Cadillac also has an additional C$2.2 billion of debt, which is directly secured by its various commercial properties.
Some of these holdings now aren't generating enough cash flow to cover the interest payments due on the mortgages, the company said.
A Cadillac spokesman said six of the company's 62 office buildings and malls in Canada are "under water," and another 10 or 12 Canadian properties are barely meeting their interest payments.
As a result, the company has begun servicing the debt on specific properties only to the extent that there is cash flow available from those properties.
"Landlords know they're not going to receive their full interest," the spokesman said.
Cadillac said it is making full mortgage payments on its 12 commercial properties in the U.S.
The Cadillac spokesman said that obtaining financing to maintain the company's operations, including paying the mortgages on its properties, is the "first step" of the planned restructuring.
As part of the restructuring package, the terms of which haven't been disclosed, Cadillac said it is considering raising new equity, selling nonstrategic assets and offering shares to the public.
