Hollywood Casino Corp. said it secured a three-year option on a 27.5-acre site in Virginia, should the state legalize riverboat gambling.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Hollywood said Virginia currently has no gaming legislation, and the Virginia General Assembly hasn't set a timetable for a voter referendum.
