An investment group led by New York money manager Michael Steinhardt sweetened its offer to buy America West Airlines, escalating the bidding war between it and a group that includes Continental Airlines.
Mr. Steinhardt's revised bid for America West, which has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection for 2 1/2 years, increases the value of the offer to $220 million from $200 million.
That bid equals the value of the offer from the investment group led by David Bonderman and James Coulter, Fort Worth, Texas, investors who are major shareholders in Continental.
Continental is also a partner in the Bonderman-led bid.
By revising his offer, Mr. Steinhardt, who leads a group called AWA Investor Group, is seeking to apply pressure to America West's board, which favors the Bonderman-led bid.
The revised bid could also become part of the battle for the company in bankruptcy-law court.
That's because the unsecured creditor committee supports Mr. Steinhardt.
Under terms of the new proposal, Mr. Steinhardt's group would purchase 33.5% of the Phoenix airline's common stock for $11.57 a share, or $155 million.
It would purchase the carrier's debt securities for $65 million, and obtain warrants to buy an additional 9% of the fully diluted common stock at $15 a share.
Mr. Steinhardt would also offer current equity holders 4% of the new common stock.
A spokesman for Mr. Bonderman said he hadn't seen the revised bid, but said Mr. Bonderman's proposed alliance between Continental and America West, including joint frequent-flier programs and marketing efforts, gives the Bonderman-led bid the upper hand.
America West Chairman William A. Franke said he couldn't comment on the revised bid until he had a chance to read it.
