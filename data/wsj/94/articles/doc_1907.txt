In response to Albert R. Hunt's Feb. 10 Politics & People column "The Balanced-Budget Hoax": We often refer to "the" federal budget/debt as if it belonged to someone else.
It is "ours."
Mr. Hunt appears to advocate continuing "our" U.S. fiscal slow suicide.
Interest on our debt now consumes about 15% of our budget and is climbing.
If we do not control our debts now, when will we?
Shall we wait until the interest consumes 20%, 25%, 30% or more of our budget?
Clearly, at those marks, it is infinitely more difficult to balance our budget by traditional methods.
A possible alternative to balancing these budgets is to substantially inflate our currency and thus effectively reduce the volume of our debt and entitlements.
That would not be a sound strategic choice.
As time passes, our goal is ever-more elusive, in part due to the accumulation of debt from prior years.
In the heartland many of us will be watching the balanced budget amendment vote and its (presumed) implementation with great interest.
All of us may be able to experience the effects of balancing the budget today.
However, some of us, as well as our children, are also young enough to be able to experience the effects resulting from inaction on this crucial matter.
I, for one, believe that our country's future is dependent on stable fiscal footings.
