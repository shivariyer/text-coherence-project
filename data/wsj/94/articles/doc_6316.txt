Lukens Inc., Coatesville, Pa., said it reached a definitive agreement to sell the assets of its Materials Handling Group as part of its plans to concentrate on its core steel business.
Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.
The group's assets will be sold to Powerscreen International PLC of Dungannon, Northern Ireland.
Lukens Materials Handling Group consists of Simplicity Engineering Inc. and Ludlow-Saylor Inc.
The two units had combined 1993 sales of about $25 million and are profitable, Lukens said.
Simplicity makes products used for processing and conveying bulk materials, such as crushed stone, sand and gravel.
Ludlow-Saylor makes heavy-gauge woven wire and cast polyurethane screens used mainly to classify bulk materials.
