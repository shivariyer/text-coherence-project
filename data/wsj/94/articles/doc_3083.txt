The Kuwait Investment Office's Spanish holding company reportedly paid about $300 million to foreign politicians between 1990 and 1992 in an effort to win their support for Kuwait during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
Spain's leading daily, El Pais, said it had obtained a report written by a former executive of Grupo Torras SA for Kuwait's state prosecutor, which suggests that the political commissions contributed to the company's collapse in 1992.
The Kuwaiti state prosecutor is investigating the KIO's claims that it lost $5 billion invested in Spain between 1986 and 1992.
The KIO alleges the money was mismanaged by former Torras executives.
But El Pais said the document was written to discourage further investigation of alleged payments to foreign politicians, including Spaniards.
Because Spain didn't freeze Kuwait's foreign assets after the 1990 Iraqi invasion, Torras became a clearing house for many KIO financial operations.
According to El Pais, the document indicates that former Torras deputy Chairman Javier de la Rosa and his financial director allegedly oversaw payments to foreign politicians.
Many of these operations were carried out through banks in Switzerland, it said.
Officials at KIO and Torras weren't available to comment.
