Sun Sportswear Inc., Kent, Wash., said it expects to report 1993 earnings were $2.5 million to $2.9 million, implying fourth-quarter earnings of $100,000 to $400,000.
The clothing concern estimated 1993 sales of $107 million to $108 million, implying fourth-quarter sales of $28.4 million to $25.4 million.
In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Sun earned $119,000, or two cents a share, on $20.4 million in sales.
In a statement, the casual sportswear maker said 46% of last year's sales came from products bearing licensed designs, including Looney Tunes characters.
Sun added that it hopes to fatten profit margins and lower costs through recent investments in new technology, including a computer-aided design system for art production.
