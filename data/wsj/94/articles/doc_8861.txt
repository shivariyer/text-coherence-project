Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. said it will accelerate previously announced plans to reduce its work force and streamline operations.
The Syracuse, N.Y., electric and gas utility said it will lay off about 900 employees, including 250 management positions, during the next several months.
The company said the layoffs were part of an overall effort to reduce costs.
Previously, Niagara Mohawk planned to eliminate 1,400 positions by the end of 1995.
At the end of 1993, it had cut 646 jobs, including 203 management positions, under the program.
Currently, the company has about 11,250 employees.
Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange trading, Niagara Mohawk stock closed at $19.375, off 12.5 cents, just above its 52-week low of $19.125.
The announcement of accelerated work-force reductions came after the market closed.
