H.J. Heinz Co., citing a slowdown in its Weight Watchers unit as well as a higher tax rate, reported a 21% drop in profit for its fiscal third quarter.
Heinz had net income of $128.6 million, or 50 cents a share, for the quarter ended Jan. 26, compared with net of $162.3 million, or 62 cents a share, a year ago.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations, though some reduced their estimates going forward.
"I've lowered my numbers three times in 1994 and lowered them again today," said Michael Mauboussin, an analyst with CS First Boston.
The Pittsburgh food company said its tax rate in the quarter was 40.3%, compared with 34.4% a year ago.
A spokesman said the decline in the tax rate resulted from "a change in the mix of business for the quarter."
Weight Watchers diet classes and frozen foods were hurt by winter weather, the Los Angeles earthquake and "fluctuating diet patterns, primarily in the U.S.," the company said.
Marketing expenditures rose 19% during the quarter.
Sales fell 3.2% to $1.71 billion, reflecting several asset sales in 1993 as well as adverse foreign-currency translations.
Separately, members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 325, citing differences on proposed wage increases, rejected a proposed five-year contract by a vote of 712 to 34.
The members work at a Heinz plant in Pittsburgh which employs more than 750.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading, Heinz shares were quoted at $30.875, down 62.5 cents.
