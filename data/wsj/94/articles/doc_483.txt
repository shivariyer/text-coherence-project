Federal Paper Board Co., Montvale, N.J., said it will report lower-than-expected results for the fiscal first quarter ended Sunday.
But the balance of the year "looks far more favorable," the company added.
For the year-earlier period, the company posted net income of $9.1 million, or 18 cents a share, on sales of $319.8 million.
Thomas L. Cox, vice president and treasurer, said many analysts had expected earnings of about 20 cents a share for the latest first quarter.
Richard Palm, a Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst, said he had projected 22 cents a share.
The company said first-quarter results were adversely affected by poor weather, weakness in parts of the bleached-paperboard market and operating problems that resulted in lost production and higher costs in some facilities.
Nonetheless, John R. Kennedy, president, said, "The pulp market is enjoying increased demand and improved pricing" with a recent price increase expected to be realized beginning with shipments in early April.
