The Clinton administration, as part of a revamped immigration strategy, plans to increase enforcement against employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers.
Attorney General Janet Reno plans to announce several steps to correct immigration-related problems, including a reorganization of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, at a news conference with INS Commissioner Doris Meissner today .
Increased enforcement, which includes hiring and redeploying hundreds of Border Patrol agents over two years, is one of four initiatives designed to improve the INS, an agency that has acquired a reputation as an administrative basket case.
Under the new immigration strategy, INS agents will step up enforcement against employers who have shown a "pattern and practice" of employing undocumented workers, according to a congressional aide who was briefed on the program.
Employers must check certain documents of job applicants in an attempt to ascertain that they aren't in the country illegally before hiring them.
In addition to enforcement and reorganization, the initiatives include reducing the enormous backlog of applications for political asylum by hiring additional asylum officers, and cutting the time it takes to process naturalization applications by hiring additional staff.
In a message sent to INS employees Monday, Ms. Meissner said that "the reorganization plan responds to the widely held view -- within INS and by our stakeholders -- that the agency is not working well as presently structured."
The statement didn't specify cost or personnel figures.
