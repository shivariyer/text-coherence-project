Europa Cruises Corp. said it plans to spin off its Casino World Inc. subsidiary to Europa Cruises shareholders.
Separately, the cruise operator said it expects to report a "substantial" operating loss for 1993 from its core day-cruise business.
Europa Cruises failed in an earlier attempt to spin off the casino subsidiary.
The company said its plans were delayed by its recent battle with Charles Liberis, its former chairman.
Mr. Liberis unsuccessfully attempted to oust Europa's board last fall.
Once the spinoff is completed, Casino World plans to sell three million shares of convertible preferred stock at $5 a share, according to Europa Cruises.
Proceeds will be used to develop the company's dockside gaming properties in Mississippi.
Europa Cruises, which runs day and evening cruises on three Florida-based ships, said its expected operating loss for 1993 stems largely from the unprofitable operation of a cruise boat it had been chartering, a spokesman said.
For 1992, Europa Cruises reported a loss of $1.2 million, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $14.3 million.
Europa Cruises said it terminated the charter agreement in December.
Charles H. Reddien, Europa Cruises' chairman and chief executive officer, said passenger volume reached a record in February, with 30,000 passengers boarding Europa boats that month.
