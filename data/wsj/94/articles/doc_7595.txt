Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said he plans to begin soon a pilot program for meat inspection using more-scientific "rapid testing" of carcasses that could replace the usual visual inspection process.
Mr. Espy also said the department has begun unannounced visits to 1,000 of its 7,000 meat and poultry plants, to see whether their inspection efforts need improving.
Similar surprise reviews were made at 90 meat plants last spring and at 26 turkey-processing facilities in late 1993.
The secretary's remarks, before a food-safety seminar in New York, were made a year after hamburger tainted by the bacteria E.coli killed three children in Washington state.
Mr. Espy was recently briefed by Agriculture Department scientists on the rapid-detection test for E.coli and other food-borne pathogens, as well as sprays that could be used to reduce bacteria on carcasses in meat-processing plants, aides said.
The pilot program will involve swabbing samples of meat moving down production lines and judging whether unseen pathogens are present, a department spokeswoman said.
