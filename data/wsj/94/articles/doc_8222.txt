CBS Inc. sports commentator John Madden will join News Corp.'s Fox network, giving the previously sportsless Fox instant credibility when it takes over National Football League broadcasts in the fall.
Mr. Madden's salary is $30 million over four years, according to an executive familiar with the situation.
In addition, Fox is expected to announce today that KARD-TV in Monroe, La., will become a Fox affiliate on April 17.
The station is currently an affiliate of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC network.
Fox said when it acquired the NFL rights that it hoped to use them to lure affiliates.
Fox lacks affiliates in about 50 cities.
In December, Fox outbid CBS for the NFL package, paying $1.58 billion over four years for the NFL's National Football Conference games.
CBS had broadcast pro football for 38 years.
Another CBS football commentator, Pat Summerall, will join Mr. Madden at Fox.
Fox and CBS declined to comment.
