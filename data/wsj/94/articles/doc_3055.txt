The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported net income for 1993 fell 25%, primarily a result of higher amortization costs and costs related to the World Trade Center bombing.
Richard C. Leone, chairman of the bistate agency, said its financial performance was "remarkable" in view of the impact of the bombing last February.
The Port Authority's capital program of more than $700 million included $114 million in blast-related repair costs.
Trade center occupancy rose to 90% last year from 88% at the end of 1992.
Mr. Leone said 1993 saw a rebound in the region's economy, with increases in passenger traffic at the area's three major airports, as well as increases in cargo volumes at the airports and through the agency's port terminals.
"The fundamental operating results of Port Authority facilities was largely unchanged," said Ray Mannion, comptroller.
Operating revenue in 1993 was $1.92 billion, a $13 million decline from the previous year's $1.93 billion.
Operating expenses also fell, to $1.34 billion from $1.35 billion, an $8 million decline.
Net income in 1993 declined to $107.6 million from $144.4 million a year earlier.
In addition to a $34 million increase in depreciation expenses and $33 million in costs net of insurance related to the bombing, revenue from bridges and tunnels was lower than the previous year because of inclement weather.
Income from the agency's investment portfolio declined about $10 million.
The 1992 results included a gain of about $21 million from the sale of a facility, Mr. Mannion said.
Stanley Brezenoff, executive director, said the agency's ability to contain costs and keep spending flat over a two-year period "is clear evidence" that the productivity and cost-saving measures implemented by the agency in the past few years are paying off.
