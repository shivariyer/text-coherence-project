The U.K. Court of Appeal has significantly reduced the damages awarded to Smith New Court PLC for losses related to its 1992 purchase of shares in Ferranti International Signal PLC from Citibank.
Smith New Court was originally awarded 10.8 million ($15.9 million).
After an appeal by Citibank, however, the award has been reduced to just under 1.2 million, plus interest.
Smith New Court said that despite reducing the award the Court of Appeal upheld its original ruling that the brokerage was misled into paying 23 million for a block of Ferranti shares in July 1989 by false claims by Citibank that it was in competition with two other bidders.
The original judgment was given against Citibank NA, a unit of Citicorp, and its former head of private banking, Christopher Roberts.
The U.K. brokerage said it was "naturally disappointed" by the ruling and will seek to appeal the decision to the House of Lords.
Smith New Court said the original award has been held as part of its cash balances, but that no credit has been taken to its profit and loss account.
Citibank said it has no comment on the court's judgment.
