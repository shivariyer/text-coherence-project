Nova Corp. of Alberta said it plans to spend nearly 500 million Canadian dollars ($368 million) over the next 12 months on further natural gas-services acquisitions.
A spokesman for the Calgary pipeline and petrochemicals company said Nova has earmarked C$250 million raised from a recent C$500 million common-share issue as a "war chest" for its proposed spending spree, and expects to have this money "fully deployed" within 12 months.
He said the company plans to match the equity component of any acquisitions with an equal amount of bank financing.
Nova started its expansion into the fast-growing natural gas-marketing and gas-services business in January, when it acquired 36.5% of closely held Houston gas trader Natural Gas Clearinghouse.
Earlier this month, it acquired Ontario gas marketer Great West Energy Ltd.
Yesterday it agreed to purchase the 50% of Calgary gas marketer Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. that it doesn't already own from Calgary resources company Alberta Energy Co.
Nova also said its board approved a plan to establish four operating subsidiaries of a new public company to be called Nova Corp.
The units will be a pipeline company, a petrochemicals company and two companies to conduct Nova's natural gas-services business, respectively within and outside North America.
If the reorganization is approved, the parent company's common shares will become common shares in the new Nova Corp.
Nova said it will ask shareholders to approve the plan at its May 6 annual meeting.
Nova said it will also seek approval for a shareholder-rights plan for the proposed new holding company.
Under the plan, any offer to acquire control must be for all voting shares and made to all shareholders.
Holders must be given at least 90 days to consider an offer to purchase their shares.
