This is in response to the following statement in Lindley H. Clark's Speaking of Business ("Balanced Budget Post Mortem," editorial page, March 9): "The biggest problem was and is entitlement programs.
The public has been sold on the idea that the government must help everybody, whether they need it or not.
The prime examples are Social Security and Medicare."
I would like to remind Mr. Clark that Social Security payments are not "the government helping everybody" -- Social Security is not an entitlement program, but a savings system.
When the government sends a Social Security check to an individual, it is not giving him anything; it is paying him back a portion of the money he has saved for his retirement through a special government plan.
The money belongs to the individual, money owed to him, money systematically and forcibly taken from his paycheck as security against a time when he will be too old to work.
