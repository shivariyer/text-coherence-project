WRT Energy Corp. said it completed a $16.5 million acquisition of proved reserves and oil field equipment in Louisiana.
The oil and natural gas company had announced earlier this month that it would swap 1.7 million shares of its common stock valued at about $18.6 million for working interests in the Cameron Parish, La., properties.
Instead, the company paid Texas American Resources Inc. and Buckingham Capital Corp. $11.5 million in cash and 454,000 shares of restricted common stock valued at $5 million for a 100% working interest in 3,500 acres of oil and gas leases and for two drilling rigs and associated equipment valued at $2.5 million.
A company spokesman said the acquisition increased the company's proved oil reserves 293% to 5.5 million barrels of oil from 1.4 million barrels of oil and increased its gas reserves 40% to 13.6 billion cubic feet from 9.7 billion cubic feet.
