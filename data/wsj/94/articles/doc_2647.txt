New Plan Realty Trust said that it expects acquisitions of shopping centers and retail properties to boost fiscal second-quarter earnings about 22%, and that it plans to tap the public debt market to raise at least $100 million for additional acquisitions.
William Newman, chairman and chief executive of the New York-based real estate investment trust, one of the nation's largest, said net income for the quarter that ended Jan. 31 would be about $12.9 million, or 26 cents a share, up from $10.6 million, or 22 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Funds from operations, considered by analysts a more accurate measure of profitability, will rise 27% to about $15.2 million, or 31 cents a share, from $12 million, or 25 cents a share, a year ago.
The measure is income before depreciation and deferred taxes.
"We expect income in the third and fourth (fiscal quarter) to be better than the preceding two quarters as more properties come on line," said Mr. Newman.
New Plan, which currently pays quarterly dividends of 33 cents, usually raises the amount about one cent a year and expects that pattern to continue.
