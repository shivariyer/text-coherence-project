Starter Corp. said a shareholder filed a class-action lawsuit against the company and its chairman and chief executive officer alleging that they failed to disclose promptly adverse facts about fourth-quarter results.
The New Haven, Conn., designer and marketer of outerwear and active-wear said it intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit, describing the complaint as being "without merit."
The suit, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges, among other things, that Starter failed to reveal information about supply problems it was having with its winter outerwear products.
The company said the suit seeks an "unspecified amount of monetary damages."
