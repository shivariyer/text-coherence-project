A TABLE accompanying Tuesday's article on brokerage-house stock picks contained errors.
Harcourt General Inc. declined 19%, not 27%, while recommended by CS First Boston Corp. in the fourth quarter.
The firm's biggest quarterly loser therefore wasn't Harcourt but Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc., down 23%.
As a result, CS First Boston's list was up 0.1% for the quarter, instead of down 0.1%.
For the year, it was up 12.4%, not 12.2%.
The biggest winner recommended by Raymond James & Associates Inc. in the quarter was Cordis Corp., up 54%, rather than Stanley Furniture Co., up 41%.
The errors were made by Zacks Investment Research Inc., which prepared the table.

EASTMAN KODAK Co.'s stock closed at $44.125 a share on Jan. 31, down 0.8% from Dec. 31, 1993.
Yesterday's Investment Insight table incorrectly stated that the stock fell 21.56% because it failed to account for the spinoff of Eastman Chemical Co.
