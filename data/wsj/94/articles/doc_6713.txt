Specialty retailer Limited Inc., Columbus, Ohio, said it expects net income for the year to total about $390 million, or $1.08 a share, a bit lower than its previous estimate of $1.10 to $1.20 a share.
Based on nine-month results, the latest estimate suggests fourth-quarter earnings of around $200 million, or about 54 cents a share.
In the year ended Jan. 30, 1993, the company had net income of $455.5 million, or $1.25 a share.
Sales for the four-week period ended Jan. 29 fell 1% to $382.4 million, while sales for the 12 months rose 8% to $7.25 billion.
Comparable-store sales fell 9% for the four weeks and 1% for the year.
Leslie H. Wexner, chairman and chief executive officer, said 1993 results were slightly below the earlier forecast due to severe January weather and the Los Angeles earthquake.
Mr. Wexner said the company repurchased 5.3 million of its common shares during the fourth quarter.
The Limited operates 4,623 specialty stores and distributes Victoria's Secret Catalogue.
