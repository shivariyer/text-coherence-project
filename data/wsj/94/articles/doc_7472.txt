Securities and Exchange Commission member Richard Roberts cautioned securities firms that sell tax-exempt derivatives to take "all reasonable steps necessary" to make sure the securities are suitable investments for prospective buyers.
Derivatives are financial products whose value is derived from an underlying asset, rate or index.
Mr. Roberts said regulatory concerns about customer liability have grown as investment in tax-exempt derivative securities has broadened.
He estimated that at least $10 billion of tax-exempt derivative securities were issued last year alone, and said an expected fall-off in overall municipal-bond volume this year could spur greater demand for such derivatives.
He said most tax-exempt derivative products have been developed in an environment of falling interest rates and relatively favorable returns for municipals, and he cautioned that the liquidity of some of these products in a rising-interest-rate environment is unknown.
He noted that a special suitability rule for municipal-bond derivatives is possible.
Suitability rules, as their name implies, are meant to protect consumers from making investments that aren't suited to their financial needs.
At the same time, the SEC filed for public comment a proposal by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board to strengthen the board's customer-suitability rules.
The proposal would tighten the rules by removing language that was perceived by some as providing loopholes to the general requirement that before recommending an investment to a customer, a dealer first must determine that the proposed investment is suitable for the customer.
The SEC invited interested parties to submit comments by Feb. 17.
Mr. Roberts also said the SEC should reconsider a regulatory change that has made it easier for open-end mutual funds to increase their holdings of derivative instruments by allowing them to raise to 15% from 10% the amount of illiquid assets they may hold.
