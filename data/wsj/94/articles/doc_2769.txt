Beta Well Service Inc. said its negotiations to acquire a 25% interest in a petroleum joint venture in the Stavrapol region of Russia were broken off.
The Leduc oil-field services company said it wasn't able to conclude a definitive agreement with closely held Genesis Eurasia Corp., Houston, which currently owns 50% of the joint venture.
Beta had announced in January that it had signed a letter of intent with Genesis for the proposed transaction.
Beta said it is continuing previously announced negotiations to acquire interests in oil joint ventures in Kazakhstan and Russia's Komi Republic.
