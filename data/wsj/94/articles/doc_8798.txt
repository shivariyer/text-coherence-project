Fleming Cos. unveiled a consolidation plan that is expected to slash its work force by 2,000 people, or 9%, and result in a pretax fourth-quarter charge of about $101 million.
The Oklahoma City food distributor said the charge, which will create a fourth-quarter loss, will reduce earnings by about $62 million, or $1.68 a share.
Last month Fleming warned that its earnings for the period would be between 40 cents and 45 cents a share, much less than analysts had forecast, before a $2.7 million charge related to early retirement of debt.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, Fleming earned $24 million, or 66 cents a share.
The company said it expects its streamlining moves, to take place over the next two years, will reduce operating costs by at least $65 million a year.
But it said it foresees no improvement in earnings from its core operations before 1995.
The cost-cutting moves include closing five regional staff offices and consolidating several operating divisions.
