Japanese banks may make a faster-than-expected entry into all parts of the securities business, a senior official of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. said.
"Everybody says it may be 10 to 20 years" before the securities affiliates of Japanese banks are allowed to work in the secondary market for equities, said Makoto Fujimaki, vice president of DKB's securities division.
"But it may be just five years.
The trend of deregulation is in the market now, and things move faster than people think."
Japan's large commercial banks are expected to enter the securities business between this July and March 1995.
At first, the government will limit securities affiliates to underwriting corporate bonds and dealing in government bonds, which Mr. Fujimaki said will limit the profitability of DKB's securities affiliate.
The Ministry of Finance has privately urged banks' securities affiliates to turn a profit within three years, a target Mr. Fujimaki said will be hard to achieve.
"The business isn't that profitable," he said.
Given DKB's large nationwide branch network, he said, "we'd like to do retail business."
The DKB official noted, however, that the securities affiliates of both Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. and Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. may see a profit as early as the fiscal year ending this month, as a result of a run-up in bond prices in late 1993.
"The profit they're earning is much more than expected," he said.
But with long-term interest rates rising so far in 1994, "the timing may not be so good" for DKB's affiliate to match the feat, Mr. Fujimaki said.
