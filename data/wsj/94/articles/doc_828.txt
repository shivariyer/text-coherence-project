Three sports lawyers charged American Greetings Corp. with agreeing to sell sports greeting cards jointly, but then "secretly" developing the cards on its own.
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, the lawyers seek $10 million in compensatory damages and $30 million in punitive damages, plus a permanent injunction to stop American Greetings from selling professional sports greeting cards.
A spokesman for Cleveland-based American Greetings said company officials hadn't seen the lawsuit.
But based on a news release the plaintiffs issued, the spokesman said, "We see absolutely no merit in any of their claims."
According to the suit, the plaintiffs, Stephen W. Zucker, Eldon L. Ham and Steven T. Mandell in early 1992 conceived a plan to develop and sell greeting cards featuring the logos of professional sports teams and leagues.
Later that year, the plaintiffs approached American Greetings about a joint venture.
American Greetings said it would go forward with the joint venture, but then set up its own sports greeting-card program, the suit said.
