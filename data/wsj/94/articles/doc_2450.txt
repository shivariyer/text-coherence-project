Dow Jones & Co. announced agreements with eight newspapers in Latin America to provide them with a weekday, Spanish-language international business-news section.
The section, called The Wall Street Journal Americas, will be published in the morning editions of the newspapers Monday through Friday and will consist of two pages of news, including articles appearing in that day's Wall Street Journal and its international editions.
Publication is expected to start by midyear.
The eight newspapers that will publish The Wall Street Journal Americas section are all members of Grupo de Diarios America, a federation of leading Spanish-language newspapers in Latin America.
They have a combined weekday circulation of more than 1.1 million and an estimated readership of seven million.
The newspapers are El Norte in Monterrey, Mexico, and Reforma in Mexico City; El Tiempo in Bogota, Colombia; La Nacion in Buenos Aires; El Comercio in Lima, Peru; El Nacional in Caracas, Venezuela; El Comercio in Quito, Ecuador; and El Mercurio in Santiago, Chile.
"The Wall Street Journal Americas is a major step in providing more readers in Latin America with Wall Street Journal news on the same day it is published in the U.S., Europe and Asia," said Kenneth L. Burenga, president of Dow Jones and general manager of The Wall Street Journal.
"We are pleased to be working with leading newspapers in the area to make this possible."
A spokesman for Grupo de Diarios America said the venture "constitutes a renewed expression of the spirit of integration and globalization that characterizes the end of this century."
In addition to The Wall Street Journal and its international editions, Dow Jones publishes Barron's magazine and other periodicals, electronic business information services, including Dow Jones Telerate, and community newspapers.
