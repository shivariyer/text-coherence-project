AZTEC MANUFACTURING Co., Crowley, Texas, declared a special, one-time dividend of two cents a common share, but said it isn't resuming payment of quarterly cash dividends.
The dividend is payable March 28 to stockholders of record March 11.
The electrical-products maker last paid a quarterly dividend April 23.
An Aztec spokesman said payments were stopped because Aztec wanted to use the cash for further expansions and acquisitions.
The spokesman said the one-time dividend is being paid because the company, which paid quarterly dividends from 1969 to 1993, didn't want to break its string of payments completely.
Aztec has 5.6 million shares outstanding, the spokesman said.
