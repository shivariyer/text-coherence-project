Microsoft Corp. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co. have been in talks for several months about a broad technical alliance but haven't reached an agreement, executives from the two companies said.
The companies discussed ways AT&T might use Microsoft software, including operating systems that would control TV set-top decoder boxes for interactive television, according to people familiar with the companies' plans, which were first reported by Infoworld, a weekly trade publication.
AT&T and Microsoft executives would not discuss specific topics.
They said the talks are continuing, although no major deal is in the offing soon.
Steve Balmer, a Microsoft vice president, would not comment on whether Microsoft had asked AT&T to exclusively adopt his company's software for future network applications.
The big Redmond, Wash., software supplier has failed to line up support for a multi-company alliance that would use its software in setting standards in interactive television, in discussions that included New York-based AT&T, industry executives said.
Separately, Microsoft announced three agreements to license source code for its Microsoft Windows operating system to independent software vendors.
Microsoft doesn't typically license such code, which allows other companies to make modifications of Microsoft's technology for use in their own products.
The agreements, with Locus Computing Corp., MainSoft Corp. and Insignia Solutions Inc., will make it possible for companies to write one version of Windows application programs and have them also run on versions of the Unix operating system from companies that include International Business Machines Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., Microsoft said.
