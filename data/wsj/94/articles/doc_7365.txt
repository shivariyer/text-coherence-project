Export contracts signed by 19 major Japanese trading houses in December were down 8.6% from a year earlier to 889.9 billion yen ($8.19 billion), the Japan Foreign Trade Council said.
Import contracts were down 19.5% to 961.8 billion yen.
The group noted that total export contracts declined on an annual basis for the second straight month despite sharp increases in exports of pharmaceutical products and miscellaneous machinery.
Pharmaceutical exports to the U.S., Western Europe and China were up sharply.
But the group said exports of metals and textiles were sharply lower.
Steel exports, particularly to China and Western Europe, were notably lower, it said.
Meanwhile, imports of fuel products and metals fell, bringing import contracts lower for the third straight month.
The imports of fuel products were knocked back by lower crude oil prices and by declining imports of liquefied natural gas products, the group said.
The trade council also released data on trading contracts signed by Japanese trading houses for all of 1993.
Export contracts concluded during the year dropped 8.6% to 13.020 trillion yen, the third straight year they declined.
The figure represented the lowest level for a full year since 1979, when export contracts totaled 12.019 trillion yen.
Exports of most major products were down, with drops in machinery exports accounting for much of the overall decline.
Import contracts concluded during 1993 were off 11.6% to 13.713 trillion yen, also the third straight year of decline and the lowest level since 1979.
Import contracts totaled 12.323 trillion yen in 1979.
Although lumber imports rose in the year, lower fuel and metals imports contributed to the overall decline, the group said.
