Last year, new cars were the most affordable they've been in six years, according to a Comerica Bank study.
The average American family needed 30 weeks of work in the fourth quarter of 1993, earning $21,469, to afford a new car, according to the bank's "affordability index," which includes the average price of cars, lending rates and median family income, estimated at $37,232 in the fourth quarter.
That fourth-quarter rate was a drop from 30.2 weeks in the third quarter and brought the average for 1993 to 30.1 weeks, the lowest since 1987, when it took only 29 weeks of work to afford a car.
Cars became more affordable in the fourth quarter than in the third because of a continuing drop in interest rates and a $168 drop in the average purchase price of new vehicles, said David L. Littmann, Comerica's senior economist.
The index doesn't include the rising price of used cars, which has made new cars even more affordable because most cars are bought in a swap.
With the prospect of higher interest rates, Mr. Littmann doesn't expect affordability to improve in 1994.
