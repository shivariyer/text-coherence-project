Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said it may sell part of its Ketchikan Pulp Co. unit, which is the focus of a bitter environmental fight over logging and pollution in Alaska's ancient forests.
LP indicated that it is mulling the sale because Ketchikan Pulp is no longer part of what LP considers its core businesses, lumber and other building materials.
Ketchikan Pulp, based in Ketchikan, Alaska, near the giant Tongass National Forest, runs two sawmills, but its main business is a big mill that makes dissolvable pulp.
The market for dissolvable pulp is slumping because of weak demand and global overcapacity.
Ketchikan Pulp is a small part of LP's business, contributing only about $158 million of the parent company's $2.5 billion in 1993 sales.
The dissolvable pulp mill is considered by environmentalists and federal regulators as one of the worst water polluters in the country.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has raided the mill twice in the past 18 months to collect evidence for a continuing probe of possible criminal violations of federal environmental laws.
In addition, the federal government has filed a civil suit against Ketchikan Pulp, alleging myriad violations of the federal Clean Air Act and and Clean Water Act.
An LP spokesman said the company has no comment on the criminal probe, and said that it is negotiating to settle the civil suit.
He said upgrades and improvements at the pulp mill either have solved, or will soon solve, the facility's pollution problems.
Some analysts questioned whether LP can find a buyer.
Although LP says Ketchikan Pulp had pretax 1993 operating earnings of $20 million, the unit would probably have heavy losses if its long-term contract is revoked or revised.
