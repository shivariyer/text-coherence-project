Upjohn Co. said Swedish regulators approved its Caverject Sterile Powder for the treatment of male impotence, the first time a country has cleared the product for marketing.
Upjohn said male impotence affects an estimated 55 million men world-wide, and the company is seeking world-wide registration of Caverject.
The product, which a patient is taught to inject, encourages penile blood flow.
