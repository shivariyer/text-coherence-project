Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling 31,500 1988-model Ranger trucks equipped with 2.0-liter engines because of an emissions problem.
Ford said tests conducted by it and the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that some vehicles may emit oxides of nitrogen at levels that exceed U.S. and Canadian standards.
About 3,800 of these vehicles are in Canada, Ford said.
Ford dealers will make several modifications to the emissions system, including replacing the exhaust system catalyst and the exhaust gas recirculation valve.
Separately, Mercedes-Benz of North America said it is recalling 5,900 400E vehicles to fix a problem with a component involving the air-conditioning unit.
Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, said the problem involves all 1992- and some 1993-model vehicles.
Mercedes-Benz said a faulty hose in the system could cause a release of fuel vapor, near the auxiliary cooling fan, which could lead to a fire under the hood.
Mercedes-Benz said that there have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to the problem.
The company urged owners to stop using the air-conditioning system until repairs are made.
