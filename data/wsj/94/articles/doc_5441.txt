Oracle Systems Corp. said it planned to introduce three product lines to support the delivery of movies, information and other electronic services over the so-called information highway.
Oracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., said it will work with at least 17 media, comunications and electronics companies to push its software technology as a standard for managing data on the information highway.
Oracle's plans for this emerging business are well-known; the most prominent of its partnerships already have been announced.
But analysts said the stock rose $1 to $32.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading in response to further details.
Oracle, which sells and services database software, is expected to face stiff competition from Microsoft Corp. and others bent on supplying multimedia software.
But so far Oracle has been the most aggressive in staking a claim over this infant market.
Last week, the company said it would work with Apple Computer Inc. to produce TV set-top boxes for use by cable customers.
In January, the company said it will supply Bell Atlantic Corp. with multimedia software and services.
