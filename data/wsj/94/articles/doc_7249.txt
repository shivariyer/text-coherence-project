Gateway 2000 Inc., North Sioux City, S.D., said it expects to report fourth-quarter sales of more than $545 million, or 54% higher than a year earlier.
Earnings at the mail-order computer concern are estimated at 41 cents to 43 cents a share, for net income of $30 million to $31.5 million.
Gateway is expected to release its full financial results next week.
The company, which raised $163.5 million in an initial offering in December, attributed the sales gains to record demand for its multimedia personal computers, its portable PCs, and its machines based on Intel Corp.'s top-of-the-line Pentium microprocessor.
The company said its fourth-quarter revenue includes $15 million in sales from the European unit, opened in October.
For the year, Gateway put revenue at $1.73 billion, compared with $1.11 billion for 1992.
