The Financial Accounting Standards Board, yielding to pressure from banks, proposed dropping a requirement that would have reduced banks' profits related to troubled loans.
The requirement by the chief rulemaking body for accountants would have prohibited a bank, in certain instances, from taking into profit the interest from troubled loans.
But banks complained that the requirement was confusing and would have required them to make costly changes in their computer loan-interest programs overseen by bank regulators.
In Washington, D.C., Marti Sworobach, a spokeswoman for the 2,000-member Savings & Community Bankers of America, said that bankers "are pleased with FASB's change of heart on impaired loans."
Timothy Lucas, FASB's research director, said that the proposal will be issued shortly and voted on by the FASB after weighing public comment.
The broader rule containing the requirement, issued by the FASB in mid-1993, is scheduled to go into effect for banks' financial reports starting in 1995, he added.
