Crown Cork & Seal Co. said it will spend $20 million for a second production line at its newly opened beverage can and plastic closure plant in Buenos Aires.
The company said the $28 million plant recently began commercial shipments of cans to customers and has been producing plastic closures since the fourth quarter of 1993.
It expects can production from the new second 600 million cans-a-year line to double the plant's capacity by year end.
Crown Cork, a producer of metal and plastic containers and packaging machinery, reported $4 billion in 1993 sales.
