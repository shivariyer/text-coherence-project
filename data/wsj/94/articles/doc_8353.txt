Gaylord Entertainment Co. said it has talked with several companies in recent months about the possibility of forming a "strategic alliance."
The company's comments were made in response to a Jan. 19 page-one article in The Wall Street Journal.
In that article, E.W. Wendell, president and chief executive officer of the media company, indicated that Gaylord hasn't attracted any significant acquisition attention.
Yesterday, in a statement, Mr. Wendell said: "From time to time over the past several months, the company has received preliminary contacts from, and has engaged in discussions with, companies with whom the company could forge a strategic business alliance.
However, no such discussions are ongoing by either the company or the Gaylord family interests."
In addition, Mr. Wendell said, "Given the majority ownership of Edward L. Gaylord and his family, it is difficult to imagine the company being the subject of a hostile or unfriendly takeover."
