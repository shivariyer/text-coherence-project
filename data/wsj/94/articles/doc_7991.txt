The Justice Department said it won't challenge on antitrust grounds a plan by insurance companies to create a computer database through which price information could be shared.
In a letter to Insurance Services Office Inc., a nonprofit company comprised of 1,400 property and casualty insurers, Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general for antitrust, said federal law exempts the insurance industry from antitrust laws.
Insurance Services plans to sell its program, which contains public record information, primarily to insurance companies and state regulators.
Ms. Bingaman indicated the department ordinarily would be concerned about the proposal because it could be used by insurers to fix prices.
The McCarran-Ferguson Act, however, "immunizes from antitrust enforcement `the business of insurance to the extent that such business is . . . regulated by state law,'" she said in her letter.
In July, she told Congress she favors narrowing that exemption's scope.
David Ostwald, the company's vice president for corporate communications, said his product would boost rather than hamper competition, because "information is the oxygen of competition."
Knowledge of what the competition is charging doesn't lead to price fixing, he added.
Ms. Bingaman's letter indicated that Justice Department officials relied on ISO representations that state regulations adequately cover its proposal.
"If state regulation is not as you represent it or if it should change, the department could take a different position on the application of the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption to ISO's development and marketing of its proposed premium-comparison product," she wrote.
