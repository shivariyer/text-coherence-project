Japan Inc. is about to get a new face.
Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor Co., has been offered the chairmanship of Keidanren, Japan's leading big-business lobby.
Mr. Toyoda, 68 years old, said in a statement Friday that he is considering the offer, and he is widely expected to accept.
Mr. Toyoda, now vice chairman of Keidanren, would succeed Gaishi Hiraiwa, 79, who has served in the post for three years.
Mr. Toyoda's appointment marks a symbolic changing of the guard for Japan's stodgy business community.
Although Japan's auto industry has risen to international prominence over the past two decades, the internationally oriented car makers -- even conservative Toyota -- were a bit too independent for Japan Inc.'s blood.
So Keidanren chose its leaders from graying industries like steel.
Mr. Hiraiwa, for example, hails from Tokyo Electric Power Co., an electric utility.
Mr. Toyoda will take over Keidanren at a critical point in the lobby's history.
Big business is struggling to overcome Japan's stubborn recession, the worst since World War II.
