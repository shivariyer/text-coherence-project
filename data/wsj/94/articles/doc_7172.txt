J.P. Morgan & Co.'s investment in a failed Spanish bank has spurred a House Banking Committee study of the Federal Reserve Board's regulation of overseas activities of U.S. banks.
Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) asked Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, a series of questions about the Fed's oversight of Morgan's purchase of an interest in Banco Espanol de Credito, or Banesto, through a closedend investment fund called Corsair Partnership L.P.
Several months after the partnership invested $166 million in Banesto, the bank was seized in December by the central bank of Spain.
In addition, the panel asked the Fed for information about how it regulates bank-run "vulture funds," which invest in sick companies that are expected to get well and prosper.
The panel is concerned that such funds may become vehicles for bank purchases of large blocks of shares in both financial and nonfinancial companies.
