Standard & Poor's Corp. said financial regulators took 47 actions against U.S. insurers in 1993, down from 68 a year earlier.
S&P's insurance rating service said the reduction reflects reduced, but still high, property catastrophe losses, better quality life insurer investment portfolios, and reasonably strong after-tax earnings.
The S&P tally said regulators shut down 17 life/health insurers with about $1.3 billion in liabilities last year, the lowest total since 1986, when 16 insurers failed.
Insurers were aided by a rising stock market, substantial funds paid by owners, generally favorable health insurance market conditions, and renewed consumer interest in tax-deferred life and annuity products.
In addition, many companies restructured their portfolios, primarily divesting junk bonds.
Looking forward, Steven Dreyer, director of insurance ratings services, said health insurance profits will probably be squeezed by cyclical and political pressures, and any significant rise in interest rates would have an adverse impact.
Thirty property/casualty insurers with liabilities of more than $300 million failed in 1993, the fewest number since 1987, when 19 were taken over by regulators.
Despite such catastrophic claims as the World Trade Center bombing, the March North Eastern storm, California fires, and Midwest floods, "there was no rash of insolvencies as there was following Hurricane Andrew in 1992," the analysis said.
"The capital position of the property/casualty industry improved in 1993 thanks to lower underwriting losses and continued high levels of realized and unrealized capital gains."
