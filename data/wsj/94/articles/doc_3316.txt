The European Union Commission said it cleared the takeover of German plastics company Huels Troisdorf AG by chemical and plastics group Ruetgerswerke AG, a unit of Ruhrkohle AG.
In a statement, the Commission said although the takeover will give Ruetgers a bigger share of the European copper-clad laminates market, the company won't be able to impose significant price increases because of competitive pressure from clients in the electronics industry.
Copper-clad laminates are used in producing printed circuit boards.
Ruetgers already had the biggest European market share of copper-clad glass laminates, while Huels Troisdorf was the biggest producer of copper-clad paper laminates, so the acquisition strengthens Ruetgers competitive position.
However, the Commission found that there are alternative sources of supply of laminates outside and inside the EU.
The Commission has the power to block or alter agreements that create or strengthen dominant positions on the EU-market.
