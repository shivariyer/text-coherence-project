Borland International Inc., Scotts Valley, Calif., reported third-quarter profit of $418,000, or two cents a share, falling far short of analysts' average estimates of about 11 cents.
The software maker attributed the results largely to lower sales in Europe of its dBase software, as customers held off purchases in anticipation of a forthcoming version tailored for Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system.
In the year-earlier period, Borland had a loss of $61.3 million, or $2.34 a share, because of costs associated with layoffs and other restructuring charges.
Quarterly sales rose 7.1% to $111.7 million, from $104.3 million a year earlier.
Philippe Kahn, chief executive officer, said Borland focused in the quarter on gaining market share and helping customers "upsize" their computing tasks from individual personal computers to machines connected in so-called client-server networks.
