Insurance broker Sedgwick Group PLC said that its pretax profit rose 24% in 1993, helped by a 9% advance in brokerage and fee income, as well as the dollar's gains against sterling.
Pretax profit jumped to #70.5 million ($104.5 million) from #56.7 million.
Sales rose 18% to #809.7 million from #684.9 million.
The pretax advance was in line with market forecasts, as was the group's decision to maintain its full-year dividend at six pence (8.9 cents) a share.
The group was upbeat about its immediate prospects, saying that "with economic recovery now evident in the U.S. and some economic improvement in the U.K., Sedgwick's business is well positioned to make progress in 1994 against a background of a strong dollar and generally firm or stable insurance pricing worldwide."
