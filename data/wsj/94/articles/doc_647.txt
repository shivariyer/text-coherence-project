Computer Sciences Corp. said it signed an agreement with British Aerospace PLC to buy British Aerospace's internal information-technology systems for about $112 million and to provide services back to the British company for 10 years.
Terms of the so-called outsourcing arrangement have been sweetened since last November, when British Aerospace announced its preliminary agreement with Computer Sciences.
Computer Sciences, El Segundo, Calif., earlier said it would provide services back to British Aerospace for $134 million annually; it said that the contract value in the first year has risen to about $149 million.
Computer Sciences will buy British Aerospace's existing facilities and equipment and employ some 1,500 British Aerospace information-technology workers.
Computer Sciences will provide to British Aerospace services that the London defense and commercial aerospace manufacturer previously supplied internally, including managing data centers, communications networks and data processing for more than a dozen business units.
