Utility stocks are seen as a leading indicator for the equity market as a whole, and for the bond market.
A big drop in utilities last fall foreshadowed the Federal Reserve's credit tightening earlier this month, said Joseph McAlinden, chief investment officer at Dillon Read & Co.
"The story continues to be money is flowing into some cyclicals and it is flowing out of some interest-rate-sensitive stocks," said Philip Roth, a technical analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.
That shift makes sense, he said, because the economy is improving and rates likely will rise.
Analysts played down the significance of a downbeat economic reading yesterday morning.
The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 18% in January, much further than expected.
The drop, though, was blamed on poor weather conditions during the month.
Some of the nervousness about interest rates emerged in anticipation of today's scheduled Labor Department report on its consumer-price index.
Economists expect the inflation barometer to show a modest gain of about 0.3% for last month.
Mr. McAlinden, the Dillon Read officer, said stocks could react sharply if the CPI number surprises investors.
He projected sizable gains on a reading of 0.2% or lower and a sell-off on a gain of 0.5% or more.
