Morgan Stanley Co. moved to cash out all of its substantial investments in Coltec Industries Inc. in a proposed secondary offering that could raise more than $450 million for Morgan and other investors.
Coltec shares declined $1.375 a share, or 6.5%, to $19.625 after the announcement.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coltec said the investors plan to sell 23.2 million common shares, which would be worth about $455 million at yesterday's closing price.
The investors, including Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II L.P., plan to sell about 33% of the company's 69.6 million common shares outstanding.
The price they paid for the shares wasn't available.
Coltec, a maker of aerospace, automotive and other industrial products, had 1993 revenue of $1.3 billion.
It was taken private in a leveraged buyout in 1988 for about $660 million and went public in March 1992 at $15 a share.
