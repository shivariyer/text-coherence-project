The heavy-equipment maker said its Brazilian automotive subsidiary plans to go public through an initial offering valued at up to $170 million.
The company's Clark Automotive Products unit filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering a planned offering of 10 million shares.
Of those, Clark will sell 9,174,194 shares, and Clark Automotive will sell 825,806 shares.
While its operations are in Campinas, Brazil, Clark Automotive is incorporated in Michigan, and has headquarters in South Bend.
The offering, with an estimated price range of from $14 to $17 a share, will be managed by CS First Boston Corp.
The unit makes manual transmissions and related aftermarket parts for sale in Brazil and the U.S.
It had 1993 sales of $184.3 million, Clark said, and had after-tax earnings of $12.1 million.
The underwriters have been granted an overallotment option of one million shares, Clark said.
After the sale, Clark Equipment will hold at maximum a 10% stake in the Brazilian unit; if the overallotment option is exercised in full, the parent's stake would drop to zero, a spokesman said.
