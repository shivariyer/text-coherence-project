A.H. Belo Corp. said it agreed in principle to acquire the assets of WWL-TV, the CBS Inc. affiliate in New Orleans, from Rampart Operating Partnership, a closely held Louisiana partnership, for $110 million in cash.
The sale is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approvals by the appropriate federal agencies, the media concern said.
The agreement in principle has already been approved by the Belo board and the principals of Rampart, the company said.
A Belo spokesman said that he couldn't estimate when the transaction might be completed.
Belo, which is based in Dallas and also publishes newspapers, already owns network-affiliated television stations in Dallas, Houston, Sacramento, Calif., Hampton-Norfolk, Va., and Tulsa, Okla.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Belo closed at $52.875, up 62.5 cents.
