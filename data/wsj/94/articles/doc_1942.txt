Gitano Group Inc. said U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Jeffry Gallet in New York approved the previously announced agreement for Chicago-based Fruit of the Loom Inc. to buy the assets of Gitano for $100 million.
The two companies announced the purchase agreement on March 1, the same day that Gitano filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
The Gitano spokesman said the sale is expected to close by the end of this week.
