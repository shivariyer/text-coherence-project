Cott Corp. said it reached an agreement with the beverage unit of Cadbury Schweppes PLC, to provide marketing and package-design services for retailer-branded soft drinks produced in Europe by Cadbury.
The five-year agreement is subject to regulatory review in Europe.
Cott, a Mississauga, Ontario, private-label soft-drink concern, currently has nominal sales in Europe.
Cott also granted Cadbury, based in the U.K., an option to acquire a 49% stake in Cott's European unit, the terms of which weren't disclosed.
