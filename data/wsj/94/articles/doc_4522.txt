Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. said a federal appeals court upheld a $15 million award granted it in its legal battle against Nintendo of America Inc.
As reported, in July 1992 a lower federal court had awarded Lewis Galoob the $15 million.
The amount represented profit lost by the South San Francisco, Calif., toy maker between June 1990 and July 1991, when it was barred from selling its Game Genie video game device for Nintendo machines as a result of a Nintendo lawsuit charging Lewis Galoob with copyright infringement.
Nintendo eventually lost that lawsuit, leading to the court's $15 million award.
Nintendo of America is a unit of Japan's Nintendo Co.
Yesterday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, upheld that award, which had been challenged by Nintendo.
Nintendo couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
It can appeal the latest ruling.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lewis Galoob closed at $8.375, down 25 cents.
