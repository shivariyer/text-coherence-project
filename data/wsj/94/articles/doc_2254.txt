Mazda Motor Corp., slammed by a plunge in auto sales in Japan and abroad, said it expects to post a deeper-than-expected loss in the year ending March 31, and losses will continue next year.
Mazda said it will record a pretax loss of 45 billion yen ($427.6 million).
That compares with its earlier forecast of a 32 billion yen loss and a 6.24 billion yen profit last year.
The company said sales will plummet to 1.77 trillion yen, down 19% from last year.
Mazda also said it won't be able to pay a dividend this year or next.
Mazda's plight toughens the challenge facing a group of senior executives that Ford Motor Co. is sending to Japan this year to help rescue the company.
Ford owns a 25% stake in the auto maker.
Mazda Executive Vice President Makoto Miyaji told a news conference that the company will strive to reduce the size of the loss for next fiscal year by cutting costs.
"It was the sharp drop in sales that we couldn't predict," he said.
The sharp appreciation of the yen against the dollar and other major currencies, which makes Japanese products more expensive overseas, also exacerbated the slump in Mazda's business.
