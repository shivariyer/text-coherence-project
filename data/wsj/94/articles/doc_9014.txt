Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and Washington Post Co. said they will work with Oracle Corp. to develop electronic services that include news on demand.
The two media companies plan to develop the services using Oracle database software that allows large computers to store and retrieve still pictures, video and sound as well as text.
They didn't disclose a timetable for introducing the services, but said they hope to participate in interactive TV trials planned this year for several cities.
Capital Cities/ABC, whose properties include ABC Television as well as newspapers and radio stations, plans to combine video footage and text information to create news services that can be customized.
For example, a viewer watching a nightly news broadcast on Bosnia might use her TV remote control to call up related news footage, text and maps that would help explain the conflict, said Bruce Maggin, executive vice president in charge of the New York-based company's multimedia group.
Similarly, Washington Post said it hopes to develop new forms of electronic publications and advertising that could allow users to pick and choose information they receive.
It has agreed to work with Oracle to market whatever services are developed.
Donald Brazeal, editor and publisher of a new multimedia subsidiary called Digital Ink, said text and visual material will come from its flagship newspaper, Newsweek magazine and other Post properties, as well as other sources of video programming.
Oracle, which plans a formal announcement of its so-called server software tomorrow, is aggressively courting customers to deliver computerized video, music and other multimedia material.
Bell Atlantic Corp. chose Oracle's software last week to begin delivering interactive video services over telephone networks.
