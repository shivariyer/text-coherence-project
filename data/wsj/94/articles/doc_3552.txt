After months of pressing for changes in the municipal-bond business, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt finally took his message to a group that will be greatly affected by it, state treasurers.
According to the text of a speech that was delivered yesterday in a closed-door meeting here with the National Association of State Treasurers, Mr. Levitt conceded that the SEC and other federal regulators "have limited authority over the public debt markets."
But he urged the treasurers, many of whom control their states' issuance of bonds, to take voluntary reform measures, including more frequent use of competition, rather than negotiation, in selecting bond underwriters.
Treasurers "could also consider advocating uniform state legislation that would require a Chinese wall between the political process and the underwriting of bonds," Mr. Levitt said.
"I urge you to start the dialogue on these issues within your state -- because the implication that tax dollars are being directed on the basis of political contributions hurts elected and appointed officials more than anyone else," he said.
To date, most of Mr. Levitt's work on municipal-bond reform has been dedicated to encouraging underwriters on Wall Street to stop making campaign contributions to politicians who can award bond business.
That initiative -- to end a practice called "pay to play" -- has set Mr. Levitt at odds with many state and local elected officials, including treasurers.
Early in his speech, Mr. Levitt acknowledged that he had rankled the treasurers.
"I'd like to remove the misperception that I believe your office is routinely bought and sold," Mr. Levitt said.
"I don't, and I have never said so."
