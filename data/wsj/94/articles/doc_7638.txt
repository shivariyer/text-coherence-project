U.S. Long Distance Corp., San Antonio, canceled plans to sell 1.6 million of its shares to the public, in the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company's accounting.
The long-distance and operator-services company had put the offering on hold last month, citing the informal SEC probe.
In canceling the offering, the company said the inquiry wasn't a factor.
Of the 1.6 million shares in that offering, 1.2 million were to be sold by the company and 400,000 by certain stockholders, including officers.
Yesterday, the company said it would register with the SEC plans for certain stockholders, not including officers, to sell about 1.5 million shares.
The SEC inquiry relates to the accounting of certain receivables that the company acquires.
The company contends its financial results are fairly stated.
