The New Year's rally in stocks has a dark side: the valuation picture is getting uglier and uglier.
Analysts in a bearish mood are especially fond of citing one of the popular valuation measures -- the stock market's dividend yield, or the amount of money paid as dividends as a percentage of share prices.
That measure, calculated on the past year's dividends, has been in what many technical analysts consider the danger zone for two years.
But as stock prices move ever higher, the alarm is ringing louder.
"The market at these levels resembles more of a gambling casino than an investment arena," says Geraldine Weiss, editor of Investment Quality Trends, a La Jolla, Calif., newsletter.
At Friday's record close of 3867.20 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the dividend yield on that index of 30 blue-chip stocks fell to 2.62% from an already meager 2.7% at the start of the new year and far below the average 4.4% of the past few decades.
Many analysts believe that when the industrial average or Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is yielding less than 3%, stocks are dangerously pricey.
Eventually, they argue, yields will rise to the long-term average either through falling prices or rising dividends.
Although the dividend yield has been flashing danger signals for more than two years, some strategists are paying more attention to it today because the environment investors are facing is different.
For starters, the bull market is already 40 months old and way past retirement age.
What's more, interest rates, which were falling fast and furiously for the past two years, appear to be bottoming.
They're more likely to rise than drop in the coming months.
Though low interest rates have managed to prolong the bull market, strategists say it's only logical that when interest rates begin to tick up, investors will start focusing again on traditional valuation measures.
And when they do, they may be in for a rude awakening.
Ms. Weiss says that while she expects dividends to rise at a vigorous 6% pace this year, even that won't be enough to support today's lofty stock prices.
Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook newsletter, adds that even if stock prices made no further gains and dividends grew 10%, the dividend yield on stocks would rise to only 2.94% by the end of 1994.
"It's extremely worrisome," he says.
"If the S&P 500 moves up another five to seven points, we will be at the lowest dividend yield in modern history."
To be sure, stock market bulls don't dismiss the dividend yield as a valuation tool, but they contend that it has to be looked at in the context of interest rates.
"It's not the absolute level of 3% that is key," says Elaine Garzarelli, stock strategist at Lehman Brothers.
"It's the relationship of the dividend yield on stocks with other investment alternatives that is important."
Ms. Garzarelli says her studies have shown that the dividend yield has historically run at 43% of the average of the Treasury's three-month bill rate and the 30-year bond yield.
As long as her other stock market indicators are flashing bullish signals, that would suggest the dividend yield on stocks could go as low as 2% before it's comparable to past bull market peaks, she says.
What's more, corrections generally don't occur when the spread between the dividend yield on stocks and the Treasury's three-month bill rate is as small as it is now.
Ms. Garzarelli says that the spread between the two barometers would have to widen to 100 basis points before she started calling for a 10% to 15% correction in stock prices.
Right now, the gap between the two is 40 basis points.
Other analysts such as Laszlo Birinyi, who heads a consulting firm that bears his name, say sentiment will be more critical to the demise of the bull market than the dividend yield.
"When everybody says the 3% dividend yield doesn't matter anymore, that will set my alarm off," says Mr. Birinyi.
He argues that there are too many investors fretting about valuation tools like dividend yield and price-earnings for there to be a significant correction in the market today.
None of this is to say that all stocks are expensive.
George Shirk, research analyst at the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Institute for Econometric Research, is bearish on the overall stock market, but nevertheless finds pockets of cheap stocks.
One favorite shopping area is bank stocks.
Mr. Shirk notes that the average bank stock sports a dividend yield of around 3%.
The key, he says, is to snap up bank issues on small price retreats that boost their dividend yields, hopefully temporarily.
Mr. Shirk finds an attractive investment opportunity in Storage Equities, a real-estate investment trust that buys ministorage warehouses.
The stock, which gained 1/8 on Friday to 14 5/8, has a generous yield of 5.7%.
"This pays a yield similar to long-term bonds," says Mr. Shirk.
"But it's not going to be interest rate-sensitive because the company has paid down a lot of debt over the past year."
