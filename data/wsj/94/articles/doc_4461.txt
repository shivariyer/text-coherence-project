A Japanese government official reportedly has suggested that Japan will abandon its analog high-definition television system, touching off a firestorm among the electronics makers who have invested billions of yen in developing HDTV televisions and broadcast equipment.
Akimasa Egawa, director-general of the broadcast bureau at Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said that Japan will begin developing a digital HDTV system similar to those under development in the U.S. and Europe to replace the existing analog system, which Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) began developing more than 30 years ago.
Mr. Egawa also said the ministry will eventually bring an end to the experimental analog HDTV broadcasts that it began in late 1991.
Mr. Egawa's comments were first reported by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, and later confirmed in a general way by a different postal-ministry official.
Mr. Egawa himself could not be reached for comment.
NHK immediately issued a press release denouncing Mr. Egawa's reported remarks as "very regrettable."
