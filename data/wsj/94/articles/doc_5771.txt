Ground Round Restaurants Inc., citing a recent drop in its stock price, said it withdrew its proposed public offering for $35 million of convertible subordinated debentures.
As a result, the Boston restaurant operator said it will write off expenses of about $650,000 during its fiscal second quarter ending April 3.
In last year's second quarter, the company had net income of $1.2 million, or 11 cents a share, on sales of $56.4 million.
Ground Round said it knew of no corporate developments to explain the drop in its share price in the past two weeks, to $6.50 from $7.875.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, Ground Round shares rose 12.5 cents to $6.75.
The company said the move won't change its schedule for restaurant openings through 1995.
