The top executive of a leading Japanese oil refiner with close ties to two American oil giants is resigning, in an apparent clash between the two nations' corporate cultures.
Tonen Corp., 50% of which is owned by Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., said Friday that company President Nobuyuki Nakahara would leave office on March 30.
Tonen officials said Mr. Nakahara, who oversaw Tonen's growth as a technologically advanced and financially conservative refiner, was leaving because he already had been president for eight years, according to Japanese press reports.
Industry observers, however, widely believe Mr. Nakahara, a 34-year company veteran whose father was one of Tonen's original managing directors, was ousted as part of a longstanding campaign by Exxon and Mobil for more say in the management of Tonen.
For years, the two U.S. companies have pressed for a greater return on their investment, including a higher dividend pay out on their shares.
Neither Mr. Nakahara nor executives of the U.S. companies were available for comment.
