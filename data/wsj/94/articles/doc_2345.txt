AN AGING population in the U.S. means a population at increasing risk of chronic and costly health problems, but young people have health problems as well.
The average child under the age of five suffered from nearly four acute conditions in 1992, finds the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Health Interview Survey.
Children aged five to 17 years old averaged 2.4 conditions that year, while adults aged 18 and older averaged fewer than two.
The survey defines acute conditions as illnesses and injuries associated with a doctor's visit or ones that restrict a person's regular activities, such as work or school.
Respiratory conditions, including colds and influenza, are the most commonly reported.
The average preschooler suffered from 1.6 respiratory conditions in 1992, compared with 1.2 for school-aged children and fewer than one per adult.
This may be partly because young children are more susceptible than older people to such illnesses.
Parents also may be more likely to take sick children to the doctor or keep them home than to do the same themselves when they have similar symptoms.
Young adults are most likely to report injuries that require attention or restrict activities, at a rate of 31 per 100 people aged 18 to 24 in 1992.
For children under 18 and adults aged 25 to 44, the rate is about 30 per 100; 15 per 100 for adults aged 45 to 64, and for those aged 65 and older, the rate is 21 per 100.
Those aged 18 to 24 have the highest reported rate of sprains and strains, while children under five years old have the highest rates of open wounds and lacerations.
Children and youth aged five to 24 have the highest rates of fractures and dislocations.
Las Vegas Ranks No. 1
THE NEW YORK-Northern New Jersey-Long Island consolidated metropolitan area gained 120,500 people between 1990 and 1992, compared with 118,400 in Las Vegas.
But Las Vegas was the nation's fastest-growing metropolitan area during those two years, while New York ranked 228 out of 268.
The population of the New York consolidated area is approaching 20 million, according to recent U.S. Census Bureau estimates, so even a gain of 120,500 people represents an increase of less than 1%.
Las Vegas's population grew to 971,200 in 1992 from 852,700 in 1990, a 14% gain.
Fourteen metropolitan areas each gained more than 100,000 people between 1990 and 1992.
As of July 1, 1992, the date for the estimates, Las Vegas was the only big gainer with a population of less than 1 million, but it may have passed that threshold by now.
The biggest gainers' cumulative increase of 2.5 million people accounted for 39% of all U.S. growth.
The Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County consolidated area gained more than 516,200 people in two years, a 4% increase to 15 million.
Some population growth in metropolitan areas, particularly those in California and other coastal states, comes from immigration.
Many of these areas also benefit from internal migration, while others suffer from it.
Between 1990 and 1992, 20 metropolitan areas lost population.
As with growth, the largest losses aren't always the biggest declines.
The Boston-Worcester-Lawrence consolidated area lost 16,600 people, but this was just 0.3% of its 1990 population.
Jacksonville, N.C., lost 5,300 people, but its population declined by almost 4% in two years.
COLLEGE DAYS aren't as carefree as many may think.
College students worry about a lot of things these days, especially money.
One in three freshmen surveyed last fall said that low tuition was a very important reason for choosing their school, the most students to cite that reason in the 28-year history of an annual survey of college freshmen conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA and sponsored by the American Council on Education.
The same record share said that offers of financial assistance weighed heavily in their school decision.
In contrast, just 17% of freshmen -- the lowest level in the survey's history -- considered tuition costs important in 1979; just 14% felt that way about financial assistance in 1976.
College students also are worried about their future financial security.
Three in four freshmen surveyed last fall said that being able to make more money is a very important reason for attending college, up from 50% in 1971.
Eighty-two percent cite being able to get a better job as an important reason, compared with a historic low of 71% in 1976.
Pursuing an advanced degree takes more effort, time and money, but it also may pay off in future earnings, as well putting off the day when graduates have to face the full-time job market.
A record 65% of 1993 college freshmen plan to extend their educations beyond a bachelor's degree.
For the first time in the survey's history, women are now more likely than men to plan to pursue all types of advanced degrees, including master's, doctorates, law and medical.
SIXTY-TWO PERCENT of adults think that care in a child's own home is the best arrangement for infants, according to a survey conducted for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, based in Washington, D.C., by the Gallup Organization.
Only 44% think this situation is the best one for toddlers.
Thirty-one percent prefer child-care centers for toddlers, while 16% would choose the centers for infants.
