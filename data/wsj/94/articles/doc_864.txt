Yesterday, Congressman Jim Leach took to the floor of the House of Representatives to lay out in detail his complaint against the Clinton presidency, as embodied in the events that now run under the general banner of Whitewater.
Mr. Leach's speech offered to a great extent the "road map" that so many people interested in this issue have been asking for.
Then, as we went to press last evening, President Clinton was scheduled to appear in a news conference, perhaps to address these issues and his own political agenda.
With much of the public now trying to come to grips with the details of this story, C-SPAN will likely broadcast around 1 p.m. this Sunday both Mr. Clinton's news conference and Rep. Leach's floor speech.
In the end, it is a public in possession of large amounts of public information that should render some political judgment about this matter.
