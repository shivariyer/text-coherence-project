Dime Financial Corp. said it plans to "increase substantially" its reserves for loan losses and other real estate it owns, resulting in an anticipated fourth-quarter loss of $26 million.
Dime Financial, the Wallingford, Conn., holding company for Dime Savings Bank of Wallingford, said the reserves will be taken to cover significant losses that may result from the possible bulk sale of nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate this year.
The company said it expects the additional reserves to total about $29 million, but that a final determination won't be made until a continuing portfolio evaluation is completed.
The expected quarterly loss of $5.20 a share is against year-earlier earnings of $416,000, or nine cents a share.
The anticipated 1993 loss of $26 million will reduce shareholders' equity to $39 million from about $64 million.
The company said its leverage capital ratio may temporarily fall below the 6% level agreed to with regulators in February 1993.
