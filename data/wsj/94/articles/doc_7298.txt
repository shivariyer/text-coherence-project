As someone not fortunate enough to live and work in New York City, but fortunate enough to be able to partake of much of what it has to offer, I was amazed to read Susan Hauser's Leisure & Arts article ("Bored on Fifth: Away from Home Together," Dec. 28) about someone visiting New York and finding nothing for her and her children to do!
Instead of staying cooped up in the Plaza Hotel, all she had to do was walk across one street to FAO Schwartz or across another to Central Park, or out the door and around the corner to Rumplemayer's (much more fun and less expensive than room service) or out the door and down the street to the tree at Rockefeller Center, not to mention the Christmas show, the museums, the display of toy soldiers and submarines at the Forbes Gallery, etc. etc.
What a shame she spent all the money she dutifully accounts for in her article and received such a poor return.
She must come back and do herself and her children a favor and venture out into the most wonderful city in the world.
Together their fantasies will be fulfilled and they will find reality in New York exceeds expectations.

Ms. Hauser's story on her family's stay at the Plaza brings to mind our own long weekend in New York this time last year.
While not the Plaza, the midtown Marriott proved an excellent base for three days of typical New York City tourism -- jogging in Central Park, Broadway theater, FAO Schwartz, the Metropolitan Museum, Bloomingdales, etc.
When Dan (then 11, now 12) recently re-viewed "Home Alone 2," he begged us to take him back to New York -- though I don't believe his image of the city's wonder relates to Ms. Hauser's concept of hanging out in the confines of a hotel.
