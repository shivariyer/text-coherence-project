Northwest Airlines said January traffic slipped 4.5%, to 4.39 billion revenue passenger miles from 4.60 billion a year earlier.
A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile.
The carrier's load factor, or percentage of seats filled, rose to 62.3% from 61.2%, however.
The improvement reflects a decline in overall capacity.
