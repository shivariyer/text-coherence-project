Rep. Danny Rostenkowski's victory in the Democratic primary last week shows that the prince of pork-barrel politics still has plenty of buddies in Chicago.
The Chicago Sun-Times, however, is not among them, a fact we got wrong in an editorial Friday ("Congratulations, Danny").
In fact, the Sun-Times seems to share our view of the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
In an editorial endorsing rival John Cullerton, a state senator, the Sun-Times wrote: "Neither pork nor Bill Clinton's success is important enough to tolerate Rostenkowski's continued assault on public integrity."
We couldn't have said it better ourselves.
