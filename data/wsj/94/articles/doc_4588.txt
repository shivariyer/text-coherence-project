The federal fund that insures bank deposits showed a balance of $13.1 billion at the end of 1993, a turnaround from a deficit of $101 million at the end of 1992.
The surge in reserves brings the banking industry closer to the day when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. can reduce the premiums that banks pay into the Bank Insurance Fund, which insures individual deposits of as much as $100,000.
A 1991 law says the premium for deposit insurance can't fall below an average of 23 cents for each $100 of domestic deposits until the fund rises to 1.25% of deposits.
As of Dec. 31, the ratio was 0.69% of insured deposits.
In 1991, the insurance fund was $7.03 billion in the red, after taking account of reserves set aside for projected bank failures.
Pessimists in and out of Congress feared that a wave of bank failures would drain the fund, forcing taxpayers to pay for the deposit insurance that backs bank accounts, just as they as they did for thrifts.
But the banking industry recovered rapidly, failures ground to a halt, and the fund soared.
Forty-one banks failed last year, the lowest number since 1981.
The failures cost the fund $566 million.
In 1992, 120 banks failed, costing the fund $4.7 billion.
With bank earnings soaring and bank failures slowing, the FDIC reduced the fund's reserves for future failures by $7.7 billion last year.
On top of that, the premiums paid by banks exceeded the costs of failures by $5 billion.
The FDIC also announced that it has repaid with interest a total of $15.1 billion it borrowed from the Treasury to help paper over the fund's deficits.
Agency officials were understandably exultant.
"The recapitalization of the Bank Insurance Fund is a success story for the banking industry, the American taxpayer and the FDIC," said Andrew Hove, acting FDIC chairman.
"We can all take price and comfort in knowing that the FDIC hasn't used a single penny of taxpayer money to cover costs of bank failures."
