Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio, said its board approved the purchase of as many as 10 million shares of common stock in anticipation of using it to acquire Premier Bancorp Inc., Baton Rouge, La.
A spokesman for Banc One said the company hasn't decided whether to exercise its option to purchase Premier.
He added, however, that the shares the company is purchasing "are specified for this transaction if it occurs."
In 1992, Banc One received Federal Reserve Board approval to acquire a large stake in then-troubled Premier.
Banc One at the time purchased $65 million of newly issued Premier capital notes and received the option to acquire Premier between June 30, 1995, and March 31, 1997.
Premier has assets of $4.2 billion.
Banc One has $79.9 billion in assets.
Separately, Banc One approved a 10% stock dividend payable March 4 to stock of record Feb. 16.
The regular quarterly dividend of 31 cents a share will be paid March 31 to stock of record March 15.
Banc One said the cash dividend will be paid on the new shares resulting from the stock distribution.
