Senate leaders scheduled a vote next week on the proposed balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, signaling that majority Democrats think they have enough votes to kill it.
Debate over the budget-balancing issue began to take final shape when Sen. Harry Reid (D., Nev.) offered an alternative to the main amendment sponsored by Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.).
Mr. Simon's opponents -- including the Democratic leadership, Appropriations Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) and the White House -- intend the Reid proposal to provide protection for nervous party members who oppose the balanced-budget amendment but fear the political consequences of blocking it.
Passage of any constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority, or votes of 67 senators.
Mr. Reid's proposal is considered certain to fail because the vast majority of Republicans will oppose it, and the Simon proposal now has just 62 supporters, according to conservative Sen. Larry Craig (R., Utah).
Mr. Reid's proposal differs from Mr. Simon's by exempting Social Security from possible budget cuts, providing an exception for unbalanced budgets during economic recessions, and permitting borrowing to finance "infrastructure" improvements, among other things.
Sen. Craig criticized Mr. Reid's proposal as merely a "fig leaf," but other Simon allies predicted privately the Democrats' strategy will work.
Still, Mr. Simon held out hope that a weekend of constituent pressure may yet bring enough wavering senators around.
"It is still very, very close," the Illinois Democrat said.
Votes on both proposals have been scheduled for Tuesday.
