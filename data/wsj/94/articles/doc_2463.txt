John F. Akers received upward of $7.5 million when he left International Business Machines Corp. last year, including an early retirement incentive, a special award of almost $1 million, new stock options and previously accumulated stock awards.
IBM's 1994 proxy statement, released yesterday, shows it gave its departing chairman and chief executive officer $2.5 million as part of an early retirement incentive program.
Moreover, the board awarded Mr. Akers an additional $925,000, equal to a year's salary, "in recognition of 33 years of service to the company," the proxy statement said.
Also, upon his unexpectedly early retirement, Mr. Akers received stock he had accumulated in his long tenure with the company: 54,431 shares of restricted stock and 4,281 restricted stock units, valued at nearly $3 million.
In addition, Mr. Akers received a salary of $308,333 for his four months of work last year and a bonus of $125,000, the statement said.
He also received new stock options to acquire 97,000 shares, exercisable at $46.31 a share.
IBM stock closed at $56, up 62.5 cents in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
