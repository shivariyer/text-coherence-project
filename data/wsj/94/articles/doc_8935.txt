Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $5 million, or 18 cents a share, reversing a year-earlier loss but disappointing Wall Street.
In the year-earlier period, the maker of wireless communications equipment posted a net loss of $1.6 million, or eight cents a share.
However, the company saw demand for its products rise sharply, as revenue climbed 79% to $53.7 million in the latest period, ended Dec. 26, 1993, from $30 million in the 1992 fourth quarter.
The company had been expected to earn 25 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research.
The lower per-share results led to a sell-off of the stock.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Qualcomm's shares closed yesterday at $51, down $3.125, or 5.8%.
