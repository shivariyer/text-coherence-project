Shawmut National Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire West Newton Savings Bank of West Newton, Mass., for $45.4 million, or $25 a share.
Shawmut, a bank holding company based in Boston and Hartford, Conn., said the deal is subject to "upward adjustment in certain circumstances" if it isn't completed by Sept. 30.
The transaction is subject to approval by West Newton stockholders and various regulatory agencies and is expected to be completed by Sept. 30.
Upon completion of the transaction, West Newton Savings Bank will become part of Shawmut Bank.
In connection with the agreement, West Newton has granted Shawmut an option, exercisable under certain circumstances, to acquire 19.9% of West Newton's then-outstanding common stock at $21 a share.
West Newton's shares jumped $4.125, or 22%, to close at $22.875 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Shawmut National closed unchanged at $20.125.
Shawmut has been on a buying spree lately; the West Newton Savings Bank deal marks the bank holding company's sixth announced acquisition of other banks or bank branches in the last year.
All of the deals, however, require regulatory approval, which may not prove so easy.
The Federal Reserve Board denied Shawmut's application to acquire New Dartmouth Bank in Manchester, N.H., last November, citing questions about Shawmut's minority-lending record.
On Monday, the Fed said it needs more time to decide whether to reconsider its decision.
