Paxar Corp. said it formed an alliance with Sensormatic Electronics Corp. to apply anti-theft labels and tags to apparel and other soft goods before they leave the manufacturing plant.
By sewing the anti-theft labels into merchandise, retailers can save time and labor costs of attaching the tags to merchandise at stores.
Paxar, which makes fabric labels and tags for retail and apparel markets, said the company would incorporate the anti-theft tags into the labels it already makes.
The Pearl River, N.Y., company expects the program to increase sales by about $1 million this year.
Sensormatic, Deerfield Beach, Fla., supplies electronic security systems to retail, commercial and industrial markets.
The agreement with Paxar represents the introduction of its Universal Product Protection program to the soft goods industry.
Last month, it said Home Depot Inc. began a source tagging program to put the anti-theft labels onto merchandise when it is made or distributed.
