Aldrich Ames, the Central Intelligence Agency officer accused of being a spy for the Russians, failed polygraph tests administered by the agency, an expert on the intelligence community asserted.
Ronald Kessler, author of books about the CIA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, wrote in an op-ed article in the New York Times yesterday that Mr. Ames "failed all three tests the CIA gave him after he allegedly began spying in 1985."
Spokesmen for the CIA and FBI declined to comment.
Rep. Dave McCurdy (D., Okla.), a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the CIA might easily have erred.
"From what I've seen of the handling of this case, it would just be one more piece of incompetence," he said.
A former CIA officer disputed Mr. Kessler's account, which he argued reflects "the FBI line" that the bureau would have cracked the Ames case sooner if the CIA hadn't interfered.
This person said the FBI was given access to the second Ames polygraph, administered in 1991, and didn't raise any alarms at that time.
Another CIA alumnus said the CIA tends to take a hard line in interpreting results of polygraph tests given to applicants, but gives veterans such as Mr. Ames the benefit of the doubt.
