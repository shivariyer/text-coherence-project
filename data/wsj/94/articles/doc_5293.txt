The Texas Economic Index, a weekly leading indicator, remained flat at 111.5 in the latest week, as both initial unemployment claims and Texas refinery output showed little change.
Continuing a recent trend, the year-over-year growth rate in the index rose to 3.0% from 2.94% in the prior week.
That brings the growth rate to the highest level since the middle of December.
Note: All figures are statewide, except for the U.S. Short Leading Index, which is national, and the Consumer Confidence Index, which tracks Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas
