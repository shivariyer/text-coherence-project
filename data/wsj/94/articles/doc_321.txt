A Cambridge, Mass., city councilman and real estate developer was convicted of a fraud scheme that cost Dime Savings Bank of New York $1.2 million.
William H. Walsh, 49 years old, was found guilty in U.S. District Court here of conspiracy, 29 counts of bank fraud and 11 counts of making false statements to the bank in connection with loans granted in 1986 and 1987.
He was found not guilty of 18 other counts of making false statements.
The verdict, delivered by a jury on Monday, followed a 21-day trial and five days of deliberation.
Mr. Walsh was accused of defrauding Dime Savings by obtaining condominium mortgages through submission of false loan documents.
Many of the mortgage holders later defaulted, resulting in losses for the bank.
Mr. Walsh could not be reached for comment.
He told the Boston Globe that he probably will appeal and that he has no immediate plans to quit the Cambridge City Council, where he is a champion of local property owners who oppose the city's rent control law.
Mr. Walsh faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the 41 charges.
Sentencing is scheduled for June 23.
