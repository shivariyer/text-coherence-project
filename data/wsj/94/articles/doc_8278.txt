B.A.TT Industries PLC said it will reorganize its U.S. tobacco subsidiary, Brown & Williamson, resulting in a charge against 1993 earnings of approximately #45 million ($67.4 million).
Brown & Williamson will cut 700 of its current 5,300 jobs in the U.S., a B.A.TT spokesman said.
The cuts will include a 25% decline in sales staff and a 20% reduction of administrative staff at its Louisville, Ky., headquarters.
B.A.TT said the company was "coming up with a very radical incentive program for the sales staff" that focused more on getting the products to the customers rather than merely to the stores.
The spokesman wouldn't elaborate.
The reorganization, which the company expects to complete by late spring, only affects U.S. tobacco sales, the spokesman said.
In the U.S., Brown & Williamson sells several major cigarette brands, including Kool, Capri and Viceroy.
Internationally, it also sells Kent and Lucky Strike.
