Alias Research Inc. said in Toronto that it is being formally investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Alias disclosed in November 1992 that an informal SEC investigation was under way.
Now the probe has been made formal, which allows the SEC to subpoena parties involved in the case, Alias said.
It said the investigation is being conducted privately.
The software design concern said the SEC's formal order confirmed what the company had believed was the focus of the investigation.
It said the focus is the company's public disclosures during and related to its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 1992, and the "underlying financial records and results for this period."
The probe also focuses on trading in Alias securities by certain former officers and directors during 1991, the company said.
It didn't elaborate.
Alias said it has been cooperating fully with the SEC.
