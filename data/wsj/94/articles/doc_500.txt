Daewoo Motor Co., South Korea's third largest auto maker, said it developed a prototype electric automobile.
The company succeeded in the development by equipping its Leman-Van car model with 22 rechargeable batteries, said a Daewoo official.
With this development, Daewoo becomes the third Korean auto company to develop an electric car, following Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp.
The electric car can run a distance of up to 150 kms (93 miles) at speeds of up to 140 kms per hour without recharging.
The development was meant to satisfy requirements by advanced countries for a certain ratio of pollution-free cars to be sold in their countries from 1998, the official said.
He expects Daewoo's commercialization of the prototype electric car to be completed by 1996.
