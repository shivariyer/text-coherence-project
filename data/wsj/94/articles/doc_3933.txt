HarperCollins Publishers, a unit of News Corp., announced a CD-ROM dictionary of sign language for the deaf, the first in a new line of multimedia products.
"A visual dictionary of a visual language belongs in a visual medium," said Nancy Dickenson, head of new media for consumer and reference publishing at HarperCollins.
The company has been publishing the American Sign Language Dictionary in book form for 13 years, and Ms. Dickenson said she thought it was an ideal choice for launching the company's new interactive line.
With a suggested price of $59.95, the CD-ROM will be $10 cheaper than the unabridged, hardcover edition of the same dictionary.
On the CD-ROM, each of 2,500 signs is shown in a video demonstration that also explains the derivation of each sign.
Also, a user can type in a word in four languages other than English and be shown the appropriate sign.
And the product has a memory, so it can remember what signs a person has viewed in a given session and test them on those signs.
The electronic dictionary will be shipped to bookstores in September, said Ms. Dickenson, who declined to estimate potential sales.
She said HarperInteractive, the new electronic line, is developing other titles and expects to release about 15 products in 1995.
