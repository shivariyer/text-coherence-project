Citizens First Bancorp said federal regulators have ended certain capital level requirements and restrictions.
The restrictions were imposed in 1990 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency until the bank holding company improved its capital ratios and overall financial conditions.
The company's principal holding is Citizens First National Bank of New Jersey.
