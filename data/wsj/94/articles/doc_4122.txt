President Clinton nominated John Deutch, currently the Pentagon's acquisition chief, to be deputy secretary of defense.
The move had been expected.
If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Deutch, a former chemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, would succeed William Perry, who became defense secretary this month.
Like Mr. Perry, the 55-year-old Mr. Deutch has a technocratic background.
But Pentagon insiders say that while Mr. Perry is soft-spoken, Mr. Deutch can be heavy-handed and even arrogant.
Mr. Deutch's most notable action thus far at the Pentagon has been his effort to fix the troubled C-17 military cargo jet program.
Saying he was putting the plane's maker, McDonnell Douglas Corp., on "heavy probation," Mr. Deutch vowed in December to terminate the program at 40 aircraft if the company fails to meet delivery schedules, quality goals and cost targets.
Mr. Deutch may push the military for a more liberal interpretation of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy allowing gays in the military.
While provost of MIT in 1990, Mr. Deutch urged the Defense Department to allow gay students to enroll in the ROTC.
