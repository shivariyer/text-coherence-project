What's love got to do with it, anyway?
For lawyers in Dallas, you might have to wonder.
Last week, the Dallas Bar Association issued a news release promoting its LegalLine service, which allows callers to talk -- free of charge -- to lawyers for generic legal assistance.
The February LegalLine special, according to the bar association, will be divorce, custody and family-law topics.
In celebration of Valentine's Day.
This is no "lawyer joke": The bar association says broken hearts are no laughing matter.
"Family law is the No. 1 area of the law for questions, and this was a way to highlight family law," says Dawn Carbone, spokeswoman for all the romantics at the bar association.
"Truthfully, we're just trying to make it more visible."
The group started its LegalLine last June, and receives about 100 calls a month.
It has offered help with labor law for Labor Day and consumer law for Christmas.
"We're just trying to come up with new ways to keep it before the public," Ms. Carbone says.
