United Technologies Corp. may sell some of its small defense businesses in the face of a shrinking U.S. defense industry, Chairman Robert F. Daniell said.
At a news conference in New York, he said the timing of the sales "will be purely opportunistic."
These businesses include United Technologies's Norden unit, which makes radars, and others that make solid rockets, and propellants for the space shuttle.
The Hartford, Conn., company recently announced plans to spin off its automotive division by issuing a separate class of stock, a move that would help it raise gross proceeds of $791 million to $830 million.
The company intends to use the money to reduce debt, increase its dividend and expand core businesses.
Mr. Daniell said the company's financial position "looks rather favorable going forward."
He said the company's focus now would shift to creating growth through expansions of its markets abroad and through acquisitions.
Another executive of the company said the company's Otis unit, which makes elevators, "is a willing buyer" looking for acquisitions.
United Technologies' other businesses include the Pratt & Whitney jet-engine unit and Carrier Corp., a heating and air conditioning business.
