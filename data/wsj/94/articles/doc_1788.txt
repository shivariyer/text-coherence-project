Mellon Bank Corp. said it signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell part of its Boston-based mutual fund administration business to First Data Corp.
Mellon, which said it expects any gain or loss to be immaterial, doesn't expect the sale to be material to its 1994 earnings.
The business being sold provides administrative services to 24 mutual fund families through Boston Co., which Mellon acquired in May 1993.
