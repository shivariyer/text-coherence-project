A consortium of oil companies is close to signing an agreement with Azerbaijan for the $7 billion development and exploitation of two offshore oil fields in the Caspian Sea, according to industry officials.
Following months of give and take on the terms, lawyers are drafting the final language of the accord, expected to be ready for signature within weeks.
Vahit Kuzuoglu, deputy manager of Turkish Petroleum Co., one of the members of the consortium, expects a public statement to be made when Azeri President Geidar Aliyev visits Ankara next month.
"It's long pending," he said.
Oil companies caution, however, that the tedious negotiating process could again be stalled by political turmoil in the former Soviet republic, and over the issue of whether Russia will end up with a stake in the project.
A spokesman for British Petroleum PLC, a leading consortium member, would say only that "we hope to seal an agreement sometime this year."
Other members include Norway's Statoil A/S, Amoco Corp., Pennzoil Co., Ramco Oil Services Inc., Unocal Corp. and McDermott International Inc.
