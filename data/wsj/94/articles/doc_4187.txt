RAM Mobile Data signed an agreement with Davidge Data Systems Corp. to provide a service that would enable brokers to execute orders with laptop computers over a wireless network.
Davidge, which operates a data-communications network for trading orders for brokerage houses, said the wireless transfer of the data would be an alternative to expensive leased lines.
New York-based Davidge said it will make the wireless service available for $400 a month, while a leased line can cost as much as $1,000 in some areas of the country.
Davidge said the wireless system will allow brokers to place or execute orders from areas outside the office, like hotels.
The user would require a laptop or notebook computer and a radio modem, Davidge said.
Ram Mobile Data, a business venture between BellSouth Corp., Atlanta, and RAM Broadcasting Corp., New York, operates wireless networks for the transfer of data in more than 6,300 U.S. cities.
