Veryfine Products Inc. said it bought Balsams Spring Water Co., a Dixville Notch, N.H., bottling company.
Terms weren't disclosed.
In a news release, Veryfine said Balsams Spring will initially operate as a Veryfine unit and will retain the Balsams Spring brand name.
The Balsams line is distributed in New England through grocery and drugstore chains.
Veryfine said the move allows it to broaden its product line and use its existing relationships to widely distribute Balsams products.
Veryfine, of Westford, Mass., makes and distributes juice, juice cocktails, iced teas, lemonades and other soft drinks.
