Tetra Technologies Inc. said it will pay $8.5 million to a unit of Baker Hughes Inc. for the remaining 50% interest in a joint venture.
The acquisition should close by May 24, bringing Tetra Technologies' total interest in the venture to 100%, the company said.
Tetra Technologies, a chemical company based in The Woodlands, Texas, said the joint venture with Baker Hughes's Inteq unit was formed in May 1991 to sell and market clear brine fluids and related products outside the continental U.S.
Tetra Technologies said it will align itself with Inteq through strategic alliance agreements to continue to offer the same services and products formerly offered by the joint venture.
