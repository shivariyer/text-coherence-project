Andre Rousselet, chairman of French pay-TV company Canal Plus SA, resigned from the board of Havas SA, citing displeasure with its decision to group its 24% stake in Canal Plus with the 20% held by Cie. Generale des Eaux, a cable operator.
Canal Plus said Mr. Rousselet is in "total disagreement" with the Havas board's decisions with respect to Canal Plus.
On Thursday, Mr. Rousselet walked out of a Havas board meeting in protest.
The combining of stakes is part of a Havas strategy to forge a strong French multimedia alliance.
Havas Chairman Pierre Dauzier seeks to combine his company's expertise in advertising, TV and publishing with the elements of interactive technology the new partners control.
Programming from Canal Plus, a big player in film and TV production, would play a key role.
Havas and Generale des Eaux are combining their respective Canal Plus stakes in a joint holding.
Societe Generale, the French retail bank that owns 5.1% of Canal Plus, has agreed to act in concert with Havas and Generale des Eaux.
People close to the companies involved suggested that Mr. Rousselet's resignation could lead to his resignation soon from the chairman's post at Canal Plus.
Meanwhile, state-owned France Telecom agreed to hand over its half of a joint telephone directory-publishing venture, Office d'Annonces SA, in exchange for an unspecified stake in Havas.
Analysts estimate France Telecom will get about 5%.
On Friday, Havas estimated that 1993 net income fell 14%, to 705 million francs ($118.5 million) from a year-earlier 823 million francs.
