Peoples Natural Gas Co. said it will file with state regulators for a 5.9% rate increase on April 1, primarily to cover the increasing cost of purchasing gas supplies.
If the request is approved, the rates probably would become effective Oct. 1, 1994, the natural gas utility said.
The new rate would boost bills for average residential customers about $4.60 a month, according to the company, a unit of Consolidated Natural Gas Co.
