MasterCard International Inc. said H. Eugene Lockhart, a British banker-turned-consultant, has been named president and chief executive of the credit-card consortium.
Mr. Lockhart, 43 years old, succeeds Alex Hart, who resigned last week to join fast-growing Advanta Corp.
Mr. Lockhart joins the consortium from First Manhattan Consulting Group, one of the top bank-consulting firms in the U.S., where he was an executive vice president specializing in retail banking and creditcard strategies.
Mr. Lockhart has been an adviser to MasterCard over the past year and a board member since 1990.
Prior to First Manhattan, Mr. Lockhart spent six years at Midland Bank PLC, including the post of chief executive for United Kingdom banking operations.
He had responsibility for all domestic banking, including credit and debit cards and retail banking.
Midland is the U.K.'s thirdlargest credit-card issuer.
Mr. Lockhart takes the helm at a time of cutthroat competition between MasterCard and its larger rival, Visa U.S.A., for new markets.
While MasterCard has gained on its rival domestically, it still lags behind on a global basis.
With consumers in the U.S. flush with credit cards, both companies are pushing into the corporate credit-card market as well as so-called debit cards.
"In Gene, we saw someone who had an unusual combination of line retail banking experience as well as experience in international consumer payments and technology," said Norman J. Tice, chairman of MasterCard's board and executive vice president of Boatmen's National Bank of St. Louis.
