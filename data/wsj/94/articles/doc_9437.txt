Scattered strength lifted small-company stocks to new records in a topsy-turvy session.
"It looked pretty much like a tug of war between buyers and sellers," said Jim Thomas, vice president of equity trading at Davenport & Co.
"I didn't see anyone real aggressive here."
But smaller stocks remained so close to their records that only a slight shove was needed to take them past previous all-time highs.

The Nasdaq Composite Index surpassed its record in the morning but gave way to some light profit-taking and was unable to maintain a grip on record territory.
The index edged up 1.35 points, or 0.17%, to end at 786.87, about half a point short of its all-time high.
Both the Russell and the Nasdaq Composite flirted with their records all day.
