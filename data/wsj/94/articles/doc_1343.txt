Canada will provide humanitarian assistance to Cuba and will encourage the U.S. to do likewise, Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet said.
Mr. Ouellet said that for the time being, Canada's assistance to Cuba will be channeled through nongovernmental organizations.
But he said the Canadian government is also reviewing the possibility of resuming direct aid to Cuba.
Mr. Ouellet said Canadians "can't stay idle" in face of the basic needs of Cuba's population.
He said he hoped the U.S. will "turn the page" with regard to Cuba as it has done with Vietnam.
The minister said that Canada is opposed to the trade embargo of Cuba and that he believes "every effort" should be made to re-establish Cuba's relations with other nations in the hemisphere.
