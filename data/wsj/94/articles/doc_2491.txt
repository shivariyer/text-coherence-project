The House Education and Labor Committee approved a bill that would force companies with 11 or more employees to set up worker-management safety teams to prevent injuries in the workplace.
The bill, approved 26-17, also would increase potential criminal and civil penalties against employers and managers in cases of safety violations that result in serious injury or death.
Under the legislation, government safety inspectors could close down an unsafe operation immediately without a court order.
The Clinton administration and organized labor strongly back the plan, which would mark the first major changes to the 20-year-old Occupational Health and Safety Act.
The committee vote was along party lines, except for two Democrats who voted against the legislation.
Republicans, with strong urging from the business community, vehemently oppose the bill's mandated team approach.
"This bill will not improve safety and health, but it will impose huge new mandates on American employers," said Rep. William Goodling of Pennsylvania, the committee's ranking Republican.
