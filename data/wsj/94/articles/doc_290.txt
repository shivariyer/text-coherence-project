Sales at Japan's major department stores and supermarkets in February were down 2.8% to 1.452 trillion yen ($13.9 billion) from a year earlier, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry reported.
The decline was the 21st consecutive monthly drop in Japanese retail sales.
The February decline was steeper than the 2.5% drop in January but was flatter than the 4.7% drop in December 1993.
The persistent drop in retail sales illustrates the continued weakness in personal consumption, which accounts for nearly 60% of Japan's domestic output.
