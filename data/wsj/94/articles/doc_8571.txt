C.R. Bard Inc., on its way to resolving remaining Food and Drug Administration sanctions stemming from problems with its heart-surgery instruments, said the FDA wants new internal audits of certain medical-product applications.
Only after the internal review will the FDA consider the pending approvals of products made by Bard's USCI division, the company said.
The USCI division makes the balloon angioplasty devices -- wires with balloon-like tops used to open clogged arteries.
Bard agreed in October to pay $61 million to settle criminal charges related to the sale of defective heart catheters.
Among other allegations, Bard was charged with making false statements to regulators about the safety of its products.
Bard's chief financial officer, William C. Bopp, said the company must ensure that information in USCI's applications accurately reflects the company's data.
The audit will apply to several balloon-angioplasty catheters and related products and should take less than 60 days, he said.
The delay, he added, shouldn't materially affect the company's earnings this year or next.
Noting that the FDA approved two new Bard heart catheters this month, analysts Frederick A. Wise of Bear Stearns & Co. and David Lothson of PaineWebber Co. agreed that the latest action shouldn't significantly hurt the company's outlook.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Bard's shares closed at $29.50, off 87.5 cents.
