Danaher Corp. apparently outbid Crane Co. and other rivals to acquire Mark Controls Corp., a maker of industrial valves based in Skokie, Ill.
Danaher said Mark's board had endorsed its tender offer of $17.75 a share, or about $89 million, for all the shares outstanding.
But Mark's shares traded even higher for a time yesterday, and closed up $2, at $17.875, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
This week, Crane had sweetened its offer to buy Mark to $15.50 a share, or about $78 million.
Crane had no comment yesterday on Danaher's bid.
Danaher, which had 1993 revenue of $1.1 billion, said its offer is conditioned on the tender of 80% of Mark's fully diluted shares.
As part of its proposed acquisition, Danaher will also assume about $38 million of debt.
Mark had 1993 revenue of $88 million.
On a pro forma basis, the company's revenue would have been about $125 million.
