I appreciate the Jan. 6 page-one article on reverse immigration of Latvians.
Your delineations of experiences by returning exiles have some credibility since my visits to Latvia easily led to similar conclusions.
But you whitewash the Soviet Russian atrocities of 1940 in Latvia by dismissing the Russian occupation altogether.
In 1940 Latvia was invaded by the Soviet Union, not the Nazis.
The Nazis followed in 1941, when the consequences of the Soviet occupation came to light.
Some 35,000 Latvians had been deported to unknown destinations east of the Urals; an unknown number of tortured and murdered Latvians turned up in mass graves and dungeons of Cheka prisons.
This was the principal reason for the flight to the West.
The odd twist in Latvian history is that the Nazi invasion of Russia, for reasons other than saving the Latvians from extinction, interrupted the Soviet commitment to genocide.
Had the Nazi invasion of Russia not occurred, or occurred a few weeks later, neither the reverse immigrants, nor I, would exist, for their parents and mine would have ended their lives in the gulags.
