A Chinese facsimile-machine joint venture of Ricoh Co., a major Japanese maker of office automation equipment, will begin local procurement of parts in 1995 and increase local content to 80% by 1996.
Shanghai Ricoh Facsimile Co. started assembly of facsimile machines in February, with all machinery parts shipped from Japan.
The plan for parts procurement in China is aimed at cutting costs.
The company hopes to secure export of low-priced facsimile machines world-wide, a Ricoh spokesman said.
Ricoh holds a 49.5% stake in the joint venture, while government-run Shanghai Facsimile Machine Co., China's top facsimile equipment maker, owns 45%.
Champion Technology Ltd. of Hong Kong holds the remaining equity.
