Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to announce soon the name of the special counsel who will examine matters surrounding President Clinton's investment in Whitewater Development Corp.
A Justice Department official said the announcement may come as early as today, "but that would be quite a push."
Ms. Reno was traveling between Friday and last night and planned to review names upon her return.
While she was away, a small group of department employees, including Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann and criminal-division chief Jo Ann Harris, have been contacting lawyers to see whether they would be available for the post.
Among those under consideration are Dan Webb, a former U.S. attorney who was a deputy independent counsel during the Iran-Contra probe, and former U.S. Attorney Robert Fisk.
