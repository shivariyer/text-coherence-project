Huntington National Bank unveiled what some might consider the Rolls-Royce of ATM machines.
The bank's new Personal Touch video banking machine allows customers to sit down in a cubicle and talk to a banker on a video screen, any time of day or night, seven days a week.
The machines, developed in cooperation with AT&T Global Information Systems, allow customers to carry out nearly any transaction performed in a banking office -- such as opening accounts, checking on account balances, or getting a loan for a car or boat.
Huntington is the first bank in North America to offer such a service.
At least one bank in Britain offers a similar machine.
"We're convinced customers want to be able to bank from their point of convenience -- any time of day or night," says Cynthia Phillips, a bank spokeswoman.
The bank has opened two locations, one in Columbus and one in Dayton.
But the bank plans to study the technology carefully before it commits to any major expansions in the program.
Ms. Phillips says the company will examine such issues as customer preferences; for instance, identifying the places where customers most want to have the machines located.
The units are built with a frosted glass cubicle, to enhance security, and have a separate ATM machine, for customers who only want to make quick withdrawals or deposits.
Huntington Bancshares Inc., the holding company, is an $18 billion regional bank based in Columbus.
The company's banking subsidiaries operate 352 offices in eight states.
