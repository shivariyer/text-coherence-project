Mexican construction giant Empresas ICA S.A., Mexico City, said it intends to sell its hotel division as part of its corporate strategy to focus on its core construction business.
ICA controls five Sheraton hotels in the resort destinations of Cancun, Huatulco, Acapulco, Ixtapa and Puerto Vallarta.
It also controls the Radisson chain of hotels in Mexico.
ICA has named Baring Brothers & Co. as financial adviser for the sale.
ICA owns and operates Sheraton hotels in association with Sheraton International and American Express Co.
ICA and Banco Nacional de Mexico S.A. own and operate the Radisson hotels in Mexico through a franchise agreement with Carlson Hospitality Group Inc.
It wasn't immediately clear if ICA intends to sell all or part of these properties.
ICA's hotel division contributed 257 million new pesos ($79 million) to total 1992 revenue of 5.59 billion new pesos ($1.7 billion).
That's equivalant to about 4.6% of total revenue.
The division has an interest in 4,262 hotel rooms and had a 1992 occupancy rate of 65.4%.
