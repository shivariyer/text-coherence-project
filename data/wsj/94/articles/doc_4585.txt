Westvaco Corp., hurt by continuing intense competition in the paper industry, reported sharply lower fiscal first-quarter earnings.
The New York-based paper, packaging and chemicals company said net income for the quarter ended Jan. 31 totaled $15.8 million, or 24 cents a share.
In the 1993 quarter, earnings were restated to $76.1 million, or $1.14 a share, because of the adoption last August of new accounting requirements.
Without the accounting change, net was $20.9 million, or 31 cents a share.
Revenue edged up 2.9%, to $577.3 million from $561.1 million.
Westvaco said that while volume sales rose 6% in the quarter, earnings were dragged down by a 3% decline in prices for its mix of products.
