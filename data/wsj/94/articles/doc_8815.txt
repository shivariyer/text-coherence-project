Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company preparing for privatization, reported that estimated net income plunged in 1993 to 1.1 billion French francs ($185.2 million) from 6.2 billion francs a year earlier.
Sales edged up to 210 billion francs, from 200.6 billion francs.
Analysts weren't surprised -- Elf Chairman Philippe Jaffre had prepared them last November, when the company had disclosed that 1993 net income wouldn't be much over one billion francs -- and some said the results were a shade better than they had expected.
The Elf chairman earlier had indicated that nonrecurring charges for 1993 would amount to about 2.2 billion francs.
Yesterday, Elf said these charges totaled two billion francs.
Mr. Jaffre has scheduled a news conference for tomorrow and analysts said investor meetings have been called for next week, suggesting that details of the government's planned sale of much of its 51% interest in Elf may be announced.
