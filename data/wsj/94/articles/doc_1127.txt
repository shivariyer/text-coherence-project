USAir Group said it is restarting its pre-summer fare-reduction program.
The program reduces air fares for travel between the East and Florida to $198 round trip; and to $298 round trip for flights between the East and New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin.
The new rates also cut the round-trip fare between the East and West Coast to $398.
The rates apply to travel between April 19 and June 15.
The offer resumes a round of fare reductions initiated March 4 by Northwest Airlines, which expired March 11.
Tickets under the new offer must be purchased by March 31.
Yesterday, most major airlines, including Continental Airlines and AMR Corp's.
American Airlines, matched the fare cuts in competing markets.
