Dean Witter, Discover & Co., one of last year's hottest initial public stock offerings, has enriched investors.
Now the company is spreading the good cheer with its chairman.
Dean Witter Discover, parent of brokerage firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and the Discover credit card, paid Chairman Philip Purcell a 1993 pay package of $6.7 million, according to its proxy.
That's double the $3.3 million Mr. Purcell was paid in 1992, when the company was a unit of giant Sears, Roebuck & Co.
Mr. Purcell, 50 years old, received a 1993 bonus of $2.5 million, up 56% from the $1.6 million bonus he received in 1992.
His salary was unchanged, at $650,000.
As part of his pay package, Mr. Purcell also received $1.6 million in stock awards and $2 million from a long-term performance plan.
"Other" compensation totaled an additional $3,739.
Though Mr. Purcell's 1993 pay is a record for Dean Witter, it lags behind last year's compensation of chairmen at Bear Stearns Cos., Merrill Lynch & Co. and PaineWebber Group Inc.
Dean Witter had record earnings last year amid strong trading by individual investors and a surge in new stock and bond offerings -- including the company's own $800 million IPO in February.
Dean Witter's stock has soared 33% since then, far out-distancing the gains in major stock indexes.
Its shares closed yesterday at $36, down 62.5 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
