K-III Communications Corp. named Kurt Andersen , Time magazine editor at large, to be editor of the company's New York Magazine.
Mr. Andersen, 39 years old, replaces Edward Kosner, who left in September to become editor in chief of Hearst Corp.'s Esquire.
Mr. Andersen, who writes a column for Time on media and culture and who engineered the recent redesign of the weekly newsmagazine's Chronicle section, was a co-founder of Spy Magazine, which he edited from 1986 to 1992.
K-III's top magazine executive, Harry McQuillen, described the 25-year-old magazine as "in good shape," adding that "Kurt agrees that we need evolutionary change rather than radical redesign."
The finalists in K-III's search for an editor included Michael Kinsley, co-host of CNN's "Crossfire" and former editor of the New Republic magazine, and Peter Herbst, a veteran New York Magazine staffer who has been acting editor.
K-III Communications is a publishing concern funded and partly owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
