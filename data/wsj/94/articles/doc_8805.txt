CF Income Partners L.P. said it signed a definitive agreement to sell the assets of the partnership to an affiliate of JMB Realty Corp., Chicago, and Apollo Real Estate Advisors L.P., New York, in a transaction that after certain adjustments is valued at $166.5 million.
The troubled partnership, whose investment real estate includes shopping centers and apartment buildings, said in November that a $182.5 million pact to sell most of its assets to American Continental Properties Group had fallen through.
CF Income Partners, based in Los Angeles, said it plans to dissolve the partnership and distribute a total of about $13.2 million, or $1 a unit, to unit holders if the deal is completed.
Completion of the deal is subject to conditions including approval by unit holders and settlement of litigation.
