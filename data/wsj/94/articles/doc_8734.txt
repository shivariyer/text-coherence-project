Crane Co., a maker of industrial products for the aerospace and construction industries, said it wants to acquire Illinois-based Mark Controls Corp. for about $56.6 million.
Crane, which two weeks ago disclosed a 13.2% stake in Mark Controls, said it plans to meet with management of the valve and instrument control maker to discuss a possible $13-a-share cash offer for the shares it doesn't already own.
Mark Controls has a little more than five million shares outstanding.
Crane's offer is 35% higher than a bid from an investor group rejected by Mark Controls last spring and 46% higher than its stock price before Crane announced its initial stake.
News of the merger offer helped push Mark Control's stock up $2.625 a share to $13.875, up 23%, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading on more than 10 times average volume.
Two weeks ago, William E. Bendix, president and chief executive officer of Mark Controls, said the Skokie, Ill., industrial valve manufacturer was not for sale.
But yesterday Mr. Bendix said he spoke briefly with Crane's chairman and CEO, Robert S. Evans, and scheduled a meeting with Crane executives for next Wednesday, two days before Mark Control's regularly scheduled board meeting next Friday.
Crane said that it may be willing to increase its price, if a higher bid is justified by Mark Control's business plan and other confidential information.
Mr. Bendix said the company hasn't yet decided whether to give Crane access to the confidential information it requested.
In 1992, Mark Controls had net income of $3.7 million, or 73 cents a share, on sales of $86.2 million.
Crane had 1992 profit of $24.3 million, or 79 cents a share, including a nonrecurring charge of $39.4 million.
Its sales were $1.3 billion.
