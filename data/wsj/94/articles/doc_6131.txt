The Texas Economic Index, a weekly leading indicator, rose slightly to 111.5 from 111.2 in the year-earlier period, as a dip in initial unemployment claims overshadowed a slight drop in Texas refinery output.
Continuing a recent trend, the year-over-year growth rate in the index rose to 2.94% in the latest week from 2.84% in the prior week.
Note: All figures are statewide, except for the U.S. Short Leading Index, which is national, and the Consumer Confidence Index, which tracks Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas
