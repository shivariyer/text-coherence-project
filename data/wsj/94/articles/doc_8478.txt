Silicon Graphics Inc., benefiting from sales of its new Indy graphics workstations, said fiscal second-quarter net income surged 65% on a 37% increase in revenue.
Net in the period ended Dec. 31 rose to $36.3 million, or 24 cents a share, from $22 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $370.4 million from $270.2 million a year earlier.
The results beat analysts' expectations of about 20 cents a share.
The Mountain View, Calif., workstation maker also beat its own goals, with 13.6% operating margins for the quarter, up from 10.9% a year earlier; it had hoped the margins would be 11% to 13%.
Salomon Brothers analyst Jeff Canin said the improvement was driven by higher sales as the company kept costs flat.
"The second quarter was nothing short of outstanding," he said.
Silicon's stock rose 75 cents, or 3.4%, to close at $23.125 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
