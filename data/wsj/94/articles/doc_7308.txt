Solitec Inc., blaming a shortage of cash, said it dismissed dozens of employees at its head office and its Compumart subsidiary in Portland, Ore.
The company, which makes chip production equipment and distributes electronics goods, also said that Joe McDowell, its chief executive officer, cut his salary to the federal minimum hourly wage and that Partha Sarathy, the chief financial officer, had resigned.
To ease its cash crunch, Solitec said that it might seek new investors or sell one or more of its operations.
The company said it was discussing such options with several groups.
