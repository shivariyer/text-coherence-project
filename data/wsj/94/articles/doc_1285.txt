The Texas attorney general's office said it settled a lawsuit against Prudential Insurance Co. of America over claims that the insurer had wrongly refused to cover a bone-marrow transplant treatment for patients with advanced breast cancer.
The attorney general's office said Prudential agreed to cover autologous bone marrow transplants with high-dose chemotherapy to insured patients who meet certain criteria designed to ensure they can tolerate the treatment.
In the lawsuit, filed in a federal district court here in September, Attorney General Dan Morales alleged that Prudential and certain of its subsidiaries had denied payment for the treatment, wrongly claiming that it was experimental and not covered by its policies.
Prudential officials with knowledge of the lawsuit were not immediately available for comment on the settlement.
The Newark, N.J.-based insurer had previously indicated that while it had not denied coverage for all patients, the procedure was still under federal study and not recommended for everyone.
