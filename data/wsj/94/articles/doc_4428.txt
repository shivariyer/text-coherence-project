Gandalf Technologies Inc., which has reported heavy losses and declining sales, said it will eliminate 300 jobs, mainly in North America.
The cutback will reduce Gandalf's work force to 1,000.
The reductions will involve jobs in manufacturing, administration and sales support.
Gandalf, a producer of communications network equipment, has retained Wood Gundy Inc., a Toronto-based investment concern, to explore possible strategic alliances "to accelerate the return to profitability."
Gandalf reported a net loss of $11.08 million on revenue of $99.5 million in the fiscal nine months ended Jan. 1.
