The huge losses of French state-controlled bank Credit Lyonnais in 1993 will force Thomson SA to sell as much as 8% of its shares in its defense and electronics subsidiary Thomson-CSF, a spokesman for Thomson said.
Thomson-CSF has a 21.6% share holding in Credit Lyonnais, and its 1993 earnings will be pushed into the red after it takes into account its share of the bank's loss of 6.9 billion francs ($1.21 billion) in 1993.
Thomson SA currently controls 58.3% of Thomson-CSF, and it's envisaged that this stake should be reduced by an amount that would raise the necessary amount of cash, while allowing Thomson SA to retain control of the arms and electronics group.
Just over 41% of Thomson-CSF's capital is held by the public.
Thomson-CSF's share of the Credit Lyonnais loss is estimated at more than 1.4 billion francs.
