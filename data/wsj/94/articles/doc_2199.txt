CellStar Corp. said it doesn't expect to meet analysts' projections for earnings of $14.8 million to $15.7 million, or 80 cents to 85 cents a share, for its fiscal year ending Nov. 30, 1994.
The company's stock skidded sharply on the news, closing at $12.75 a share, down $4, or 24%, in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday.
CellStar, Dallas, said it based the gloomier outlook on preliminary results for its first quarter ended Feb. 28.
The cellular-telephone concern said that while revenue for the quarter grew about 50%, to just over $90 million, from about $60 million a year earlier, it expects flat earnings.
CellStar, which only recently became publicly held, hasn't released quarterly results for 1993.
The company said it will release those when it reports final operating results for the 1994 first quarter, in early April.
