Stride Rite Corp. said that sales and earnings for the fiscal first quarter ending March 4 will trail year-earlier results because of problems at a new distribution center in Kentucky.
The Cambridge, Mass., shoemaker said sales for the quarter "are expected to be below last year's results," and earnings "are expected to be off" by more than 15%.
It declined to be more specific.
In the year-earlier quarter Stride Rite net income was $15.2 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $140.8 million.
The problems with the Louisville, Ky., facility are ironic, because Stride Rite weathered a storm of controversy last year when it announced its plan to open the plant.
Stride Rite, which had a long history of promoting social responsibility, closed an inner-city distribution center in Boston, firing 175 workers.
In late trading, Stride Rite stock was down 62.5 cents at $15.75.
