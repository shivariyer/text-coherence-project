Dow Jones & Co. launched an Asian corporate financial news service distributed through Dow Jones Telerate, a provider of real-time financial information.
The news service, Dow Jones Asian Equities Report, will concentrate on Asian business and financial news and will cover the region's 12 leading stock markets and news affecting them.
The report, currently available in Asia, is delivered on the Telerate DynaQuote regional equities service and is also available as an optional service on Telerate Matrix, Telerate Workstation and other Telerate services.
These services provide market prices and other financial information.
Dow Jones Asian Equities Report will be available globally at a later date.
In addition to its own staff, Dow Jones Asian Equities Report will use reporters from The Wall Street Journal, The Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review to provide coverage and analysis of Asian companies, markets and industry sectors.
The report will also draw on the resources of AP-Dow Jones, a joint venture of the Associated Press and Dow Jones.
AP-Dow Jones offers several news services world-wide.
Dow Jones, based in New York, publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, the Far Eastern Economic Review, and other periodicals, electronic business information services, including Dow Jones Telerate, and community newspapers.
Along with real-time financial information, Dow Jones Telerate provides financial-analysis tools and transaction services to the international business community.
