In a filing with U.S. bankruptcy court, America West Airlines sought to placate concerns that the Phoenix-based carrier would lose its independence if an investment group that includes Continental Airlines takes control of America West.
America West, which has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for 2 1/2 years, has selected a $220 million bid led by David Bonderman and James Coulter, Fort Worth, Texas, investors who are major shareholders in Continental.
Continental itself is also a minority investor in the America West bid.
In America West's filing, it said the reorganized company under this proposal would have a board whose majority was associated with the investment group, called AmWest Partners L.P., but would also have "significant independent perspective."
America West said no Continental officers would serve on the board.
