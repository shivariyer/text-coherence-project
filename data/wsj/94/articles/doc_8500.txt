The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged to another record amid mixed economic news.
Bond prices rose and the dollar was mixed.
The Dow Jones industrials gained 7.59 points to 3891.96, the year's eighth record.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.68 to 474.98, less than a point from its high.
The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 3.74 to 793.02, eking out a record.
The industrial average hit a high despite some distinctly mixed economic news.
On the positive side, the Commerce Department said housing starts soared 6.2% in December, as 1993's housing starts hit their highest level in four years.
"The December housing numbers were nothing short of spectacular," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany.
But he argued that the more important economic report was the one showing a large increase in initial claims for state unemployment insurance during the week ended Jan. 15.
He noted that the claims data are part of the index of leading indicators and more recent than the housing starts data.
"Claims for unemployment insurance appear to be rising since Dec. 25, suggesting that the economic strength of the fourth-quarter will not carry over into the first-quarter," he said.
"The markets seem to be reflecting that conclusion."
Even though the industrials hit a high, stocks' performance was unconvincing, Mr. Johnson said.
At the same time, bond prices overcame an initial decline on the strong housing starts data and climbed in expectation that a slower economy will forestall an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, he added.
World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index advanced 0.17 to 114.38.
Stock prices rose.
Volume totaled 310.4 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,110 issues rose and 960 fell.
Bond prices climbed.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue gained more than 3/8 point, or over $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.26%.
The dollar was mixed.
In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.7380 marks and 111.40 yen compared, with 1.7460 marks and 111.35 yen Wednesday.
