The Texas Economic Index, a weekly leading indicator, rose to 111.14 in the latest week from 111.08 the prior week.
But the annual growth rate of the Index continued its sharp decline, falling to 2.58% from 2.77% a week earlier.
The year-over-year decline suggests Texas' economic growth rate is falling slightly.
In the latest week, Texas refinery output rose slightly.
Note: All figures are statewide, except for the U.S. Short Leading Index, which is national, and the Consumer Confidence Index, which tracks Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas
