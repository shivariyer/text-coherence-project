Tumbling bond prices sparked a staggering sell-off in the stock market, driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 3700 for the first time since Dec. 1.
The dollar was mixed.
The Dow industrials sank 63.33 points, or 1.68%, to 3699.02.
Waves of selling swamped the market near the close, setting off the New York Stock Exchange "collar."
That system slows computer-aided program trading whenever the industrial average moves up or down 50 points from the previous day's close.
Just since Thursday, the industrial average has shed 122 points, or 3.2%; it is now 7% below its high of 3978.36 set on Jan. 31.
Yesterday's pummeling was especially evident in the nearly 10-to-1 ratio of declining stocks to advancers on the Big Board.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slumped 7.52, or 1.6%, to 452.48, and the Nasdaq Composite Index plummeted 17.21, or 2.2%, to 755.29.
The rout was spurred by a plunge in bond prices after a strong report on consumer confidence.
The Conference Board reported its consumer-sentiment index rose to 86.7 in March from 79.9 in February.
What undermined the bond market was that the trend shows considerable improvement since October.
Even more troubling was that the March level was the highest since July 1990.
The Conference Board also said that the current level of consumer confidence has historically led to an increasingly strong economy.
"Once again we have the fear that the economy isn't going to slow down and that we're only in the foothills of a much stronger tightening in Federal Reserve policy," said Richard B. Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
The drop in bond prices pushed the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue back above 7% after it had slipped below that psychologically important level on Monday.
The long bond tumbled more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount, with the yield rising to 7.06% from 6.87% Monday, hitting its highest level since February 1993.
Stock prices took their cue from bonds.
Even though many analysts believe the fundamentals remain bright for the stock market, investors sold in hordes.
Mr. Berner pointed out that as interest rates rise, the value of stock holdings decline.
"Earnings look good and margins are improving," Mr. Berner said.
"But $1 of earnings is worth less when interest rates are at 7.06% rather than 6.06%."
Stock investors also were discouraged by bearish recommendations from two brokerage firms.
Smith Barney Shearson advised clients to reduce their stock holdings to 50% from 55% of their portfolios.
The nation's second-largest brokerage said the S&P 500 could plunge 11% before the correction is over.
Dean Witter Reynolds told investors to cut their stock holdings to 50% from 60% of their portfolios.
The company also recommended that investors slash their bond-market exposure to 25% from 35% and raise cash levels to 25% from 5%.
Though many signs point to a stronger economy, some analysts see higher interest rates eventually slowing economic growth.
Since stocks often anticipate economic trends, the current steep declines may be evidence of the coming slowdown, said Neil Hokanson, president of Hokanson Financial Management in Encinitas, Calif.
He predicts that the economy will cool next year not only because of the rise in rates but also because of growing government regulation and higher taxes.
Indeed, the stock market yesterday flashed some signs of a possible economic slowdown.
First, economically sensitive stocks suffered some of the steepest losses.
Also, the Dow Jones Transportation Average was one of the hardest hit indexes, tumbling 35.53, or 2.1%, to 1675.36.
The transportation average is often an indicator of future economic activity because its components are the airlines, trucking concerns and railroads that move goods and people around the country.
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index lost 0.96 to 113.46.
Stock prices plunged.
Volume totaled 301.1 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 2,034 issues fell and 280 rose.
Bond prices fell.
The Treasury's 10-year bond lost more than 3/4 point, or more than $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.71%.
The dollar was mixed.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.6735 marks and 103.13 yen compared with 1.6715 marks and 104.05 yen Monday.
