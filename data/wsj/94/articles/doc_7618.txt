Inland Steel Industries Inc. said it reached an agreement with General Electric Capital Corp. to purchase that company's equity interest in the caster facility that its Inland Steel Co. unit now leases from the General Electric Co. unit.
The steel holding company said the interest will be purchased for $83 million, using part of the proceeds received from the company's common stock offering last month.
The caster facility, which the company has leased since 1985, is part of Inland Steel's plant in East Chicago, Ind.
Inland Steel said the purchase "is consistent with the company's overall effort to reduce its fixed charges."
Inland Steel is also the parent of Inland Materials Distribution Group Inc., which operates a steel service center.
