Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. earnings surged 33% to 2.73 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$353.4 million) from HK$2.05 billion in 1993, and the company predicted even bigger profit growth ahead.
"Our profit should almost double in the next two to three years," Chairman Peter Woo said.
He said the earnings surge will come from rental income earned on roughly six million square feet of new property coming on stream this year and next.
The property will bring in about HK$2.5 billion in rental billings a year, he added.
Wharf's revenue surged 43% to HK$6.3 billion in 1993 from HK$4.4 billion a year earlier.
