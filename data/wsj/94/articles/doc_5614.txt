British institutional investors with an interest in venture capital are increasingly managing such investments themselves, because of dissatisfaction with low yields produced by intermediary venture capital companies.
That's the conclusion of a report on the British industry published by Initiative Europe Ltd., a specialist consultancy.
"After a decade of rapid growth, the U.K. venture capital industry is entering adolescence, rather than maturity," the report says.
Outside the U.S., Britain's venture capital industry is one of the world's most developed, so moves here can be useful guides to what may happen in continental Europe.
Though institutional investors can provide a potentially vast pool of capital for the venture capital industry, the report states, many have been discouraged by returns so far.
As a result, rather than investing through outside firms, institutions such as Prudential Corp. and PosTel Investment Management -- the post office and telephone workers' pension fund -- have recently invested substantial sums in directly controlled venture capital operations.
This "trend for institutions to move from fund to direct investment is likely to continue and intensify," Initiative Europe predicts.
Investments in British venture capital funds during the 1980s were based on the promise of returns in excess of 30%.
But these promises were based on erroneous data about U.S. performance and on a handful of early experiences of U.K. buyouts that weren't matched in later years, Initiative Europe says.
In reality, it notes, most major U.K. institutional investors have seen their venture capital investments yield returns of between zero and 10% over the past decade.
