French domestic airline Air Inter said it is suspending operations of its new Airbus A330 jet because of repeated problems with the aircraft's landing gear.
Air Inter is the launch customer for the A330, the latest addition to the Airbus Industrie family of commercial jets.
The A330 is a twin-engine sister of the European consortium's long-range, four-engine A340 commercial jet.
Air Inter, a subsidiary of state-owned Air France, said it would halt A330 operations "until all the problems raised by these events have been completely analyzed and sorted out" by Airbus.
Airbus is a consortium among Aerospatiale of France, Daimler-Benz AG's Deutsche Aerospace-Airbus GmbH of Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.
Air Inter took delivery of its first A330 at the end of last year and put it into service in mid-January on its Paris-Toulouse and Paris-Marseille routes.
The aircraft's landing gear failed to retract after takeoffs on Jan. 18 and 19, and the aircraft was taken out of service for maintenance.
A similar incident occurred on Friday.
The A330 has the same landing gear as the A340, which hasn't experienced such problems.
Air Inter has ordered five A330s to be delivered in the next year.
Overall, Airbus Industrie has booked 118 orders for A330s, from 14 customers.
But only one has been delivered so far.
The next planes scheduled for delivery will also go to Air Inter.
A spokesman for Airbus Industrie said, "Obviously we're going to take a close look at the aircraft in order to get to the bottom of the problem."
He said one difficulty is that the problem is "intermittent" and doesn't occur on each take-off.
Dowty Aerospace of Britain is the prime contractor for the A330's landing gear along with Messier-Bugatti SA of France.
