Texas dropped a lawsuit against McDonald's Corp. after the fast-food chain announced it would make its domestic company-owned restaurants smoke free.
Earlier this month the state's attorney general, Dan Morales, sued Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's, along with Burger King Corp., a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC; PepsiCo Inc.'s Taco Bell and KFC chains, and Long John Silver's Restaurants Inc., seeking action by the restaurants in Texas to reduce second-hand smoke that may harm children and other patrons on the premises.
Mr. Morales called the McDonald's decision to go smoke free "the right thing for the right reasons."
