Morrison Knudsen Corp. said it joined with FINSA Grupo Arguelles of Mexico to form a new company, MK-Finsa, to provide engineering and construction services to automotive, food, aerospace and manufacturing industries in Mexico.
Separately, the company said that Hughes Aircraft Co., the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District of San Francisco and Morrison Knudsen were awarded $19.5 million in defense conversion funds as part of the Clinton administration's technology reinvestment project.
The team will develop an advanced automated train control system to be installed and tested on BART's subway cars, Morrison Knudsen said.
