U.S. Bancorp became the latest bank holding company to mount a cost-cutting campaign, announcing plans to cut its work force by 10%, or about 1,400 employees, and take a $100 million charge against first-quarter earnings.
The company said it will offer early retirement and voluntary severance packages that it expects will meet staff reduction targets over the next six months.
But the company said it may resort to layoffs if necessary.
Because of the charge, U.S. Bancorp said it expects to post a first-quarter net loss of between $15 million and $20 million, or 15 cents to 20 cents a share.
Analysts had been expecting a profit of about 62 cents, the company said.
U.S. Bancorp last fall hired First Manhattan Consultant Group to help analyze its operations and identify efficiency measures.
Gerry Cameron, the banking company's chief executive, said U.S. Bancorp has resolved to cut its expense ratio in three years from 65.7% to 59%, the level of top-performing banks.
"They are trying to catch up with steps that most of their peers have already taken," said Andy Brown, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
"Everybody was looking for Gerry Cameron to do something like this, and I think there will be more actions in the near future."
U.S. Bancorp closed unchanged at $25.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
