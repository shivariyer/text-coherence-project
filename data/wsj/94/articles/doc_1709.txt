Oryx Energy Co., hurt by the plunge in crude-oil prices, said it will cut its work force 20% and sell off certain U.S. assets to reduce annual costs by at least $61 million, or 5% of expenses.
The Dallas oil exploration and production company said it expects to record a first-quarter charge of $103 million for losses on the sale of assets, employee layoffs and postretirement-benefit adjustments.
In the year-earlier quarter, Oryx reported a loss of $7 million, or eight cents a share.
The company's announcement follows Oryx's move two months ago to suspend its quarterly dividend and slash capital spending this year by 20%.
Oryx said estimated production in 1995 will be reduced by 5,000 equivalent barrels a day, or 2% of expected 1994 production.
The company expects to produce 82 million equivalent barrels this year.
