J.M. Smucker Co. said it agreed in principle to acquire the Mrs. Smith's frozen-pie business from Kellogg Co.
Terms weren't disclosed, but Kellogg said it hoped to complete the transaction in about a month.
The acquisition would put Smucker, an Orrville, Ohio, maker of preserves, jellies and fruit juices, into the pie business.
A single production plant, at Pottstown, Pa., is involved.
Analysts estimate Mrs. Smith's pie sales at less than $150 million.
The brand has about a 59% share of the U.S. frozen-pie market.
Smucker Chairman Tim Smucker is a Kellogg director, and the Battle Creek, Mich., cereal company said it took "every action" to ensure there was no conflict of interest in the deal.
A company spokesman said Kellogg had conducted an extended auction process for the business.
