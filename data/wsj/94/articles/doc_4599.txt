James Bovard's Feb. 11 editorial-page article "Clinton's Fraudulent Trading Policy excoriated our government for using an incorrect statistic while negotiating with China.
Since Mr. Bovard is interested in throwing stones, he may want to check his own glass house.
He refers to President Clinton's speech last July at "Tokyo University."
President Clinton did not speak at Tokyo University (Todai), the pinnacle of the Japanese educational system.
The president and his wife spoke at Waseda University, a prestigious private university.
For reasons that are too complex for Mr. Bovard to bother with, President Clinton did not speak at Todai.
