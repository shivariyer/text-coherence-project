Gaylord Entertainment Co. said it will take a $800,000 charge in the first quarter because of a consolidation of the management team in its Opryland Hospitality & Attractions Group.
A management team of six vice presidents has been established to oversee operations of the group.
In addition, 56 positions will be lost.
The country-music and communications company said the consolidation will result in annualized savings of $4 million.
The charge will be for early retirement and severance payments.
