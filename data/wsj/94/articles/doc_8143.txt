National Car Rental/Interrent, a car rental concern owned by General Motors Corp., said President and Chief Operating Officer Robert J. McKenna will leave the company at the end of January.
Mr. McKenna, 56 years old, said in an interview that leaving was his idea, and he didn't rule out participating in a future effort to buy National Car, which GM is trying to sell.
Jay Alix, a Southfield, Mich., consultant hired by GM to be National's "chief turnaround officer" said in a statement announcing Mr. McKenna's departure that National is now "back on its feet" financially.
Mr. McKenna said National was profitable in 1993.
