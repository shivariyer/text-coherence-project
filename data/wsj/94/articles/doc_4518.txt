Energy BioSystems Corp., The Woodlands, Texas, said it will collaborate with a unit of Dallas-based Dresser Industries Inc. in developing and commercializing its technology for removing sulfur from crude oil.
Energy BioSystems, which develops biotechnology-based processes for the refining and oil-production industries, said Dresser's M.W. Kellogg Co. agreed to provide engineering services for commercial development of desulfurization.
Initial terms of the agreement cover 20 desulfurization units, which Energy BioSystems estimates will generate as much as $40 million in site license fees.
H. David Sloan, senior product technology consultant for refining at M.W. Kellogg, said the Energy BioSystems method potentially is "breakthrough technology for the oil industry, providing more effective desulfurization at substantially lower costs."
Energy BioSystems' process uses enzymes to remove sulfur from crude oil.
