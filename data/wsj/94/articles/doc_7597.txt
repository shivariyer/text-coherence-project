NKK Corp. plans to expand its mandatory furlough program to steelworkers beginning in April, a spokesman for Japan's second-largest steelmaker said.
The company intends to propose the furloughs to its labor union "in the near future," he said.
Management employees have been staying home one to two work days a month since NKK implemented its furlough program in two phases in October and November.
April marks the start of the fiscal year in Japan.
Nippon Steel Corp., Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. and other major steelmakers have already announced such forced furloughs for rank-and-file employees.
At NKK, some 2,000 management employees have been affected by the furlough program, the spokesman said.
NKK has a work force of 23,000, but plans to trim that number by 3,200 over three years.
