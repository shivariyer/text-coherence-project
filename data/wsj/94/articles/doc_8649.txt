UAL Corp.'s United Airlines says its nonrestricted round-trip fare between Chicago and Newark, N.J., is $682 for most travelers.
An article yesterday incorrectly reported the fare was $1,120, which is the highest published fare, but not what most travelers pay.

GRUPO MEXICANO DE DESARROLLO's initial public offering was priced at $34 a unit on Dec. 14, 1993.
Each unit consisted of a Series L share and a Series B share, which immediately began trading separately at $19 for the L shares and $18.875 for the B shares.
The L shares closed at $24.50 on Jan. 14, 1994, up 29% from the opening price.
The B shares closed at $24.25, up 28% from the opening price.
These figures were misstated in yesterday's Investment Insight table, which reflected the entire unit price as the offering price, but only the L share closing price.
