Electric Lightwave Inc., Vancouver, Wash., said it won the right to operate the first local phone service in Washington state.
A unit of closely held Citizens Utilities of Stamford, Conn., Electric Lightwave will set up a switch service for businesses in the Seattle metropolitan area.
The move comes after the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission voted 3-0 to approve the bid.
Last week the state Supreme Court ruled 8-0 that local telephone companies in the state do not have a legal right to be the exclusive provider of communications services in their territories.
The case stemmed from Electric Lightwave's earlier efforts to provide data-transmission services.
Electric Lightwave builds and operates digital, fiber-optic telecommunications networks in the Western U.S.
