Directors of Standard Commercial Corp. reaffirmed the company's opposition to a merger with Dibrell Brothers Inc.
During its meeting Friday, the board said Dibrell's overtures to combine the companies "are not in the best interest of our shareholders."
A year ago, the companies agreed in principle to merge, but Standard later terminated the agreement.
Earlier this month, Dibrell, based in Danville, Va., announced it had purchased 6.2% of Standard's common stock for $7 million over several months.
Both companies are international leaf-tobacco processors and dealers.
Dibrell is also a dealer of fresh-cut flowers, and Standard also processes wool.
