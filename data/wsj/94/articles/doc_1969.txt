Maybe it takes a lawyer to figure out the laws of economics these days.
Consider Vester T. Hughes Jr., the "Hughes" in the prominent Dallas law firm Hughes & Luce.
Each year, at the annual Northern Trust Bank of Texas economic breakfast, wealthy clients are asked to predict the following year's performance of the Dow Jones Industrial averages, the price of gold and the yield of the five-year Treasury bill.
The forecasters include some of the state's heaviest financial-industry hitters.
This year's winner of the crystal-ball trophy: Mr. Hughes.
Mr. Hughes, a tax-law expert, forecast a rise in the Dow of approximately 15%, from 3365.14 on Feb. 25, 1993 to 3870.81 on Feb. 25, 1994.
Close, but a bit too optimistic: The Dow closed at 3838.78 on Feb. 25, up 14% over the previous 12 months.
After a run of 473.64 points, Mr. Hughes was only off by 32.03 points.
The bullish Mr. Hughes, 65, was also a touch too hopeful on the prospects for low inflation and low interest rates.
Gold, he said, would be $318.20 an ounce, instead of the actual close of $379.80, and the five-year T-bill yield would be a mere 5.404%, he predicted.
Actually, the yield was 5.63%.
Lucky guesses?
Perhaps not.
Ever since a client with a large portfolio asked him to manage his funds until they could be turned over to charity, Mr. Hughes has been rising at 5 a.m. to read the day's business news, and he has been an avid market watcher.
"I've been right on some significant calls," says Mr. Hughes, who has no intention of switching careers and becoming a money manager.
"And I've been wrong, too."
One mistake: not foreseeing the bust in the Texas economy.
"I was wrong on the timing," he says.
"It was inevitable and I should have seen it coming.
I had a French client once who said, `Never forget, trees never grow to the sky.'
A lot of Texans forgot trees never grow to the sky."
