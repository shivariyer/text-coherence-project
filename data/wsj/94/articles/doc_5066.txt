Loews Corp. and its CNA Financial Corp. insurance unit reversed year-earlier losses in the fourth quarter.
Loews earned $138.4 million, or $2.20 a share, despite a 49% decrease in net income at its Lorillard cigarette unit.
Lorillard sales declined because of the price cutting on cigarettes.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, Loews, in New York, lost $620.7 million, or $9.53 a share, which included a charge of $822.7 million for reserve additions for asbestos-related bodily injury claims at its majority-owned CNA insurance unit.
CNA, based in Chicago, earned $87.4 million, or $1.40 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $914.3 million, or $14.81 a share.
The reserve additions for asbestos claims explain the loss in 1992.
Loews owns about 83% of CNA.
