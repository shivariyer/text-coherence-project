Boosted by lower interest costs, two supermarket chains, Safeway Inc. and Kroger Co., posted increased earnings for the fourth period.
Despite slower sales, Safeway saw fourth-quarter earnings rise sharply because of lower administrative costs and interest expense.
Kroger reported a 56% jump in fourth-quarter earnings partly reflecting improved sales during the holiday period, reduced costs and lower interest expense.
For the quarter ended Jan. 1, Safeway, based in Oakland, Calif., posted net income of $46.9 million, or 38 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $22.2 million, or 19 cents a share.
Sales in the quarter were $4.70 billion, down 3.1% from $4.85 billion a year ago.
In the most recent fourth quarter, earnings were reduced by $8.7 million, or seven cents a share, because of restructuring charges.
In the year-ago period, restructuring charges reduced net income by $13.8 million, or 12 cents a share.
Operating and administrative expenses during the quarter fell to 23.8% of sales, from 25.2% a year ago.
Interest expense dropped to $77.6 million from $88.9 million.
For the year, Safeway posted net income of $123.3 million, or $1 a share, compared with profit before extraordinary items and accounting changes of $98.4 million, or 83 cents a share.
In the previous year, charges for early retirement of debt and accounting changes resulted in net income of $43.5 million, or 37 cents a share.
Safeway's most recent full-year earnings were reduced by $30.2 million, or 24 cents a share, because of severance costs related to a voluntary employee buyout program at its Alberta, Canada, division.
Kroger, based in Cincinnati, posted net income of $82.7 million, or 76 cents a share, up from $53.1 million, or 57 cents a share, a year ago.
The supermarket chain recorded an extraordinary loss of $3.8 million in the 1993 quarter, and a similar loss of $15.6 million in the 1992 quarter, for the after-tax effect of the early retirement of debt.
Without the item, earnings rose 26% to $86.5 million, up from $68.8 million.
Kroger's sales totaled $5.4 billion, compared with $5.7 billion in the 1992 fourth quarter, which contained an extra week.
After adjusting for the extra week and excluding sales from the company's San Antonio stores, which were sold in 1993, sales rose 3.8% in the latest fourth quarter.
