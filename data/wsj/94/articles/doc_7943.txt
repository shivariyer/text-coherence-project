USAir Group Inc., Arlington, Va., said its fourth-quarter loss narrowed to $116.5 million from $254 million.
On a per-share basis, USAir's loss amounted to $2.29, compared with $5.66 a year earlier.
The airline's revenue rose 10% to $1.8 billion from $1.63 billion in the quarter, as USAir's traffic increased 11.4%.
At the same time, the company's deferral of certain plane orders drove aircraft-rental costs down 43% to $105.3 million.
The latest fourth-quarter loss included a pretax, nonrecurring charge of $60.2 million for the write-down of airport facilities and costs associated with paying certain wages back to retirees as part of a wage-concession program, USAir said.
For the year, USAir had a net loss of $393.1 million, or $8.48 a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $1.23 billion, or $27.23 a share.
Accounting changes related to post-retirement benefits resulted in charges of $43.7 million in 1993 and $628.1 million in 1992.
The 1993 results also included a charge related to work-force reductions.
Revenue rose 5.9% to $7.08 billion from $6.69 billion.
