Deutsche Lufthansa, the state-controlled German airline, achieved its 1993 goal of halving its 1992 operating loss.
Juergen Weber, chairman of the airline's management board, said at a conference in Bonn that the goal has been reached and possibly exceeded.
He wasn't more specific.
Lufthansa's 1992 operating loss topped one billion marks ($571.3 million).
The company's 1994 goal is to break even, Mr. Weber said.
