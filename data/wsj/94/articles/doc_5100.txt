Diane Sawyer renewed her contract with ABC News, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., ending a four-network bidding war for the anchor's services.
As part of the multi-year deal, by next January the network could have newsmagazines airing at 10 p.m. on an unprecedented four nights of the week, pushing out the drama fare that typically airs at that hour.
Three of these newsmagazines would feature Ms. Sawyer either as a co-anchor or contributor.
The network declined to say how much it will pay Ms. Sawyer, who previously earned an estimated $3 million a year, but was reported to have been offered as much as $10 million by at least one other network.
Her colleague Peter Jennings, the anchor of "World News Tonight," earns $7 million a year.
Ms. Sawyer will continue to co-anchor the newsmagazine "PrimeTime Live," which airs Thursdays at 10 p.m., and she will co-anchor the new show "Turning Point," which debuts in March, at 10 p.m.
Ms. Sawyer will also become a contributor to "Day One," which will move to Mondays at 10 p.m. next January from its current 8 p.m.
Monday slot, ABC said yesterday.
The network's fourth 10 p.m. newsmagazine is "20/20," which airs Fridays.
On Tuesdays at that hour, ABC airs the successful police drama, "N.Y.P.D. Blue."
ABC's 1994-95 schedule will be announced in May.
