Grumman Corp. will close about one-third of its factory space, including some historic military aircraft plants on New York's Long Island, as part of a restructuring to be unveiled today.
The restructuring is expected to lead to a charge against 1993 fourth-quarter earnings of $80 million to $90 million, Chairman Renso Caporali said in an interview.
The move, which will eliminate 4.5 million square feet of the company's 15 million square feet of capacity, will center on little-used facilties.
With the closings, Mr. Caporali said, Grumman hopes to save $600 million over the next three years and reduce its overhead costs.
Failure to lower overhead to fit with the times will "bring you down," Mr. Caporali said.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Grumman closed at $41.875, down 37.5 cents.
The restructuring, expected to be completed by the end of 1995, will eliminate about 500 jobs.
However, Mr. Caporali said more jobs are likely to be cut as Grumman copes with future reductions in U.S. military spending.
Grumman's work force peaked in 1987 at about 33,000 employees, but has dropped since to about 18,000.
Declining defense spending has cost Grumman much of its military aircraft business, including the F-14 Navy fighter, which was built on Long Island.
The company, which has developed an extensive data-systems business, remains a player in the defense industry with battle-coordination and surveillance aircraft, such as JSTARS (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Recognition System) and the E-2C Hawkeye.
With the restructuring, both planes will be built in the future at Grumman plants in Florida and Louisiana.
Foremost among the impending plant closings is the shutdown of two Long Island facilities, a 1.5-million-square-foot plant in Calverton and a detail parts facility in Bethpage.
Grumman will keep its headquarters, along with its primary engineering and technical staff, at Bethpage, where it will employ about 8,000 workers.
Mr. Caporali said 1993 revenue will be down about 10% from $3.49 billion in 1992.
When asked about analysts' estimates that the company will post earnings from continuing operations of $3.35 to $3.40 a share for 1993 and $3.50 to $3.75 a share for 1994, he said doesn't "expect any big surprises."
Fourth-quarter and full-year results are scheduled to be released next week.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, Grumman had a net loss of $2.9 million, or nine cents a share, on sales of $930.8 million.
For the first nine months of 1993, the company had net income of $84.3 million, or $2.45 a share, on sales of $2.41 billion.
