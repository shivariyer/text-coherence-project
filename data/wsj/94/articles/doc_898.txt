Ralston Purina Co. directors approved the spinoff of the company's cereal, baby food, crackers and ski resorts businesses -- apparently the last step in a radical downsizing effort.
Approval of the new company, to be known as Ralcorp Holdings Inc., came after the Securities and Exchange Commission accepted registration of the concern's common stock.
After March 31 Ralston and Ralcorp Holdings will be separate and independent concerns, with shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Holders of Ralston-Ralston Purina Group common stock will receive one share of Ralcorp common for every three shares of RPG Group common they own.
Holders of Ralston-Continental Baking Group common aren't entitled to the distribution.
As a result, Ralston Purina will be left with just two businesses -- pet foods and batteries.
