Kellogg Co. is teaming up with ConAgra Inc. to produce a three-variety line of breakfast cereals under the Healthy Choice label.
The multigrain products are seen as a way for ConAgra to expand the reach of its Healthy Choice line of foods, and for cereal-industry leader Kellogg to reap some of the higher profit margins rival General Mills Inc. realizes on its line of Total vitamin-fortified cereals.
The venture represents the first licensing by ConAgra of the Healthy Choice name.
The Omaha, Neb.-based company discontinued Healthy Choice breakfast sandwiches and muffins, but still sells a frozen egg product.
Wall Street was initially uncertain about the concept as analysts predicted some cannibalization of Kellogg's NutriGrain and Low-Fat Granola products, both aimed at the same nutrition-conscious consumer the Healthy Choice items presumably would appeal to.
Shares of ConAgra rose 75 cents on the news, to $28, while those of Kellogg slipped $1, to close at $48.25, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
Some of Kellogg's decline was attributed to a dampening of first-quarter earnings estimates by Kellogg's chairman.
