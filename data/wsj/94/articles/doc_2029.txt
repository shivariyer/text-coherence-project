General Instrument Corp., moving to defuse a battle over technical standards for digital television, said it will license Motorola Inc. to manufacture its microchip technology for use in future cable and satellite-TV systems.
General Instrument in Chicago, the No. 1 maker of TV set-top decoder devices, agreed to let Motorola build chips based on its proprietary DigiCipher II technology, which handles key functions for interactive television, including video compression and scrambling features for preventing piracy.
The chips also can handle signals compressed using a rival international standard, called MPEG-2, that is being developed by an international standards group.
Some potential customers had postponed orders for the proprietary General Instrument technology, to wait for MPEG-2 products, said Steve Krause, an analyst at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif.
