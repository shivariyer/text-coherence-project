I must not let pass the possible misrepresentation of the late Father Laszlo Ladany's unique contribution to China scholarship in the newsletter he founded, China News Analysis.
("After Years of Tracking China's Change, Jesuit Scholars Plan to Leave Hong Kong," Feb. 10.)
The impression provided by Father Michel Masson, one of the current editors of the newsletter, is that because of an "anti-Communist twist" Father Ladany was less than objective and less "focused on economic change."
This is an unworthy insinuation and untrue.
The proof is in the 30-year record of his newsletter.
In the recent past, many sinologists world-wide, whose writings were slanted sympathetically, if not sycophantically, toward Maoism -- a common phenomenon before 1978 -- could not ignore this convenient source of hardheaded, scrupulously accurate information on the Chinese Communist system, particularly the economy.
Consider, on the other hand, this ironic "twist": The current editors of China News Analysis plan to move their office to Taiwan, a country whose invitations to participate in scholarly conferences Father Ladany consistently refused for many years because his newsletter was banned there.
