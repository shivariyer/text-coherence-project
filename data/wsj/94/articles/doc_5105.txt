At the request of Whitewater special counsel Robert Fiske, a federal judge agreed to create a special grand jury to look into President Clinton's real estate investment.
The extensive scope of Mr. Fiske's investigation was revealed in the judge's order, which said the inquiry was expected to involve more than one million documents, 200 to 300 interviews and more than 20 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and other assistants.
Mr. Fiske also disclosed that his office next month will try the case of Little Rock businessman David Hale.
Charged with defrauding the Small Business Administration, Mr. Hale says he was pressured by Mr. Clinton and James McDougal, the owner of a failed S&L, to make a $300,000 loan backed by the SBA.
The loan went to a company owned by Susan McDougal, Mr. McDougal's wife at the time.
Mr. Clinton has steadfastly denied pressuring Mr. Hale.
In addition, Mr. Fiske said he also would try any new indictment against Mr. McDougal, who was acquitted in 1990 of bank fraud charges.
The Clintons were 50-50 investors with the McDougals in Whitewater Development Corp.
Mr. Fiske is investigating Whitewater and the failed S&L, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan.
