Air-traffic controllers should keep small planes farther away from the wake of Boeing 757s and other planes of similar weight, the National Transportation Safety Board said.
The move comes after a slew of incidents in which pilots of small jets and turboprop planes lost control of their planes while behind Boeing Co.'s 757s.
The safety board played down the theory that the 757's wake is especially troublesome because of the plane's wing design.
The board said problems with the Federal Aviation Administration's weight classifications, and inadequate training for pilots, were bigger factors in five recent crashes.
The safety board recommended that pilots stay as far behind the 757 as they do behind heavier airplanes, but stopped short of calling for the 757 to be classified as a "heavy" aircraft.
Because the 757 weighs less than 300,000 pounds, it is classified as "large," meaning small planes currently can trail by four miles instead of six miles for heavy aircraft.
Officials of Boeing, Seattle, said they hadn't seen the board's recommendations yet, but that small planes haven't encountered any problems when they've followed current separation standards.
