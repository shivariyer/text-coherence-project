A federal judge dismissed charges of insider trading brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against two stockbrokers in connection with Philip Morris Cos.' takeover of Kraft Inc. in 1988.
Judge Loretta A. Preska in Manhattan, New York, signed the order last week dismissing the charges against Frank S. Petrone and James Zanengo of Rickel & Associates in Millburn, N.J.
The judge said the SEC didn't meet its burden of proof.
Andrew Geist, assistant regional director for the SEC's Northeast office, said the agency will await a copy of the ruling before deciding whether to appeal.
A third defendant, Anthony M. Morelli, Mr. Petrone's father-in-law, agreed to pay a $50,000 fine with no admission of guilt on the eve of the start of trial Jan. 31.
He also has been enjoined from violating certain provisions of federal securities law.
In the suit filed in June 1991, the SEC said Mr. Morelli, a director of headquarters services at Philip Morris, gained access to inside information while preparing a meeting room for executives just hours before the takeover was announced.
The SEC said Mr. Morelli passed the information to his son-in-law, who told Mr. Zanengo.
The SEC alleged Mr. Zanengo told two other brokers.
Mr. Zanengo has since left Rickel, the company said.
The SEC said profit from the alleged insider trading was $333,973.
The transactions occurred Oct. 17, 1988, a few hours before the announcement.
On Oct. 18, Kraft stock rose $28.375 to $88.50.
Mr. Geist said the judge found Mr. Morelli's denials "credible," adding, "We had no witnesses who said Mr. Morelli overheard conversations or saw documents" relating to the takeover.
