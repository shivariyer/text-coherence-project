Ford Motor Co., broadening its effort to penetrate China's auto market, said it reached a preliminary agreement with a Chinese parts supplier to jointly produce plastic parts for autos.
The agreement is a first for Ford, which has been engaged in negotiations with several parts suppliers in China for more than a year.
Ford said it's involved in discussions with several Chinese manufacturers that could lead to joint ventures in other areas, such as glass, electronics, engine management and air conditioning.
Ford's move comes at a time when all of the Western auto makers are scrambling to get a stronghold in the Chinese auto market.
Ford is competing with other auto companies for a planned joint venture to build multipurpose vehicles.
And Ford also has expressed interest in building vehicles in China.
Ford already exports North American-built vehicles to China.
"We recognize the importance of establishing long and solid partnerships in China in order to participate in the growth of the Chinese automotive industry," said Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive officer.
"What Ford brings to these partnerships is our international expertise in quality, technology, product development, manufacturing and management practices."
Details of the plastics joint venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. have yet to be worked out.
But a Ford spokesman said the deal is worth "tens of millions of dollars."
The agreement should be finalized within a few weeks and then submitted to Chinese government officials for approval.
Under terms of the agreement, Shanghai Automotive Industry's Yan Feng division and Ford's plastic and trim products division will collaborate to produce automotive parts, including interior trim, seats, instrument panels and other plastic parts for the Chinese auto market.
The Ford spokesman said Ford is already training Yan Feng engineers in computer-design technology.
