Sun Alliance Group PLC said it is selling its leasehold interests in the Harlequin Shopping Center in Watford, north of London, to Capital & Counties, a unit of Transatlantic Holdings PLC.
The sale, for #162 million ($242.3 million), is to be completed on Feb. 28 and represents an out-of-court settlement between the two parties.
C&C and Sun Alliance were jointly involved in the Harlequin project in 1988.
Following the United Kingdom property market recession that began in the late 1980s, C&C disputed the joint venture agreement.
As the agreement stood then, C&C wasn't getting the returns expected from the Harlequin center.
Sun refused to renegotiate the contract, and court proceedings instituted by C&C began last week.
With this purchase, C&C is effectively buying out all of Sun Alliance's interests in the venture.
