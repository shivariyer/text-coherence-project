Continental Airlines, Houston, said it will offer a free "companion" ticket to customers purchasing round-trip seats in its BusinessFirst section, its highest-priced trans-Atlantic seats, as well as certain economy tickets, when flying to Paris from six Southern and Western states.
The airline said the tickets must be bought by March 15.
Travel with the free companion ticket can begin immediately and must be completed by April 15.
Continental said the 2-for-1 discount reduces a typical round-trip business-class fare, between Houston and Paris, to $1,769 from $3,538.
Flying from Los Angeles, the fare is cut to $1,880 from $3,760.
A spokesman said the discount matches a similar recent offering by Air France.
