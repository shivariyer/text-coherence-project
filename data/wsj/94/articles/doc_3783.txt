Viacom Inc.'s MTV Networks unit, in a move to reposition its VH-1 music-video channel, named John Sykes, part of the original management team at MTV in the early 1980s, as president of VH-1.
Mr. Sykes, 38 years old, succeeds Ed Bennett, who had been president of VH-1 for the past five years.
Mr. Bennett, 46, resigned to pursue other opportunities, the company said.
He couldn't be reached for comment.
But MTV clearly brought Mr. Sykes back in a bid to energize VH-1, which is aimed at an older, more affluent audience than MTV's primary MTV network.
Mr. Sykes joins VH-1 from Thorn EMI PLC's EMI Music Publishing Worldwide, where he was executive vice president of talent acquisition and marketing.
During his time there, he forged strong ties with the recording industry, signing such artists as Stone Temple Pilots, Danzig and Counting Crows.
Earlier, he served as president of EMI's Chrysalis Records, where he guided the label's U.S. operations.
After his first stint at MTV, he joined Hollywood's Creative Artists Agency as a music agent.
Thomas Freston, chairman and chief executive officer of MTV Networks, said Mr. Sykes will aim to attract a "younger, hipper, more contemporary audience."
He added, "We're talking people 25 to 40 years old -- not so much the Baby Boomers -- almost between Baby Boomers and so-called Generation X. They are graduates of MTV, but they don't like the edge of `Dr. Dre' and `Guns & Roses.'"
The move comes at a time when MTV and VH-1 face major new competitors who will launch music networks later this year.
With 50 million subscribers, VH-1 has long struggled to define an audience and stand out of the shadow of its larger sister network, MTV, with 57.3 million subscribers.
While VH-1 is profitable and has good distribution on cable systems, its 1993 net ad revenue is only about a quarter of MTV's $155 million.
Household ratings are weak compared with MTV.
