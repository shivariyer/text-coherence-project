Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings to single-A-1 from double-A-3 for $1.8 billion of Walt Disney Co. long-term debt securities, including senior unsecured notes, debentures and medium-term notes.
The New York-based rating service said the downgrades reflect expectations that operations at the EuroDisney theme park near Paris will remain "under pressure at least in the intermediate term and that as a result, uncertainty over Walt Disney's future financial commitments to the project will increase its risk profile."
Moody's said it expects the EuroDisney debt restructuring being negotiated between Disney and a group of lenders "will likely result in the sharing of the financial burden with concessions from both sides."
It noted that recent seasonal EuroDisney price reductions make it harder to maintain revenue levels, while citing other challenges for Disney, which is based in Burbank, Calif.
Disney as a whole "will remain very profitable, and should continue to generate strong cash flows, thanks to its more mature diversified franchises," Moody's said.
But the downgrades also reflect Disney's "changing operating profile," where "external funding and/or cash on hand" may be needed to help it grow as a multimedia provider over the next few years.
A Disney spokesman said the Moody's rate cut was "only a notch, and it shouldn't impact our borrowing cost in any way."
He noted that the company is maintaining its double-A rating with Standard & Poor's Corp.
