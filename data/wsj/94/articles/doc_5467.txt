Pace American Group Inc. said it notified two top executives it intends to dismiss them because an internal investigation found evidence of "self-dealing" and "undisclosed financial relationships."
The executives are Don H. Pace, cofounder, president and chief executive officer; and Greg S. Kaplan, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Mr. Pace "believes that he is being treated unfairly by the company and that the actions of the company are being motivated by bad faith and are not in the best interests of shareholders," said his lawyer, Paul Fischer, of Washington D.C.
Mr. Kaplan's lawyer, William G. Walker, said Mr. Kaplan is "legally and ethically innocent of any wrongdoing.
All of his activities . . . were known to his corporate superiors at all times."
Both executives have been on leave from the surety-bond concern since early this month pending the findings of an internal investigation by a board committee.
Under terms of the executives' employment contracts, they have 21 days to respond to the notices before they can be dismissed, the company said in a statement.
The alleged acts include "Mr. Pace's undisclosed receipt of portions of commissions paid by a subsidiary of the company to one of its agents, and the undisclosed receipt by both executives of fees paid by contractors who were bonded by a company subsidiary through a former agent," the statement said.
Company officials, including its general counsel, Dando B. Cellini, didn't return calls seeking clarification.
In its statement, the company said the investigation continues.
