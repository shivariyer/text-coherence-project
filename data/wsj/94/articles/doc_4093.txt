Potlatch Corp. said John M. Richards, president and chief operating officer, was named chairman and chief executive, effective in May.
Mr. Richards, 56 years old, will succeed Richard B. Madden, who will retire after the company's annual meeting May 19.
Mr. Madden, 64, will have reached Potlatch's mandatory retirement age of 65 by the date of the meeting.
Potlatch said L. Pendleton Siegel, 51, will succeed Mr. Richards as president and chief operating officer.
Mr. Siegel is executive vice president of the forest-products company's pulp operations and planning.
The moves, which were expected, mark the end of a long reign for Mr. Madden.
He joined Potlatch in 1971 as chief executive and president, and added the title of chairman in 1977.
He is generally given good marks by analysts, having propelled Potlatch's sales to $1.4 billion last year from $360 million in 1971.
He also refocused the company on its more profitable, less cyclical segments, trimming Potlatch's business lines to five from 15.
Mr. Richards isn't expected to undertake any dramatic shifts in strategy.
Many analysts think the company is better positioned than other forest products companies, partly because it has focused on acquiring and developing timberlands in areas such as Minnesota and Arkansas, which are less environmentally contentious than California and the Pacific Northwest.
