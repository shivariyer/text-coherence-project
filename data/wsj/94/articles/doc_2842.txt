Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., in two separate rulings by National Labor Relations Board judges, was ordered to pay an estimated $3 million in back wages and interest to some 4,000 employees and 14 fired workers.
The rulings, one pertaining to a 1991 union-organizing campaign and the other to a worker who was dismissed in 1993, found Fieldcrest guilty of more than 150 labor-law violations.
Most of the violations involved the textile company's alleged interference with the unsuccessful 1991 organizing campaign by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
Ozzie Raines, vice president, human resources, for Fieldcrest Cannon, said the Eden, N.C.-based company would appeal at least a portion of the rulings.
He added that Fieldcrest hadn't determined which portion would be appealed.
Fieldcrest was found guilty of discriminating against union employees by giving nonunion employees slightly larger wage increases in 1991.
Fieldcrest also was found guilty of illegally firing union supporters during the 1991 campaign, which the union narrowly lost.
The company was ordered to reinstate the fired employees.
