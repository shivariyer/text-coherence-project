Reebok International Ltd.'s chairman and his wife each plan to sell two million of their Reebok shares, reducing their combined stake to 17% from 21%.
They plan to sell three million shares in a public offering, and Reebok said it plans to purchase an additional one million shares from the Firemans subject to approval by a special committee of Reebok's board.
That would reduce the Stoughton, Mass., footwear company's shares outstanding to 82.5 million shares.
After the sale, Chairman Paul Fireman will hold 7.9 million shares, or a 9.5% stake, and his wife, Phyllis, 6.3 million shares, or 7.4%.
Reebok shares closed at $33.75, up 25 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
That would indicate that the Firemans will raise $135 million through the sale.
Paul Duncan, chief financial officer, said the sales were being made for portfolio diversification.
