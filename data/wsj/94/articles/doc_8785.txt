Oracle Corp. postponed an elaborate press event to unveil new multimedia software because of the Los Angeles earthquake.
The company had arranged live video hookups to broadcast the event to New York, Washington, Tokyo and London from CBS studios in Hollywood.
Besides Oracle executives, planned participants were to include former newscaster Walter Cronkite, publisher Malcolm Forbes Jr. and Raymond Smith, chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic Corp.
Oracle representatives said the quake didn't damage the set it constructed at CBS, and computers at the studio appeared to work normally once electrical power was restored.
The company nevertheless decided to postpone the event out of concern for participants' safety amid continuing aftershocks in the area, and because of transportation problems.
It expects to set a new date for the event in about a week.
