Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the long-term debt rating of Scott Paper Co. to Baa1 from single-A-3, citing weakness in Scott's tissue-paper business.
About $1.8 billion in debt is affected.
The debt-rating agency said it believed the long-term profitability of the worldwide tissue business will be substantially reduced, making Scott's earnings in that segment more volatile.
Moody's said the previous high level and stable profitability of the tissue business had been a key element of Scott's debt rating.
Scott, which is based in Philadelphia and also sells cleaning products and printing papers, took a $381 million charge for the fourth quarter on Wednesday as part of a sweeping effort to cut costs.
"We don't share Moody's point of view that the long-term profitability of tissue will be substantially reduced," a Scott spokesman said.
"Also, this action comes at a time when we've just put the pieces together to begin showing improvement."
