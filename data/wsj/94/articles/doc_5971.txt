Newly public GP Financial Corp., parent of Green Point Savings Bank, said pro-forma profit in the fiscal second quarter rose 18%, boosted by higher net-interest income and a drop in provisions for loan losses and income taxes.
GP Financial, which had its initial public offering Jan. 28, reported pro-forma net income for the second quarter ended Dec. 31 of $28.1 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with $23.9 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier.
Provisions for loan losses fell 5% to $12.2 million from $12.9 million.
For the first six months, GP Financial had net income of $56.2 million, or $1.02 a share, compared with net income of $44.3 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier.
The year-earlier period included a $5.3 million charge for accounting changes.
The company said higher net-interest income and a drop in income taxes for the period were partially offset by increases in net-interest expense and provisions for loan losses.
Loan-loss provisions for the six months rose 16% to $25.3 million from $21.8 million.
Effective Jan. 1, GP Financial, New York, said it's changing its fiscal year to a calendar year.
