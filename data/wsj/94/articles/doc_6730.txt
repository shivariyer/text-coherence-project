Bond prices sank on speculation that the Federal Reserve has decided to boost short-term interest rates.
Stock prices followed bonds lower, and the dollar rose.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.88 points to 3967.66.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.29 to 480.71 and the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1.78 to 797.79.
Traders speculated about a rise in rates after the Fed failed to intervene in the market when the federal funds rate was trading above the targeted 3% level.
"I would take that as a sign the Fed has begun to tighten," said Donald Maude, chief U.S. fixed-income strategist at Scotia McLeod (USA).
"It's very, very subtle -- at best an implicit indication they may be moving."
Mr. Maude said an imminent move would surprise him.
But he believes recent strength in commodities prices and some inflationary pressures in the latest purchasing managers' reports may have forced the Fed's hand.
Alan Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said he expects the Fed to shift its stance from neutral to a bias toward tightening during the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends today.
But he thinks there's only a 25% chance of a boost in short rates today, with the odds rising to 75% by mid-March.
The industrial average plunged more than 25 points during the session, but bounced back in late trading.
Analysts said the rebound suggests that investors are appropriately focused on the positive economic environment.
