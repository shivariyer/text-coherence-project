First Fidelity Bancorp. said it is expanding its 1994 common-stock repurchase program by 1.3 million shares to 2.9 million shares.
Last fall, the board authorized the company to repurchase on an annual basis the equivalent of 2% of its common stock outstanding, or 1.6 million shares.
The expanded program comes in addition to existing stock-repurchase programs for the company's dividend-reinvestment and stock-option plans.
