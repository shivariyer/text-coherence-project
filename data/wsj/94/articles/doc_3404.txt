South Korea's state-owned Korea Telecom said Thursday its third bid to sell a 21% stake in the nation's mobile-phone monopoly, Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corp., drew no satisfactory buyers in recent auctions.
According to company officials, three individuals took part in the biddings, held Feb. 28 and March 2, but failed to put forward the minimum price of 330,000 won ($408) a share set by the company.
The three applicants offered to buy shares of the cellular phone monopoly at 105,000 won a share for a combined order of 690 shares, company officials said.
The 21% stake of Korea Mobile Telecom represents about 1.2 million shares.
In early January the South Korean government said it would sell 44% of the equity in the mobile-phone monopoly as part of efforts to slim the nation's bulky state-run corporations.
Sunkyong Group, in a late-January auction, bought a controlling stake in the company by purchasing 23% of its equity, or about 1.3 million shares, through the group's three affiliates.
In the second bidding, in February, 2,380 shares were sold to 10 people.
According to company officials, Korea Mobile Telecom may offer the remaining shares at prices lower than recent value after consultations with the government.
The South Korean government restricted the purchase of the shares, barring participation of institutional investors in auctions and forcing a mandatory shareholding period of one year.
Currently, Korea Mobile Telecom is the only concern that installs and operates cellular phones in South Korea, where demand for mobile phones is expected to explode in a few years.
