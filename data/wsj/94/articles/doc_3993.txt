OTO MELARA SpA of Italy, the maker of a 127mm naval gun procured by the South Korean navy, says that trials conducted by the Italian navy confirm the gun's compatibility with five-inch U.S. shells and that the South Korean military is satisfied with the test results.
An article Dec. 29 on South Korea's arms purchases said the gun was incompatible with the U.S. ammunition, a view expressed by U.S. defense officials.
