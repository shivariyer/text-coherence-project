Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI PLC, and other industry officials said rampant pirating of music and plans for "information superhighways" threaten the survival of their business.
"The industry has been a great success," Sir Colin said at a news conference here.
"But that alone will not guarantee its survival against the challenges of digital convergences, trade barriers, obsolete intellectual property laws and the huge illegal economy of record piracy."
A report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry released at the conference warned that the healthy growth of the world's major recording companies is likely to suffer unless the fight against piracy intensifies and new copyright legislation is hammered out.
According to IFPI figures, revenues from sales of records, compact disks and cassette tapes more than tripled to $10.53 billion in the 18-nation European Economic Area in the decade to 1992.
That represents more than a third of the industry's worldwide revenues of $28.8 billion.
But the IFPI warns that the global industry loses some $2 billion a year to piracy, $427 million of it in the EEA.
Many of the bootleg compact disks and tapes are churned out in factories in Eastern Europe and Asia.
China alone can produce up to 75 million disks a year in 25 such plants, the IFPI said.
"China is developing the capacity to destroy legitimate recording companies," warned IFPI's director general, Nicholas Garnett.
