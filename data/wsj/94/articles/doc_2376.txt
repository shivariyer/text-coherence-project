Harcourt General Inc.
Chief Executive Robert J. Tarr told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that Harcourt General has had "serious interest expressed by qualified bidders" in its insurance unit.
He also reiterated an upbeat 1994 earnings outlook.
Mr. Tarr said that while no sale announcement was imminent, "we expect a full price if we move forward."
Such a move would entail some near-term earnings dilution, he said.
In February, Harcourt said it might sell the insurance unit to concentrate on publishing.
The company also has interest in retailing.
Mr. Tarr said that with possible proceeds from any sale and excess cash from other units, "we are actively seeking acquisition opportunities" to strengthen the company's publishing focus.
Harcourt General had $490 million of cash on hand at Jan. 31.
Mr. Tarr also told holders the fiscal 1994 outlook is good despite flat sales expected for the Harcourt Brace publishing unit.
Sales at the majority owned, publicly traded Neiman Marcus Group retailer have been strong.
But Mr. Tarr noted continued problems at the Contempo Casuals unit.
"We're confident we'll be able to achieve an increase" over operating earnings of $1.93 a share in fiscal 1993, he said.
In the year ended Oct. 30, the Newton, Mass.-based company reported net income of $171.3 million, or $2.15 a share, including seven cents a share from discontinued theater operations spun off last year, and 15 cents a share from a legal settlement related to Harcourt's retail business.
Harcourt's shares closed at $36.625, up $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
