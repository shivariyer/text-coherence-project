The New York State Banking Department rebuked Green Point Savings Bank, saying top executives were seeking to enrich themselves in a conversion plan while failing to make sure the bank was valued fairly.
The department issued an order allowing the bank to proceed with its plan to convert from a mutual savings bank to stock ownership, but it imposed a lengthy list of stringent requirements.
The order requires Green Point to appoint three new independent directors to make sure the bank complies with the order.
The order said the bank must drop plans to issue stock grants to trustees and officers.
It requires Green Point to defer granting any future stock options for at least one year after the conversion and to make such options subject to approval by an independent compensation committee.
The plan had called for Green Point to issue as much as $21 million in stock to officers and trustees.
Green Point, which has $6.5 billion in assets, agreed to the terms in a settlement, but didn't admit or deny the department's findings.
A Banking Department spokeswoman said the findings weren't directly related to proposed federal guidelines seeking to prevent insiders from reaping excessive profits in conversions of mutual savings banks to stock ownership.
