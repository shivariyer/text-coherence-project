Albertson's Inc. said increased same-store sales and cost containment helped it to post a 20% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter net income.
For the period ended Feb. 3, net grew to $127 million, or 50 cents a share, from $105.7 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue increased 14% to $3.1 billion from $2.7 billion.
The Boise, Idaho-based supermarket concern said sales rose 2.2% at stores open at least a year.
In the year, net grew 26% to $339.7 million, or $1.34 a share, from $269.2 million, or $1.02 a share.
The latest results include a $30 million charge to settle an employment-discrimination lawsuit.
Revenue rose 11% to $11.3 billion from $10.2 billion on a 2.8% same-store rise in sales.
