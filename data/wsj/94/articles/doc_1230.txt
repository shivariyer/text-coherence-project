John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. agreed to pay $1 million to settle allegations that its lobbyists illegally gave Massachusetts state legislators free hotel rooms, theater tickets, a Super Bowl trip and other gifts over the past seven years.
In a probe by the U.S. attorney and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, John Hancock was found to have allegedly paid a number of legislators more than $35,000 in gifts from January 1986 to May 1993 in various forms, including free meals, golf games, sports tickets and other perks.
The legislator who received the most gifts was, at the time he received them, chairman of the House joint committee on insurance "whose deliberations and decisions were of greatest importance to Hancock," the U.S. attorney's office said.
Federal officials declined to name the legislator.
John Hancock said its own internal investigation led it to voluntarily disclose the violations to state officials.
"Today's agreements are an important step in resolving this matter and ensuring that the activities that led to this problem don't happen again," the company said in a statement.
The U.S. attorney's office filed a civil complaint in federal court in Boston alleging that the gifts were part of a scheme to defraud the public.
Under the settlement, John Hancock, an insurance concern based in Boston, will pay the U.S. government $900,000 and the state of Massachusetts $110,000.
The company also will admit to hundreds of violations of state gratuity laws.
As part of the agreement, the U.S. attorney's office dismissed the complaint against the company.
However, the investigation of employees and state legislators is continuing.
