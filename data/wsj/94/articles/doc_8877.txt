As a latke lover, I was fascinated by your Dec. 14 page-one article about the "Perfect Potato Pancake" and would like to add the following to the subject: etymologically, the word latke (plural, latkes) comes from the old Slavic word olad'ya, from which the current Polish word oadka was derived.
Thus the Yiddish term "latke" most likely is the syncopated version of olatka.
The basic raw material, the Peruvian potato, occasionally called pyrki in Eastern Europe, appeared on the European scene only in the 18th century via England and Ireland.
The Byelorussians, especially around Minsk, also hold potato pancakes in high regard and call them dranki, "the shredded ones."
I fully agree that latkes ( O'latkes) taste especially good with cool sour cream and a kosher dill pickle.
Your story about the annual potato-pancake suppers held at Boise's Congregation Ahavath Beth Israel sent me to the kitchen several days straight, peeling, grating, frying and flipping.
And for all my efforts, I have decided that the only way to make potato pancakes is to simply peel the potatoes, grate them (Cuisinarting is OK), add a pinch of salt, and fry them in oil (turning once and never pressing down on them as they fry).
Prepared this way, you'll not only have potato pancakes like the ones my mother and other hausfraus made in Bavaria, but also like the ones Gunter Grass describes at some length in "The Tin Drum": thin disks of heaven, edged in crisp golden lace.
Maybe this was the manna God sent to the Israelites lost in the wilderness.
If so, they were lucky indeed.

My grandmother was not a hippie!
She taught me that matzo meal is added to Latke's because it absorbs the water the potatoes leave out, while also sitting more readily than flour and because one needs so much less, giving a lighter more "potato" flavored latke.
In vegetable pancakes perhaps.
In Latke's, never!)

Bisquick in latkes?
A sacrilege!
