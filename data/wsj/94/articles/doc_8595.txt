By a margin of more than 2-to-1, members of the Chicago Board of Trade voted to pay $26 million for an adjoining building that the exchange plans to use to expand its facilities.
The badly needed expansion, which will include a new 60,000-square-foot trading floor that spans a Chicago street, is expected to cost $171.5 million.
"This has been a hotly contested issue and I am delighted that our membership had the confidence to support this proposal," said CBOT Chairman Patrick H. Arbor.
