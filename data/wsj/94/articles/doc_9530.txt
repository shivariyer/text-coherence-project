Two Southeastern banks, Barnett Banks Inc. and SunTrust Banks Inc., reported strong gains in fourth-quarter earnings.
Both institutions attributed the increases to improvements in operating efficiency and loan quality.
SunTrust, based in Atlanta, said strong growth in fee income also contributed to the earnings gain.
Improvements at both banks were offset somewhat by the continued tightening of net-interest margins.
For the fourth quarter, Barnett, based in Jacksonville, Fla., reported that earnings jumped to $113.3 million, or $1.11 a share, from $6.2 million, or two cents a share, a year earlier.
The 1992 figures include a $67.4 million restructuring charge related to an acquisition.
For the year, Barnett reported record earnings of $421 million, or $4.10 a share.
That compares with 1992 net income of $207.7 million, or $1.97 a share, including the restructuring charge.
Boosting the bank's performance in 1993 was its big reduction in credit costs; nonperforming assets fell 46% to $458.3 million from $843.3 million a year earlier.
SunTrust in the fourth quarter reported that net income rose 33% to $119.2 million, or 97 cents a share, from a restated $89.5 million, or 70 cents a share.
SunTrust's net income for 1993 rose 17% to $473.7 million, or $3.77 a share, from $404.4 million, or $3.13 a share, a year earlier.
The increase was fueled by growth in both fee income and loans.
The bank's 1993 trust income, for instance, rose 9.3% to $247 million from $226 million in 1992.
Loans increased 7.7% to $25.3 billion from $23.5 billion in 1992.
Mounting pressure throughout the industry on net-interest margins -- the difference between what a bank earns on loans and investments and what it pays for deposits -- was evident at both banks.
Barnett saw its yield in the fourth quarter decline to 4.98% from 5.09% in the third quarter of 1993.
At SunTrust, the net-interest margin dropped to 4.60% in the fourth quarter from 4.76% in the preceding period.
During 1993, Barnett's margin declined to 5.07% from 5.11% in 1992, while SunTrust's margin dropped to 4.80% from 5.10% the year earlier.
