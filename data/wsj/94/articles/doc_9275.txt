Columbia Gas System Inc. is expected to file a plan of reorganization sometime this month in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., according to people familiar with the plan.
The natural-gas company, based in Wilmington, whose main unit is Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., has received several extensions of its exclusive period to file a plan of reorganization; the latest extension is to expire March 22.
Columbia said last year that its projected timetable for emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings had been severely disrupted by legal and other issues.
The company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in mid-1991, had been devastated when spot gas prices plunged while it remained obligated to thousands of restrictive, above-market-price gas contracts.
The disputed claims over its cancellation of natural-gas contracts could exceed $10 billion.
