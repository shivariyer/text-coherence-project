Westbridge Capital Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, more than doubled its operating profit last year, the company's chairman said.
Martin Kantor, chairman for the supplemental health insurer, said the company's operating earnings last year were $3.5 million, or 78 cents a share, compared with $1.8 million, or 40 cents a share, in 1992.
Revenue in 1993 grew about 20% to $75 million.
The company will report results today.
Wall Street views operating earnings as more significant for insurance companies than net income because net includes capital gains and one-time gains and charges.
A string of acquisitions contributed to the growth.
During the past 17 months, the company has acquired three blocks of health insurance business from other insurers and agreed to acquire two others, Mr. Kantor said.
The company has retained Oppenheimer & Co. to help with financing.
Mr. Kantor says he is undaunted by the prospect of health-care reform.
He said the market for supplemental coverage will still exist after reform because plans being discussed by the Clinton administration and others only offer a basic package of primary coverage.
