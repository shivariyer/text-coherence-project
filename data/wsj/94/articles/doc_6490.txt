M.I.M. Holdings Ltd., an Australian metal mining and refining company, said four international banks have committed to underwrite as much as $175 million in financing to assist with development of M.I.M.'s McArthur River zinc-lead-silver mine in Australia's Northern Territory.
The banks are Westpac Banking Corp.; NatWest Australia Bank Ltd., a unit of National Westminster Bank PLC; Credit Lyonnais Australia Ltd., a unit of Credit Lyonnais of France; and AIDC Ltd.
The project, expected to cost 250 million Australian dollars (US$178 million), is a joint venture between Mount Isa Mines Ltd., with 70%, and ANT Minerals Pty Ltd., which represents several Japanese partners and holds 30%.
Production is expected to start in 1995.
Separately, M.I.M. said it signed a definitive agreement with International Musto Explorations Ltd. of Canada to develop jointly the Bajo de la Alumbrera gold-copper deposit in Catamarca Province, Argentina.
M.I.M. has agreed to pay International Musto $130 million for its 50% stake in the project.
