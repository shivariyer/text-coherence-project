Crane Co., a Stamford, Conn., maker of industrial products for the aerospace and construction industries, said it increased its offer to acquire Mark Controls Corp. to $15.50 a share, from $13 a share.
Mark Controls, a Skokie, Ill., industrial-valve manufacturer, said it is reviewing the revised bid although it came "outside the process established by Mark Controls' board."
The company said it also has had interest expressed by other companies.
The sweetened offer, totaling $78 million in cash, reflects a 74% premium over the trading value of Mark Controls' stock prior to the time Crane announced its initial 13.2% stake in the company in January.
Yesterday, in trading on the Nasdaq stock market, Mark Controls' shares closed at $16, up $1.25, on volume of 182,000 shares.
