Rite Aid Corp. reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $71.4 million, or 81 cents a share, mainly due to charges for a previously announced restructuring and the disposal of certain operations.
The Camp Hill, Pa., drugstore chain had a profit in the year-earlier quarter of $45.8 million, or 52 cents a share.
The latest period, which ended Feb. 26, included a restructuring charge of $91 million, or $1.03 a share, reflecting steps that included the closing of about 200 drugstores.
Rite Aid also took a charge of $23.7 million, or 27 cents a share, related to its disposal of non-drugstore businesses.
The company said it was selling the businesses to focus on its drugstores and expand into the managed-care end of the pharmacy business.
Total sales in the quarter rose 3% to $1.08 billion, but sales at stores open at least a year were up just 1.8%, "hampered by the severe winter weather," Rite Aid said.
As of the end of February, the company had 2,690 locations.
For the year, net income was $9.3 million, or 11 cents a share, down from $132.4 million, or $1.51 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 5.9% to $4.06 billion.
