Food Lion Inc. reported a fourth-quarter loss of $73 million, or 15 cents a share, reflecting a major charge for closing unprofitable stores.
The Salisbury, N.C., supermarket chain said the loss compared with earnings of $27.3 million, or six cents a share, in 1992's fourth quarter.
Revenue rose 6% to $2.40 billion from $2.27 billion.
As expected, the company established a pretax reserve of $170.5 million in the quarter to cover costs associated with store closings.
Last month, Food Lion said it would close 88 stores this year.
For all of 1993, Food Lion reported that net income, including the reserve, fell to $3.9 million, or one cent a share, from $178 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 6% to $7.61 billion from $7.20 billion.
