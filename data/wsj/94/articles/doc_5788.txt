Penn Central Corp. said it is mulling a proposal to acquire the personal-lines insurance operations of a unit of American Financial Corp. for about $380 million.
The personal-lines business of the Great American Insurance Co. unit reported net earned premiums of $342 million in 1993.
About 70% of these premiums came from standard private passenger automobile insurance, Penn said.
American's sale proposal would include the transfer by the unit of an investment portfolio of securities with a current market value of about $450 million.
Penn, which is mainly involved in specialty property and casualty insurance, said its directors had concluded that the proposed acquisition "merits serious consideration".
They named a special committee of outside directors to review the proposal.
American Financial owns 40.5% of Penn Central's shares and American's main shareholder, Carl H. Lindner, is Penn Central's chairman and chief executive officer.
