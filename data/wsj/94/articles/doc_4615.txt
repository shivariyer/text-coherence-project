Broken Hill Proprietary Co. has presented Canadian environmental authorities with a plan to spend about 500 million Canadian dollars (US$374.1 million) developing a diamond mine, if tests at a site near the Arctic Circle continue to be favorable.
Bruce Turner, the Australian mining concern's manager for the diamond project, said company plans to start construction next year and to be producing diamonds in 1997.
Mr. Turner said a firm decision won't be made until a feasibility study is finished, probably in August, and work can't be done until the company gets environmental approvals.
However, he said he is "optimistic" that the mine will be developed on schedule.
"We are serious.
We're spending lots of money," he said.
The project, near Lac de Gras in Canada's Northwest Territories, would be the country's first diamond mine.
In preliminary small samples, Broken Hill has discovered diamonds of good size, quality and color.
John Todd, Northwest Territories Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, said in a recent statement in the territories' government legislature that the proposed mine would process more ore than all other mines presently operating in the mineral-rich Canadian territory.
He said Broken Hill is "pursuing an aggressive schedule" for developing the mine.
The Lac de Gras diamond prospect is owned 51% by Broken Hill and 29% by Dia Met Minerals Ltd., Kelowna, British Columbia.
Private investors, including the discoverer of the prospect, Charles Fipke, also hold stakes in the project.
Separately, Dia Met said it is being sued by geologist Stewart Blusson over ownership of additional diamond prospects near the proposed mine site.
Dia Met said its "core claims" in the Lac de Gras region aren't affected by the suit, filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.
