Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is prepared to issue rules governing conversion of certain mutual savings banks to stockholder institutions.
Andrew Hove, FDIC acting chairman, on Friday dispelled any remaining doubts about his agency's power to issue such rules.
Mr. Hove said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee that the regulatory agency has authority to issue rules governing such conversions, similar to powers held by the Office of Thrift Supervision.
There had been some doubt about who had authority, the FDIC or state regulators, to set rules for such conversions.
The FDIC late last month proposed only guidelines, aimed at preventing insiders from profiting excessively at the expense of depositors in conversions.
It didn't take stronger action because its attorneys voiced doubts that it had OTS-style authority to regulate conversions.
The FDIC has since adopted interim rules to curb insider-conversion windfalls, saying it will consider OTS-type regulations.
The FDIC oversees state-chartered savings banks.
However, because it didn't have conversion rules, often-weak state regulations prevailed.
The OTS supervises federally chartered and state-chartered thrifts, and federally chartered savings banks.
