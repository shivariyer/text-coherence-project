Georgia-Pacific Corp., still grappling with low pulp prices, reported a loss for both the fourth quarter and the year.
For the quarter, the Atlanta forest-products concern reported a $36 million loss, or 41 cents a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $104 million, or $1.21 a share.
The latest quarter includes a $26 million charge related to an employee-compensation program.
Sales rose to $3.2 billion from $2.91 billion a year ago.
The quarterly loss was attributed partly to downtime at several major pulp and paper plants caused by a combination of factors, including equipment repairs and continuing slack demand, according to a spokeswoman.
For the year, Georgia-Pacific reported a loss of $34 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with a 1992 loss of $124 million, or $1.43 a share.
