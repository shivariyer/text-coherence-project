British leisure company Granada Group PLC said it has received acceptances for its bid for LWT Holdings PLC amounting to 40.33% of the company.
Granada already owned 17.51%, so it now holds 57.84% of the television company.
In a statement, Granada Chairman Alex Bernstein said: "We are obviously delighted that our offer has been accepted . . . we now look forward to the new, enlarged television division becoming a major force in the industry, not only in the U.K. but also overseas."
Analysts had widely expected Granada to emerge the winner in the hostile-takeover battle.
They felt that once Mercury Asset Management Group PLC Thursday accepted Granada's offer, LWT's fate was sealed.
Fund manager Mercury held a 14.2% stake in LWT and also had 16% holding in Granada.
LWT has yet to make an official statement on the result of Granada's offer.
