AB Astra said its earnings rose 20% in the fourth quarter.
And although the rate of profit growth was slower than recent currency-driven quarterly gains, it still kept the Swedish concern among the world's fastest growing drug companies.
In the fourth quarter, pretax profit climbed to 2.04 billion kronor ($255.8 million) from 1.7 billion kronor as sales jumped 50% to 6.52 billion kronor.
Astra's sales surge was fueled by antiulcer drug Losec and antiasthma medicine Pulmicort.
Chief Executive Hakan Mogren predicted that Astra's sales will continue to rise faster than the global pharmaceutical market.
But sales and profit growth this year won't match heady levels of 1993.
