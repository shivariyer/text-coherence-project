Spain's state-run electricity company Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA, or Endesa, said its consolidated net income rose 9.9% in 1993 to 116.81 billion pesetas ($819 million) from 106.30 billion pesetas in 1992.
Weakness of electricity demand in the first 10 months of 1993 hurt Madrid-based Endesa, which noted total demand in the sector crept only 0.1% higher during the year.
Meanwhile, low hydraulic production, due to the drought that parched much of Spain until the autumn of 1993, forced Endesa to switch to more costly coal and fossil-fuel powered methods of production, the company noted.
Consolidated revenue rose 4.7% during 1993 to 752.55 billion pesetas from 719.05 billion pesetas in 1992, while operating costs rose 5.1% to 507.72 billion pesetas from 483.25 billion pesetas in 1992.
