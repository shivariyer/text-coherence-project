Phillips & Jacobs Inc. and Momentum Corp. announced an agreement in principle to merge, combining two distributors of equipment and supplies for the printing industry with projected 1994 sales of about $360 million.
The transaction will give Phillips & Jacobs stockholders one share in the combined company for each of their shares.
Holders of Momentum, Bellvue, Wash., will get 0.71 shares of stock in the new entity for each of their shares.
There are about 4.1 million Phillips & Jacobs shares outstanding and about 3.4 million Momentum shares.
In over-the-counter trading Friday, Momentum shares declined $3.75, or 29%, to $9.25.
Phillips & Jacobs shares rose 12.5 cents to $12.50.
Ken Salmon, an analyst at C.L. King & Associates, in Albany, N.Y., speculated that Momentum stockholders were disappointed by the exchange rate in the merger.
After the close of trading, however, Momentum reported a net loss of $664,000, or 19 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with net income of $327,000, or nine cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales declined slightly to $28.3 million from $28.5 million, which the company attributed largely to the weak economy on the West Coast.
James Mullan, Phillips & Jacobs's chief executive officer, said the deal will allow the two distributors to have nationwide coverage.
He will keep that title in the new company.
John Goddard, Momentum's chief executive officer, will become executive vice president, Mr. Mullan said.
The two companies will operate as subsidiaries or divisions of the new parent company.
