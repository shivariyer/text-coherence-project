Ronald J. Ritchie, president and chief operating officer of this electronics concern, resigned.
The company said Mr. Ritchie, 53 years old, who was also a board member, was unable for personal reasons to move permanently to Boston, headquarters of Computer Products' largest business, Power Conversion.
Mr. Ritchie, who joined Computer Products in 1992, couldn't be reached for a comment.
The company said it doesn't plan to fill Mr. Ritchie's positions.
Instead, directors of each business unit will report to John N. Lemasters, chairman and chief executive officer.
