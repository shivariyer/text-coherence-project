Titan Corp. said it will receive a $10 million payment from the Navy after resolving a dispute over the company's contract to provide a system to link ships and submarines by satellite.
The electronics concern said it expects payment within 30 days.
Titan declared a $10 million loss last year that was related largely to the contract.
A spokeswoman said Titan is evaluating how it will account for the payment.
