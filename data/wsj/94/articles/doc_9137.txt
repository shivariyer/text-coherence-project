TSX Corp. said it reached agreement with its long-term lender, subject to conditions, to restructure its existing debt.
Terms call for the El Paso, Texas, electronics concern to pay its lender $10 million in cash, and issue $6.9 million in par value non-convertible preferred stock.
The preferred will be redeemable on the ninth anniversary of its issue and won't pay or accrue dividends.
TSX also will issue about 80,000 shares of common stock to the lender.
To fund the $10 million payment, TSX said it reached agreement for a $10 million bridge loan, subject to certain conditions, from Magten Asset Management Corp.
The loan bears interest at a variable rate, payable quarterly, and maturing one year from date of issue.
The Magten client accounts providing the loan will receive 300,000 shares of common stock and 300,000 Series A warrants.
Subject to various approvals, TSX said it expects to complete all transactions by mid-February.
Harold C. Tamburro, chief financial officer, said the restructuring will immediately reduce interest costs by $1 million a year and reduce cash outlays by $4.5 million a year.
