Royal Dutch/Shell Group reported a sharp drop in fourth-quarter net income, a result that analysts found uninspiring and somewhat worse than expected.
The Anglo-Dutch oil giant said current-cost net income -- dragged down by restructuring charges, declining oil prices and losses from chemicals operations -- fell 18% to #776 million ($1.15 billion) in the fourth quarter from #945 million a year earlier.
Net income for the year rose 3% to #3.23 billion from #3.12 billion in 1992.
The company was gloomy about oil-price prospects and said the outlook for the chemical sector depends on demand growth.
Shell's historic-cost net income, which reflects the financial effects of holding oil inventory, dropped 28% to #671 million in the quarter from #928 million a year earlier.
For the year, historic-cost net income fell 2% to #3 billion from #3.1 billion in 1992.
Analysts said that without extraordinary items, Shell's current-cost profit showed an increase, though this fell short of their expectations.
Philip Morgan, an analyst at Paribas in London, reckoned that after stripping out the effect of currency changes and exceptional items, Royal Dutch/Shell's fourth-quarter 1993 current-cost profit would have risen to #848 million from #781 million a year earlier.
"But it's #100 million short of what I was looking for," he said, adding that he was "mildly disappointed."
Shell took a charge of #147 million for restructuring operations in the fourth quarter, bringing the total restructuring charges for the year to #496 million.
Despite this, Royal Dutch/Shell is "having difficulty getting its profitability up," said Fergus MacLeod, an analyst at Natwest Markets in Edinburgh, Scotland.
He said he has Shell shares on short-term hold, "but long-term, the company looks like an underperformer."
He cited Exxon Corp. and British Petroleum Co. as better bets.
