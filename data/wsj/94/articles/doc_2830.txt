Diversified Communications Industries Ltd. said it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and for all of 1993 because of "accounting adjustments" uncovered in the company's year-end audit.
The West Palm Beach, Fla., holding company, with interests in telecommunications, also said its chief financial officer, James O'Donnell, had departed, and named its chairman, Joseph F. Bradway Jr., as acting finance chief.
Mr. O'Donnell, reached at his home, said he resigned Feb. 3 and stayed on with the company though last Friday.
He declined to discuss his departure.
Mr. Bradway couldn't be reached for comment.
Diversified said it couldn't quantify the losses, but will report its results when the audit is completed in late March.
The company said preliminary audit results disclosed "timing adjustments" related to revenue recognition; underaccruals for insurance, and a tax liability related to a former unit.
