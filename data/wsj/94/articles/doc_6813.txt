Standard & Poor's Corp. raised its ratings on Bally Manufacturing Corp.'s $1.2 billion in debt, citing the gambling and health-club concern's lower near-term obligations, better liquidity and strong casino results.
The rating concern said that while Bally's consolidated debt leverage remains high, completion of a number of corporate refinancings "has resulted in minimal debt maturities over the next few years."
The refinancings, coupled with debt issued last year by the Chicago-based company's Bally's Casino Holding unit, have "substantially" improved the parent's liquidity and reduced earlier concerns about its ability to meet sinking-fund requirements on certain debt issues, the rating concern said.
S&P said Bally's gambling operations "have performed quite well," but that operations at Bally's Health & Tennis unit "continue to suffer from a heavy debt burden and high operating leases."
Bally Manufacturing's subordinated debt was raised to single-B-plus from single-B, as were senior subordinated notes issued by Bally's Health & Tennis and senior discount notes issued by Bally's Casino Holdings.
S&P also raised its rating on first mortgage notes issued by Bally Park Place Funding Inc. to double-B from double-B-minus.
