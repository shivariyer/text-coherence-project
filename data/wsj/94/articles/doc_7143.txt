Disposable personal income rose 0.5% in December from November, matching spending gains during the last month of the year, the Commerce Department said.
Analysts said the data, which have been adjusted for inflation, suggest that the improving labor market is helping to lift the incomes and spending habits of Americans.
Still, Americans were worse off in 1993 in terms of income gains than they were in 1992.
With the effects of inflation stripped away, incomes rose 1.9% last year, after increasing 2.9% in 1992.
The Commerce Department said the slowdown in personal income growth largely reflected the fact that many Americans -- in an effort to avoid higher taxes -- shifted bonus payments that ordinarily would have been received last year to late 1992.
If these payments hadn't been accelerated, the gap between the two years would have been narrower.
Without taking into account price increases, disposable income rose 0.6% in December, compared with 0.5% the month before.
For the year, disposable income rose 4.6%, compared with 6.4% in 1992.
Spending increased 3.3% in 1993, adjusted for inflation, compared with 2.6% in 1992.
Most of the increased spending during the year came from purchases of durable goods such as cars and furniture.
Nondurable purchasing was weak.
For December, the savings rate rose to 4.2% from 4.1% the month before.
But for the year, the savings rate slipped to 4% from 5.3% in 1992.
Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on personal income.
The figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates in trillions of dollars.
