Hanson Industries, New York, the U.S. arm of British conglomerate Hanson PLC, said it completed the sale of Hanson Office Products, Whippany, N.J., to Corporate Express, a Denver privately held contract stationer, for $162.5 million.
Separately, another Hanson Industries unit, Quantum Chemical Co., said it will permanently close its Clinton, Mass., plastics compounding plant.
The shutdown, with the loss of all 61 positions at the plant, is expected to be completed within the next nine months.
Quantum, based in Cincinnati, said that it is discontinuing unprofitable product lines and that the remaining product lines will be produced at other Quantum compounding facilities, resulting in an annual cost saving of $2.5 million.
