FastComm Communications Corp. said a stockbroker inadvertently notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that a FastComm executive planned to sell shares in the company.
FastComm said the executive, Vice President Charles Deslaurier, had placed his stock certificates with the broker for safe keeping only.
The broker mistakenly notified the SEC that Mr. Deslaurier planned to sell stock, FastComm said, a procedure required when a company insider plans to dispose of securities in the company.
The telecommunications-equipment maker said Mr. Deslaurier would file an amendment with the SEC revoking the erroneous filing.
