Metricom Inc., a small but innovative wireless-communications concern, said Microsoft Corp. agreed to buy up to a 2% stake in Metricom for roughly $5 million.
Metricom in Los Gatos, Calif., said Microsoft, the software giant in Redmond, Wash., will purchase 200,000 shares of Metricom.
Microsoft also agreed to buy warrants covering 75,000 shares.
The price of the common shares will be based on the eventual price set for Metricom's recently announced public offering, of 2.2 million shares.
The exercise price of the warrants is $37.50.
Metricom closed yesterday at $27.50 a share, up $1.50, or 5.8% on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Metricom has about 9.8 million shares outstanding now.
Microsoft's investment, though small, is a boost for Metricom, which is developing high-performance wireless-networking technology that it says is much cheaper than currently available systems.
Many analysts think the market for such technology eventually could be huge.
