Ohio insurance regulators are investigating whether Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. violated state insurance regulations when the company won an exclusive contract to sell life insurance to state employees.
The matter is separate from an 18-state investigation into MetLife's methods of selling life insurance to individuals.
Still, it adds to the questions about the marketing practices of the big life insurer.
The Ohio investigation centers on MetLife's hiring in 1987 of an insurance broker, Asher Schapiro, to lobby the state for the group insurance contract.
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Schapiro became a consultant for the state to recommend which company should get the contract.
MetLife won the contract in the fall of 1987.
"We're investigating whether Met might have violated insurance laws," said David Randall, deputy insurance superindendent for Ohio.
Mr. Schapiro is also being investigated.
New York-based MetLife denied any wrongdoing and said it is cooperating with the state investigation.
John Dowd, the attorney for Mr. Schapiro, said his client didn't violate any laws.
Beginning in 1986, Ohio began to look into selecting a group life insurance contract for 60,000 government employees.
Employees would pay for the insurance themselves, but they would get a better deal through the program than if they bought insurance on their own.
MetLife agreed to pay Mr. Schapiro, a broker from Teaneck, N.J., $350,000 if it won the contract.
Mr. Schapiro then arranged to pay former Ohio Democratic party chairman Paul Tipps $100,000 to lobby the state.
Even though the state knew Mr. Schapiro had been hired by MetLife, it asked the broker to evaluate contract proposals and select which insurance company the state should hire.
Mr. Schapiro recommended MetLife.
Shortly after MetLife got word that it won, the company sent Mr. Schapiro a check for $350,000.
Mr. Dowd, Mr. Schapiro's attorney, said the money wasn't a fee, but payment to reimburse Mr. Schapiro for expenses in setting up the insurance program.
He added that Mr. Schapiro was never compensated by the state.
Instead, Mr. Schapiro's compensation would come solely from commissions on the sale of life insurance by MetLife.
According to Mr. Dowd, the entire process was above board.
He said Mr. Schapiro told the state from the beginning that he would probably select MetLife for the contract because it was the only company with the ability to handle such a contract.
Scott Solsman, benefits administrator with the Ohio Department of Administrative Service, confirmed that the state knew about Mr. Schapiro's relationship with MetLife, but that the state refused to sever its ties to him.
In a memo Mr. Solsman wrote to his boss in 1987, Mr. Solsman mentioned his concern about a "quid pro quo arrangement" between MetLife and Mr. Schapiro's company.
Mr. Schapiro has been in the spotlight before.
In 1992, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Michigan indicted Mr. Schapiro, accusing him of paying $98,000 to a former employee of American Motors Corp. and three others to sell insurance to the car maker's employees.
Mr. Schapiro was acquitted.
Details about the MetLife contract in Ohio came out in a lawsuit against MetLife brought by a Kentucky insurance broker, Terry Havens.
In the case in Manhattan federal court, Mr. Havens charges that the company owes him a commission for a contract it won to sell insurance to state employees in Illinois.
MetLife declined comment because the litigation is pending.
Documents in the case have been sealed at request of the company.
