Westmoreland Coal Co., Philadelphia, said it will close its Hampton Division in Boone County, W.Va., which includes a coal mine, a machine shop and a preparation plant.
The division, which will lay off 133 workers, will be closed on April 29.
The company cited the loss of a major above-market contract and the continuing low price of coal for its decision.
