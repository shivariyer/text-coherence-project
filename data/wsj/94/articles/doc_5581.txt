INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE: Invests at least 65% of long-term bond portfolio in issues of the U.S. Government and Federal agencies; excludes U.S. Treasury-only price
MUTUAL FUND SCORECARDS for U.S. Government bond funds, printed Wednesday, and for Ginnie Mae funds, printed Thursday, showed total return performance since Dec. 31, 1992, rather than Dec. 31, 1993, due to a miscalculation by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
The total return calculations in both Scorecards for one month, 12 months and five years were correct, and all calculations were based on periods ending Jan. 31, 1994.
