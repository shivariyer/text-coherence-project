Sequa Corp. posted a wider loss on lower sales for both the fourth quarter and the year, reflecting restructuring charges and operating losses at a unit.
Sequa posted a fourth-quarter loss of $18.8 million, or $2.03 a share, compared with a loss of $17.7 million, or $1.93 cents a share, for the year-ago period.
Revenue declined 3% to $450.1 million.
For the year, the New York company reported a loss of $64 million, or $6.95 a share, compared with a loss of $11.1 million, or $1.49 a share.
Sequa's sales for 1993 fell to $1.7 billion, from $1.87 billion.
The aerospace and chemical concern said results reflect a federal investigation and subsequent restrictions that halted jet engine repair operations at Chromalloy Gas Turbine, Sequa's largest unit in Orangeburg, N.Y., and by a $25.6 million restructuring charge at that unit.
