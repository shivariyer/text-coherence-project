Anadarko Petroleum Corp. said a unit completed a discovery oil and natural-gas well in the Sahara Desert of Algeria.
The Houston oil and natural-gas exploration company said the El Merk East No. 1 well flowed about 8,100 barrels of oil and 82.5 million cubic feet of gas a day from four zones.
An Anadarko spokesman said the depths of those zones were confidential.
Anadarko said the well was drilled to a depth of 14,859 feet.
Anadarko Petroleum said its Anadarko Algeria Corp. operates the well and owns a 50% interest.
A unit of Lasmo PLC of the U.K. and a unit of Maersk Olie og Gas AS of Denmark each own a 25% interest.
Anadarko said its unit has a production-sharing agreement with Sonatrach, the Algerian oil and gas company that owns 10.2% of Anadarko Petroleum's common stock.
