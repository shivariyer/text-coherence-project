Universal Foods Corp. said its board has authorized the repurchase of as many as 2.5 million shares, or about 10%, of the company's common stock.
In a news release, the company said the shares may be repurchased over a number of years and used for a variety of corporate purposes.
Universal Foods repurchased 451,000 shares, or about 1.7%, of company stock outstanding, during the fourth quarter of 1993 and the first week in 1994; that depleted an authorized amount approved by the board in 1984.
