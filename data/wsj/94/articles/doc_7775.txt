American Greetings Corp. expects operating profit for the fiscal year ending Feb. 28 of about $1.75 a share to $1.76 a share, Henry Lowenthal, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said.
The greeting cards concern "will meet the consensus Wall Street earnings expectations" for fiscal 1994, Mr. Lowenthal said in an interview.
He defined the consensus as "in the area of $1.75 to $1.76 a share."
That estimate excludes an extraordinary charge of 23 cents a share for cumulative effect of changes in accounting for postretirement benefits and income taxes, which was taken in the first quarter.
In fiscal 1993, Cleveland-based American Greetings earned $112.3 million, or $1.55 a share, after adjustment for a 2-for-1 stock split last December.
Revenue totaled $1.69 billion.
Revenue in fiscal 1994 probably will rise between 5% and 6%, Mr. Lowenthal said.
Sales of greeting cards in the U.S., the company's largest business, will grow by 6% to 8% this year, mainly because of higher average prices, he added.
