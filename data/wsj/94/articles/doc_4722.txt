The Clinton administration, responding to pressure from Western interests, has scaled back its proposed increase in grazing fees.
A regulation currently being readied by the Interior Department would propose raising the monthly fee to $2.77 in the first year, $3.50 in the second and $3.96 in the third year.
The fees are expressed in terms of "animal units" -- forage for a cow and a calf or for five sheep.
The current fee is $1.86.
Details of the grazing-fee plan appeared in Friday's Washington Post.
An Interior Department official said the numbers weren't yet finalized, but appeared unlikely to change.
Last August, the Interior Department proposed raising grazing fees to $4.28.
But that plan met with strong resistance in the Senate, and a subsequent legislative compromise failed to overcome a filibuster by Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.).
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said last fall that he would reintroduce his original grazing-fee plan but delayed action in deference to Western Democratic governors such as Colorado's Roy Romer, who sought changes.
Since then, administration officials have increasingly played down the importance of the grazing-fee increase, emphasizing instead land-management reforms that would be included in the package.
Under the new plan, ranchers who followed certain land-management practices wouldn't have to pay the full $3.96 fee.
Instead, starting in the third year of the program they would be eligible for a 30% discount that would lower their grazing fee back to $2.77.
