E.W. Scripps Co. agreed to acquire one of the country's largest independent producers of cable-television programming, as it seeks to become a key provider of entertainment services.
Scripps, which owns significant newspaper and cable operations, said it reached an agreement in principle to acquire closely held Bagwell Communications/Cinetel Productions from its founder and chairman, Ross K. Bagwell Sr.
Terms weren't disclosed, but the eventual acquisition price is expected to be between $15 and $20 million.
Despite the relatively small size of the acquisition, the move bolsters Scripps's efforts in recent months to diversify beyond newspapers into nonprint information and entertainment services.
Last summer, Scripps announced plans to sign on eight million subscribers for its 24-hour Home & Garden Television Network cable channel, to be launched this year.
It also established a Hollywood production company, Scripps Howard Productions, to make TV movies and miniseries.
"This is a major statement that our future is in the ownership, production and sales of information and entertainment," said Ken Lowe, president of the Home & Garden Television Network, in an interview.
But, he added, "we're not moving away from print."
Scripps said the Bagwell/Cinetel facility in Knoxville, Tenn., will become the main production center for the Home & Garden network, and eliminate the need for the company to build, as previously planned, a separate production facility.
The Cinetel operations produced network series and prime-time specials for the Nashville Network, Arts & Entertainment, the Discovery Channel, Nickelodeon and other cable networks in 1993.
Similar production is expected to continue.
