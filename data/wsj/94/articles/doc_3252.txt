CS First Boston has hired away one of Bankers Trust New York Corp.'s key capital-markets executives, Mark Patterson, to head its reorganized capital-markets business.
Mr. Patterson, 42 years old, will be in charge of CS First Boston's Leveraged Finance Group, which unites its emerging-markets, structured-financing and junkbond divisions.
Mr. Patterson's departure is a blow to Bankers Trust and its recent attempts to beef up its bond business.
At Bankers Trust, Mr. Patterson was a managing director in charge of the bank's junk-bond and high-grade bond divisions, which expanded broadly under his management.
CS First Boston is the brokerage unit of CS Holding AG, which also controls Swiss bank Credit Suisse.
Part of Mr. Patterson's job, the company said, will be to work as a liaison for the Leveraged Finance Group between Credit Suisse and CS First Boston, which will have access to the bank's capital in making loans and structuring corporate financings.
CS First Boston President Allen Wheat, himself a former a Bankers Trust executive, said the newly combined department "brings together several businesses with many fundamentals in common into a single group which will deliver products specifically developed for clients in these significant growth areas."
