Germany's largest auto maker, Volkswagen AG, reported that its consolidated loss for 1993 was 1.94 billion marks ($1.15 billion), narrower than the company had forecast.
VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech earlier had predicted that the company would likely post a loss for the year of as much as 2.3 billion marks.
In 1992, the group posted a slim profit of 147 million marks.
Despite the huge loss, the company's board of supervisors decided to maintain the 1993 dividend unchanged from its 1992 level of two marks.
Sales by VW slumped 10% to 76.59 billion marks in 1993 from 85.40 billion marks a year earlier as the deep recession in Germany and Europe reduced its market.
In a move that may affect VW's future competitiveness, the company slashed its investment program by 47% to 4.84 billion marks in 1993 from 9.25 billion marks.
