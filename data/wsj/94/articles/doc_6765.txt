Exploration Co. of Louisiana said it obtained a $29.2 million loan from International Nederlanden (U.S.) Capital Corp.
The oil and natural-gas exploration company said the new loan, which requires interest-only payments for 18 months, replaced a previous bank loan.
Marsden W. Miller Jr., chairman, said that obtaining the new loan completed the first phase of the company's capital reorganization.
Mr. Miller said this will allow the company to drill three wells offshore China during the next 15 months and to continue developing the Berry R. Cox Field in South Texas.
