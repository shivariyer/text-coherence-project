JOHN L. SPRAGUE was named a director of California Micro Devices Corp., a maker of thin-film silicon-based integrated circuits.
He retired in 1987 as chief executive officer of a company his father founded, Sprague Electric Co., primarily a maker of capacitors.
In Tuesday's Who's News column, California Micro was misidentified as a semiconductor concern and Mr. Sprague as Sprague Electric's founder.
