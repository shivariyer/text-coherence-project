Cornerstone Imaging Inc. said it expects to report that fourth-quarter earnings grew nearly five-fold to between $1.55 million and $1.65 million, or 21 cents to 22 cents a share, reflecting vigorous demand for its document-imaging equipment.
The estimated results exceed analysts' expectations of 19 cents to 20 cents a share, said Thomas van Overbeek, president and chief executive officer.
Actual results for the period will be released Feb. 8.
Net income was $323,000, or six cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales in the quarter, it is estimated, doubled to between $14.5 million and $15 million, up from $7.4 million a year earlier, Mr. van Overbeek said.
Document-image processing, or the use of a computer for paperwork that has been converted to digitized computer data, is a fast-growing business.
Cornerstone is benefiting through its sale of peripheral equipment for such systems, including high-resolution monitors, software and control systems.
