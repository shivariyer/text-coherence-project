A fugitive since 1991, the former managing director of Merrill Lynch & Co.'s London office surrendered to federal authorities in New York and pleaded guilty to an inside-trading charge.
Nahum Vaskevitch, who has lived in Israel since being fired by Merrill Lynch in March 1987 because of alleged insider trading, pleaded guilty in federal district court in Manhattan to one count of conspiracy to trade on inside information.
He also agreed to pay about $2.8 million to settle similar civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The charges relate to six deals in the mid-1980s involving Merrill clients, including W.R. Grace & Co.'s sale of Herman's Sporting Goods to Dee Corp., according to federal prosecutors in New York.
Mr. Vaskevitch, 45 years old, was indicted in March 1991.
He fled from authorities four months later after being arrested and released in Cyprus.
He couldn't be extradicted because neither Cyprus nor Israel has an extradition treaty with the U.S. for white-collar crime.
Mr. Vaskevitch faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy charge.
"He came back for the purpose of putting all of this behind him," said his attorney, Abraham Sofaer of the Washington, D.C., firm Hughes, Hubbard & Reed.
