Parallel Petroleum Corp. said its fourth Canyon Reef discovery well, the Phillips No. 1, flowed at a rate of 580 barrels of oil and 1.49 million cubic feet of natural gas daily from a depth of about 9,000 feet.
The oil and natural gas company said it expects the well to produce 130 barrels of oil and about 460 thousand cubic feet of natural gas a day.
Parallel owns a 60% working interest in the well, which is in the Horseshoe Atoll area of Howard County, Texas.
Five closely held companies own the remaining 40% interest.
