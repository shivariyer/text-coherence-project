Rea Gold Corp. said it agreed to issue 24.1 million Canadian dollars (US$17.8 million) of special warrants through a private placement.
The Vancouver, British Columbia, mining company said the 13.8 million special warrants will be priced at C$1.75 (US$1.29) each.
Each warrant will be exchangeable for one common share and half a share-purchase warrant.
Each share-purchase warrant will be exercisable for one common share at C$2 until Sept 30, 1995, the company added.
Rea closed at $1.50, up 12.5 cents, or 9.1%, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Rea's treasurer and chief financial officer, Rodney Shier, said proceeds will be used to acquire Mount Hamilton Mining Co., Ely, Nev., and to put its only significant asset, a Nevada gold-mining project, into production.
