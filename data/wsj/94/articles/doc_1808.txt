Stelco Inc. said investors exercised 22.2 million warrants issued in 1991, raising 125 million Canadian dollars (US$91.6 million) for the steel producer.
The warrants, which expired Tuesday, entitled the holder to purchase one Series A common share for C$5.625.
Those shares closed at C$9.875 Tuesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Stelco has about 103 million shares outstanding, including those issued from the warrants.
A Stelco official said the company will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
