MCI AGREED TO PAY $1.3 billion for a 17% stake in Nextel, challenging rival efforts by AT&T and the Baby Bells to create a national cellular telephone service.
Ever since AT&T moved last year to buy McCaw, MCI has sought a cellular partner and it aims to help Nextel build a nationwide digital cellular network in two years.
