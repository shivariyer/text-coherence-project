Consumer confidence appears to have picked up a bit toward the end of February, suggesting the winter blues may be over.
The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 93.2 in the later half of this month from an early February reading of 92.9, according to market participants who saw the report.
Consumer confidence is still down a bit from its January reading of 94.3.
The Michigan index also indicates that consumers are more optimistic about inflation than they were last summer.
This finding is noteworthy given that the bond markets have been edgy recently about the prospects of higher inflation.
"It just goes to show that inflation isn't really a Main Street concern right now.
It's a Wall Street concern," said Morgan Stanley economist Stephen Roach.
A consumer-confidence measure issued by the Conference Board in New York also showed Americans' mood was slightly worse than in January.
The decline was attributed to cold, slushy winter weather.
Some analysts said higher interest rates may have also played a part.
But the pickup in the University of Michigan's index at the end of the month, as the weather cleared and temperatures rose in many regions of the country, suggests that the consumers were mainly affected by the foul weather.
