Tribune Co.'s Tribune Entertainment plans an assault on the country-music entertainment marketplace with a weekly syndicated television show called "The Road" and a weekly radio program next fall.
Tribune also plans related ventures, including pay-per-view cable specials and home video releases.
In addition, over a period of three to four years, the company expects to develop a chain of country-music clubs, concerts and a multimedia direct marketing operation, said Don Hacker, Tribune Entertainment president and chief executive.
The first year's investment in the events will be about $10 million, Mr. Hacker said.
"The Road," to be produced by Los Angeles-based High Five Productions, will follow country artists in concert, back stage and on the road, "in a way that hasn't been done," Mr. Hacker said.
It will be carried by Tribune's seven television stations.
