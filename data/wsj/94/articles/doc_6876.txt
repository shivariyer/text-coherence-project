Walt Disney Co. said it tentatively agreed to spend $29 million to restore and reopen the historic New Amsterdam Theater on West 42nd Street in New York.
The renovation, which governmment officials hope will speed plans to revitalize the 42nd Street entertainment district, will be financed by an $8 million Disney investment and a $21 million government loan to the company, a Disney spokesman said.
An agreement for the financing was unveiled by Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Mr. Eisner said the move by the Burbank, Calif., company marks its expanding commitment to live entertainment.
The company already is involved in another major New York live-entertainment venture, with its premiere of "Beauty and The Beast the Musical" at the Palace Theater scheduled for April 7.
