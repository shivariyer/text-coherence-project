Stone Energy Corp. said it completed a natural-gas discovery well off the coast of Louisiana.
The oil and natural-gas company said its State Lease 14430 No. 1 well tested at a rate of 6.1 million cubic feet of natural gas a day from a horizontal line about 400 feet long at a vertical depth of 2,290 feet.
Stone Energy, which operates the well and owns a 100% working interest in it, said it expects to place the well on production in June.
