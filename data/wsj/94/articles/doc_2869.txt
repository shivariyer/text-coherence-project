One of Japan's biggest banks took a step toward ending its bad debt woes, but analysts say resolution for the banking industry as a whole is still a long way off.
Sakura Bank Ltd. announced that it will issue 100 billion yen ($945 million) in preference shares, a type of high-yielding stock.
Other large Japanese commercial banks are expected later this year to issue their own preferred shares, which were only recently allowed by the Ministry of Finance.
The shares, which must eventually be converted into regular stock, should increase Sakura's capital base, enabling the bank to increase business activities while writing down unrecoverable loans.
Sakura has acknowledged nonperforming loans totaling 1.463 trillion yen ($13.83 billion) as of last September, though analysts say the total amount is much higher.
Japan's 10 large commercial banks are thought to have at least 15 trillion yen in nonperforming loans, most of it from loans made to failed real-estate developers.
David Snoddy, analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd., called the preference shares "a modest plus" for Sakura.
"It's not a huge amount of money" relative to the bank's overall bad loans, he said, "but it's definitely a good thing" for Sakura.
It remains to be seen what the effect will be on the price of Sakura's ordinary shares, however.
As with other Japanese banks, many of Sakura's shares are held by the bank's regular borrowers.
Those borrowers may choose to dump their ordinary shares in favor of the higher-yielding preferred stock (the final dividend hasn't been determined yet).
