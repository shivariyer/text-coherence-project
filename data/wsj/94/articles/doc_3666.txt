Sara Lee Corp., expanding its presence in Mexico, agreed to a joint-venture investment in the Kir Alimentos meat-processing unit of AXA SA de CV of Monterrey, Mexico.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The venture, in which Sara Lee and AXA would each own 50%, would make and distribute various Sara Lee processed meats, a Sara Lee spokeswoman said.
Kir makes and markets hot dogs, luncheon meats, sausages and hams in Mexico.
Sara Lee already distributes baked goods as well as its L'eggs, Hanes and Playtex hosiery and intimate apparel in Mexico.
