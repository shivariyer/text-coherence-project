Hugoton Energy Corp. said a new discovery well in Haskell County, Kan., flowed in a test at the rate of three million cubic feet of gas and at least 200 barrels of oil a day at a depth of 5,500 feet.
Hugoton, the operator of the well, owns a 65% interest in it.
The company said the well is expected to begin production by March 1.
