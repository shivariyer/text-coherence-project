Aztec Manufacturing Co. said it expects earnings of 38 cents to 40 cents a share for its year ending Feb. 28, about double the year-earlier results.
For the year ended Feb. 28, 1993, the Crowley, Texas, electrical products concern reported net income of $1.1 million, or 20 cents a share, on sales of $30.8 million.
L.C. Martin, chairman, president and chief executive officer, told securities analysts in New York that the profit rise was due to the company's move into certain electrical products niche markets.
Mr. Martin also said he would ask Aztec's board to consider paying a cash dividend "at some level" near the end of the fiscal year.
Aztec paid a 2.5-cent-a-share quarterly dividend before suspending payments in mid-1993.
