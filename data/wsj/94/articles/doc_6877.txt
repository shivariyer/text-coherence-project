Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it upgraded the rating of this drugstore chain operator's $140 million 9.125% senior unsecured notes due 2000 to Ba-1 from Ba-3.
Moody's said "the rating adjustment reflects the benefit realized from the release of security against the bank group" as well as continued improvements in the operating performance and the debt-servicing capabilities of the company.
However, these factors are somewhat offset by the continuing pressure on gross margins and other items, the ratings agency said.
