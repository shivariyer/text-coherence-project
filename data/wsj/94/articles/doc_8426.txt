Canada's Moore Corp. said it plans to take a pretax charge of $210 million to cover the costs of closing additional manufacturing plants and streamlining its order-management system.
Moore, a major provider world-wide of business forms, said it expects "substantial" benefit from the proposed changes, assuming the U.S. economy continues to recover.
The Toronto-based company said the benefits will come in the form of lower expenses and improved gross margins.
The planned write-down, which equals $155 million after tax, or $1.55 a share, will result in a loss for 1993, Moore said.
However, a "strong balance sheet and adequate cash resources" are sufficient to continue to fund 1994 capital spending and to maintain the dividend, it said.
Moore its plan will result in a reduction of about 3,000 jobs, or 13% of its worldwide work force.
The planned charges relate to businesses in all geographic regions in which Moore operates, the company said.
Revenue has declined in recent years as Moore's core business-forms operations faced pressure from the growing use of electronic communications.
To replace declining revenue from its business-forms division, Moore has turned to other, faster-growing activities.
For instance it now provides direct marketing services, data management and document storage and retrieval.
Moore has previously taken write-downs in relation to its underperforming European business.
The company said its results in Europe, although improving, are still "unacceptable."
