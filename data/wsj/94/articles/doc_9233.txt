Sharply lower bond prices and profit-taking trimmed more of the gains made by stocks this year in fairly quiet trading.
Yesterday's session was the third straight day of givebacks after equities rallied for six consecutive sessions to start off 1994, cruising to records four times.
But losses were modest yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6.20 points to 3842.43.
Broader indexes also fell.
The Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index lost 1.70 points to 472.47, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gave up 0.64 point to 261.73.
Meanwhile, on the Nasdaq Stock Market, its Composite Index reversed mild weakness and climbed 0.94 point to 787.81, breaking through its previous record of 787.42 set Oct. 15.
Big Board decliners led advancers, 1,142 to 936.
Volume was a slim 277,886,000 shares, compared with 309,893,000 Wednesday.
John J. Schraff, an equity trader at Daiwa Securities America, said investors were thrown a bit by the bond market declines as "they tried to figure out which way they're going to go from here."
But he said buyers are beginning to trickle back into the market after disappearing in the previous three days.
Likewise, Joseph J. McAlinden, director of research at Dillon Read & Co., said he thinks the "profit-taking has just about run its course," and the Dow Jones industrials will reach a record again before the end of the month.
Mr. McAlinden added that the steady stream of good economic news and the focus on fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports, which are expected to be strong, will catapult two groups into favor over the coming weeks: cyclical stocks of all capitalization levels and small-company issues.
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index continued its string of higher moves, rising 0.19 point to 480.06.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average rose to a high, climbing 2.57 to 1824.08.
AMR Corp. increased 1 3/4 to 71 3/4; Delta Air Lines gained 1 to 57 3/8, and Roadway Services Inc. tacked on 1 to 63 1/2 on Nasdaq.
The big three U.S. auto makers got a boost from news that analysts forecast fourth-quarter profits for the trio.
Ford Motor inched up 3/8 to 67 7/8; General Motors added 1 to 60 1/4, and Chrysler, which is expected to lead the pack, improved 1 to 60.
Bank stocks were also in the limelight.
Citicorp topped the Big Board most actives list with about 5.6 million shares traded, up from average daily volume of 1.8 million.
The stock climbed 2 1/8 to 40 3/4 following a positive fourth-quarter and full-year earnings outlook as well as restructuring news.
In addition, Citicorp said it agreed in principle to sell its Quotron market data services business to Reuters Holdings Inc., which added 7/8 to 83.
J.P. Morgan & Co. gained 3/4 to 70 3/8.
The company said fourth-quarter net income of $1.92 a share surpassed analysts' expectations of $1.70 and the $1.10 earned in the year-earlier period.
Mellon Bank and Baltimore Bancorp rose on speculation that Mellon is considering buying the bank holding company.
Mellon declined to comment, though people close to Mellon said they don't know where the rumors are coming from.
Late yesterday, Baltimore Bancorp said it is in "preliminary discussions with several major bank holding companies regarding a possible sale of the company," but said Mellon isn't one of those companies.
Green Tree Financial jumped 2 to 54 1/4 after a rating upgrade from Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. to "strong buy" from "buy."
The brokerage firm also raised its 1994 earnings estimate to $4.55 a share from $4.30.
Bear Stearns Cos. gained 3/4 to 23 7/8.
The financial-services firm said second-quarter earnings rose to $1.05 a share from 52 cents a year earlier.
Wall Street had expected net income to come in at 78 cents.

Among losers, Quaker Oats sagged 3 3/8 to 66 after projecting a 15% to 20% decline in fiscal second-quarter earnings from the 77 cents a share in the year-earlier period.
Also, Goldman Sachs downgraded Quaker to "market performer" from "moderate outperformer," citing the disappointing forecast.
Nomi Ghez, an analyst at the brokerage firm, cut her fiscal 1994 and 1995 earnings estimates.
On Nasdaq, Oracle Corp. slid 2 3/4 to 32 1/4, reportedly amid profit-taking, the reduction of investment ratings, and earnings estimates as well as possible investor disappointment with the revenue stream from the company's multimedia pact with Bell Atlantic Corp., which fell 1/4 to 56 1/4 on the Big Board.
Oracle was the most-active Nasdaq stock with volume of 10.4 million shares, up from average daily turnover of 3.1 million.
