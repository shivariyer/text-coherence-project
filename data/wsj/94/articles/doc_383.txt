ROTATING EMMY: The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences voted to have its annual prime-time Emmy Awards telecast resume rotating among Capital Cities/ABC Inc., CBS Inc., General Electric Co.'s NBC and News Corp.'s Fox, beginning in 1995.
In February 1993, the Academy awarded exclusive rights to the telecast to ABC for four years, angering the competing networks, who boycotted last September's show.
