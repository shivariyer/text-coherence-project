After reading the Feb. 15 page-one article about the new pressures of academia, I was incensed.
It was not, however, because I am a frustrated professor trying to find a job.
It was because I attend the "unheralded" school you refer to, Western Carolina University.
Aside from what Prof. James Reynolds may have told you about our "unsophisticated student population and lack of funding," there are some other facts about this university that should be clarified.
Since we live in such a rural area, there are not many cultural activities to enhance our horizons.
However, we also do not have to deal with street gangs, daily murders, and other heinous crimes that go on in the larger metropolitan areas.
In fact, according to the FBI, WCU has the lowest crime rate of any university in the North Carolina system.
The tuition is low, but the quality is high.
We have a staggering ratio of professors with doctoral and terminal degrees (about 275) compared with the undergraduate and graduate student population (5,900).
There are few enough people in class that the professor comes to know each student by name and has time to consult with each student who wants extra attention out of class.
At WCU, we are not numbers.
We count as people, and I think that leads us to be more caring, reliable human beings.

Your article entitled "Young Professors Find Life in Academia Isn't What It Used to Be" describes Western Carolina University as "unheralded."
Anyone who has observed the service of this university to the community of Southern Atlantic states could not conclude that Western Carolina University is unheralded.
Its contributions in a variety of fields, from agribusiness to education, are exceptional.
As a center of learning, Western Carolina has formed a true partnership with the region and helped lift into economic viability an area not blessed with abundant salable resources.
For its teachers, alone, the school is prized.
