Program trading in the week ended March 11 accounted for 11.5%, or an average 36 million daily shares, of New York Stock Exchange volume.
Brokerage firms executed an additional 14.1 million daily shares of program trading away from the Big Board, mostly on foreign markets.
Program trading is the simultaneous purchase or sale of at least 15 different stocks with a total value of $1 million or more.
Of the program total on the Big Board, 26.3% involved stock-index arbitrage, down from 44.5% the prior week.
In this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
Some 59.8% of program trading was executed by firms for their customers, and 37.3% for their own accounts, or principal trading.
Another 2.9% was customer facilitation, in which firms use principal positions to facilitate customer trades.
Of the five most-active firms, Nomura Securities, Susquehanna and Cooper Neff executed all or most of their program trading for their own accounts, while J.P. Morgan and Salomon Brothers did most of their trading for customers.
The NYSE's program-trading report includes profiles of program activity whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves at least 50 points up or down within an hour.
On March 2, when the Dow fell 50 points by 9:50 a.m., the firms reporting the most program trading from 9:30 to 10:30 were Susquehanna, Kidder Peabody, Nomura Securities and First Boston.
