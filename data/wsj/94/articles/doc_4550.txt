General Motors Corp.
Chief Executive Officer John F. Smith Jr. said it is "getting prepared" to sell its National Car Rental unit.
Mr. Smith said that GM is reviewing its ownership of the car-rental company but isn't prepared to sell it yet.
However, Eric Feldstein, GM's assistant treasurer, said the auto maker "would consider an attractive and appropriate offer."
Mr. Feldstein said National Car Rental was "restored to profitability at the operating level" last year, and that GM is expecting further improvements this year.
GM's comments follow reports that the Big Three may be looking to sell their car-rental concerns.
The auto companies have cut back on unprofitable sales to rental-car companies and backed away from hefty discounts.
Chrysler Corp., which owns Snappy, Dollar and Thrifty car-rental companies, has said that it would consider offers.
Ford Motor Co., which is trying to increase its stake in Hertz Corp. to 54%, said it "intends to continue to be involved with Hertz."
GM is the sole owner of National Car Rental.
