Magma Copper Co. said it expects copper prices to reach $1 a pound by year's end and thinks 1995 will be "a very big year" for the mining company.
J. Burgess Winter, president and chief executive office, reiterated his belief that copper prices, currently at about 88 cents to 89 cents a pound, will rally to at least $1 a pound by year's end.
Mr. Winter also said he was comfortable with analysts' estimates for the first quarter, but the company's performance hinged on the market price of copper.
The analysts' consensus hovers around three cents a share for the first quarter, a figure that the company said it "would not have any problem beating" based on current conditions.
In the first quarter of 1993, Magma had net income of $276,000, or one cent a share, on sales of $194.6 million.
The company said rainfall in key Arizona mining regions reduced first-quarter earnings last year about $13 million.
Magma added that it was comfortable with an earnings estimate of 34 cents a share for 1994.
But the company cautioned that the estimate contains a wide range of earnings projections, linked to copper prices.
The company said bettering that estimate depends on a copper price at year end between 90 cents and $1 a pound.
Mr. Winter said the strengthening U.S. economy has increased demand for copper at home, but crucial export markets, especially in Western Europe and Japan, continue to suffer.
"But I believe things are starting to look up in some parts of Europe," Mr. Winter said.
Magma Copper, spun off from Newmont Mining Co. in 1988 has steadily been rebuilding its balance sheet.
The company's debt-to-equity ratio has tumbled from nearly 60% in 1988, to the mid-30% range.
Last week, Standard & Poor's Corp. upgraded the company's senior debt to triple-B-minus, the company's first investment-grade rating.
