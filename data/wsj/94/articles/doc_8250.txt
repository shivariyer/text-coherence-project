Inflation in the 12-nation European Union inched up to a provisional 3.3% in December from 3.2% in November.
But it was down from 3.6% in December 1992, the EU's statistics arm, Eurostat, said.
December inflation slowed in seven EU countries and remained unchanged in two EU states, compared with a year earlier.
The figures show that Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland, the U.K., France and Belgium meet the criteria for the move to a single currency, which stipulates annual inflation shouldn't be more than 1.5% above the average of the three lowest rates.
Two EU applicants, Finland and Norway, also meet the criteria with inflation rates of 1.5% and 1.8% respectively.
