Danskin Inc. said it will introduce a new line of golf and tennis apparel for women this fall.
The manufacturer of women's exercise and dance clothing and leg wear said the new line will be designed by Lisa Berger, formerly director of design at Ellesse USA Inc., a New York maker of sports apparel.
Danskin said the new line is a return to a market where it had "substantial" business in the 1970s.
