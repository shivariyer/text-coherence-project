RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. said it acquired Royal Food Products S.A., a leading regional producer of dry mixes in Tunisia.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The acquisition marks Nabisco's first Middle Eastern acquisition.
In June, the company opened a sales office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to direct its growing sales of U.S. exports in the region.
The acquisition "gives Nabisco International a manufacturing entry into an important region with outstanding growth potential," said H.F. "Jake" Powell, chairman and chief executive officer of Nabisco International, a unit of RJR Nabisco.
Founded in 1976, Royal Food produces a range of dry mixes that are exported throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa.
