Scientists at DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. said they developed a class of experimental AIDS drugs designed with a new type of computer-aided technology.
"We think it's one of the very first examples of new medicines developed by this new design method," said David Jackson, a leading researcher at DuPont Merck, which is a joint venture between DuPont Co., in Wilmington, Del., and Merck & Co., in Whitehouse Station, N.J. "Drug makers have been talking about using a more rational approach to drugmaking for years, and now the first generation of these drugs is emerging."
The new drugs block an enzyme called protease that the virus that causes AIDS needs to reproduce and spread from cell to cell.
About a half dozen companies have been racing after protease-blocking medicines since 1987, but until recently most of them failed to create drug molecules small enough to reach cells infected by the virus.
In a report in the current issue of the journal Science, DuPont Merck's scientists said animal studies indicated that the company's designed drug had overcome the size problem.
But Dr. Jackson said the specific drugs described in Science still ran into unexpected problems when administered to humans last summer.
Dr. Jackson said the company has since developed another set of candidates using the same design technique that the company believes will fare better when tested in humans later this year.
At least two other drug companies, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Merck, also have recently developed experimental protease blockers using similar drug design technology.
Merck's drug is being tested in humans, and Wellcome PLC's Burroughs Wellcome Co. unit is expected to begin testing the Vertex drug soon.
