Tenneco Inc. said a unit would pay $250 million to redeem notes.
The unit, Tenneco Credit Corp., will redeem all of its 8 3/8% notes due Feb. 1, 1997.
The company said the notes will be redeemed Feb. 28 at 100% of principal plus interest accrued from Feb. 1, 1994 to Feb. 28, 1994.
Chase Manhattan Bank is the redemption agent.
A spokeswoman for Tenneco Inc., a manufacturing and gas-pipeline concern, said the redemption was part of an overall plan to reduce the company's debt.
