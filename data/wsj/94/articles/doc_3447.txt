International Business Machines Corp. plans to farm out management of the majority of its $29 billion employee pension fund in the hope of cutting costs and getting better returns.
Already, outside managers handle about $13 billion of the $29 billion fund.
Now, the computer maker plans to contract out the management of about $8 billion more, leaving an equal amount under internal management.
As part of the move, IBM will slash its 60-person fund-management staff by more than half, and its pension-fund manager, Carter F. Wolfe, is taking early retirement.
Mr. Wolfe, 54 years old, will become chief investment officer for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Md., the nation's largest private philanthropy with assets of about $8 billion and an annual budget of $333 million.
Mr. Wolfe says IBM will use more than one fund management company to take over the additional part of the pension fund, one of the nation's largest.
IBM is evaluating various fund managers but has not reached any decisions, he adds.
The funds that will continue to be managed internally are invested in stock indexes, says Mr. Wolfe, a 29-year IBM veteran.
Some of the more than 30 investment professionals and support staff who will lose their jobs will be laid off, while others may find jobs elsewhere in IBM, Mr. Wolfe says.
His successor in the post has not yet been named.
