State-owned Air France proposed a stock ownership plan to employees in an internal memo distributed yesterday.
Officials at unions representing Air France workers said the stock offer, part of a broader restructuring effort for the ailing carrier, would come in exchange for relinquishment of unspecified employee "advantages."
It wasn't clear whether management is asking for salary cuts.
Air France wouldn't comment on the memo's content.
Union officials said the memo also confirmed expectations that Chairman Christian Blanc would seek a big capital injection for the airline, though no numbers were given.
