AmVestors Financial Corp. expects to post fourth-quarter net income between $4.1 million and $4.5 million, or 49 cents to 53 cents a share, Ralph W. Laster Jr., chairman and chief executive, said.
A year earlier, the Topeka, Kan., insurance company, which sells single-premium deferred annuities, earned $756,000, or 12 cents a share.
(All per-share figures are fully diluted and are adjusted for a 1-for-2.5 reverse stock split last June.)
Net income in 1993 totaled $17.8 million to $18.1 million, or $2.43 to $2.47 a share, Mr. Laster said.
In 1992, net was $16.8 million, or $2.56 a share.
AmVestors' improved performance in 1993 is largely the result of an increase in the company's net interest margin to 1.8% in 1993 from 1.6% in 1992, Mr. Laster said.
The net interest margin is the difference between the interest rate AmVestors pays its policyholders -- currently about 5% -- and the yield the company earns on its portfolio.
The executive said he is comfortable with analysts' earnings projections of $1.25 to $1.35 a share for 1994 and $1.60 to $1.65 a share for 1995.
