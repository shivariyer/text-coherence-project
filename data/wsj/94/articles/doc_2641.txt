Heritage Media Corp.'s two biggest shareholders, Hallmark Cards Inc. and Tele-Communications Inc., filed plans to sell their combined 23% stake in a public offering that could total more than $300 million.
Heritage, a television, radio and marketing concern based in Dallas, disclosed last month that Hallmark, the Kansas City, Mo., greeting-card concern, was considering selling its 15.7% interest.
TCI, the Englewood, Colo., cable-TV giant, subsequently decided to offer its 7.6% stake as well.
The lead underwriter is CS First Boston Inc.
Assuming the exercise of an overallotment option granted to the underwriters, Hallmark and TCI will sell a total of 4.1 million common shares.
Heritage has about 17.5 million shares outstanding.
The sale by Hallmark and TCI will leave Heritage's chairman, James M. Hoak, as the company's biggest shareholder, a Heritage spokesman said.
Mr. Hoak and other managers own a roughly 10% stake.
