Tyson Foods Inc., Springdale, Ark., asked a Virginia federal court to invalidate takeover defenses erected by WLR Foods Inc., which Tyson has proposed to acquire for $30 a share, or $329 million.
The WLR defenses -- including a measure that could substantially dilute the holdings of any party that acquires 15% or more of the Hinton, Va., company's stock -- were put up after Tyson announced its unsolicited bid for the chicken and turkey processor in January.
Tyson, the nation's biggest poultry processor, is also asking the court to invalidate compensation packages that would be granted to WLR staff members in the event of a change in control of the company.
In addition, Tyson wants the court to declare unconstitutional a Virginia antitakeover statute.
A spokeswoman for WLR called Tyson's filing "totally without merit" and said the takeover defenses are in the best interests of WLR's shareholders.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, WLR closed at $28.50, up 62.5 cents, while Tyson closed at $21.50, up 25 cents.
Before Tyson's bid was announced Jan. 24, WLR's stock closed at $19 a share.
