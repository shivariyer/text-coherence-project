More than half the employees of Air France, the French state airline, would approve a salary cut as part of efforts to bring the airline back to profitability, an internal company survey shows.
The survey of 14,677 employees, in an internal publication, also shows they agree overwhelmingly with management that Air France's problems are "extremely serious" and that the staff is more concerned with internal questions than clients.
Still, on the salary cut question, 27% said it was an inappropriate measure and 12% said it was "an injustice."
Even those in favor said that it was an idea that had to be qualified to be implemented.
The airline was wracked by a crippling strike last October after ground crew became irate over efforts to cut mileage allowances and overtime as part of a larger layoff and cost-cutting plan.
The move coincided with an increase in pay for some flying staff, the result of agreements that were previously in place.
