Jim Baca, the controversial, hard-driving head of the Bureau of Land Management, resigned in a clash with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt over management style.
Mr. Babbitt said he had offered Mr. Baca the post of deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management, but Mr. Baca declined the assignment.
Mr. Babbitt insisted that Mr. Baca's views on boosting grazing fees paid by ranchers and on other issues don't differ from his policies, but said, "Jim and I have different approaches to management style and consensus building."
Mr. Baca has riled many ranchers, senators and governors by pushing environmentalist policies.
Mr. Baca, former New Mexico land commissioner, had strong support from environmental groups.
The groups contended that Mr. Baca was forced out because he pushed hard for the Interior Department's efforts to change grazing and mining policies.
Mr. Babbitt named Michael Dombeck acting bureau director.
Mr. Dombeck is currently chief of staff to Assistant Secretary Bob Armstrong and acting deputy assistant secretary.
