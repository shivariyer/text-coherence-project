Excel Technology Inc. said it signed a letter of intent to acquire United Technologies Corp.'s Industrial Lasers unit, which makes lasers used for welding and hardening applications in the automotive and aerospace industries.
Excel said the price will reflect certain specific assets and liabilities and a premium at the time of closing.
If the acquisition had taken place at the end of December, the price would have been about $7 million.
Hauppauge, N.Y.-based Excel, which makes laser systems, said it plans to complete the acquisition by March 31.
United Technologies is based in Hartford, Conn.
