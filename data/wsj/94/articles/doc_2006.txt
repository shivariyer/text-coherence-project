The European Union Commission cleared the acquisition of U.K. car maker Rover Group Holdings PLC from British Aerospace PLC by Germany's Bayerische Motoren Werke AG.
In a statement, the commission said the linkup would "only have a limited effect in terms of industry concentration."
BMW and Rover's combined share of the European passenger-car market will be equal to 6.6% based on 1993 registrations.
The acquisition mainly affects the large passenger-car market.
In some parts of the market, including the U.K. and Germany, BMW's share of the large-car segment will exceed 25%.
However, the commission said the takeover will increase BMW's market share only slightly, even in the U.K.
