MCI Communications Inc. said it will provide direct-dial long-distance phone service between the U.S. and Cuba in the next few months.
MCI said it entered an agreement with Empressa de Telecommunicationes de Cuba to provide phone service between the countries and is awaiting U.S. approval.
Direct telephone service between the U.S. and Cuba has been restricted for over thirty years, according to MCI.
Currently only 300 or so calls, placed through an operator, are permitted a day, the long distance carrier said.
About 1.5 million Cuban-Americans live in the U.S.
Following this agreement, MCI says it remains restricted from providing direct-dial service to only one country in the world: North Korea.
