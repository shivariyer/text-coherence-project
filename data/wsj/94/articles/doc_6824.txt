In the U.S., News Corp.'s movie business reported that operating profit more than doubled, aided by the film "Mrs. Doubtfire," which has grossed over $170 million so far and is just entering worldwide distribution.
The television business had record earnings, the company said, although results were affected by losses from the cancellation of "The Chevy Chase Show."
Operating profits from magazines and inserts fell 24% due to pricing pressures, while book publisher HarperCollins's world-wide operating profits rose 7% on a 6% revenue gain.
In the U.K., newspaper operating results fell 30% due to price cuts, although the company noted circulaton gains at the Sun and Times newspapers.
Australian newspapers' operating profit rose an unspecified amount while the Star TV operation had a small loss but has shown "encouraging growth," News Corp. said.
Separately, Patrick Purcell, publisher of News Corp.'s Boston Herald, is understood to be negotiating to buy the newspaper from News Corp. for an estimated $10 million.
News Corp. declined comment.
