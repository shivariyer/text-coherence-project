American Express Co. said it will reduce its European work force by 900 people over the next 18 months.
The cuts will affect back-office jobs at the company's largest unit, American Express Travel Related Services, a spokesman in London said.
The 900 jobs represent 9% of the unit's work force in Europe.
The spokesman said jobs will be eliminated throughout Europe, possibly heavily in Germany.
Britain will gain jobs, however, because as part of a consolidation of backoffice functions, the company plans to create 390 new jobs in Brighton, the spokesman said.
He said that some people from the continent will relocate there.
The purpose of the reductions is "to reduce operating costs and streamline operations," the spokesman said, adding that the action won't require any restructuring charge.
