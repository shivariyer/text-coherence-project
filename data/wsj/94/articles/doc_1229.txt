Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. said Daniel N. Copp was named executive vice president and chief financial officer, assuming the top financial post from Clyde T. Turner, who remains president and chief executive officer.
Mr. Copp, 49 years old, will oversee finance and investor relations, and will report to Mr. Turner.
Last month, William G. Bennett, Circus's co-founder and chairman, yielded the chief executive's title to Mr. Turner, and Kurt Sullivan was named executive vice president and chief operating officer.
The appointments are part of Circus's effort to stabilize senior management following a rash of executive departures and dismissals that rattled investors.
Some major institutional holders have privately expressed concern about management continuity at Circus, which has long been a favored pick among growth-oriented investors.
Circus' stock fell 75 cents to $36 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
Before forming a private financial-consulting firm, Mr. Copp spent 14 years at Federal Express Corp., where he served in various corporate communications and finance positions, including manager of investor relations and vice president of international finance.
Prior to that, he had worked as a securities analyst and portfolio manager.
Mr. Copp is the second senior executive to join Circus's ranks from the outside in the past year or so, which is a departure from the company's practice of grooming talent internally.
Mr. Turner, a longtime financial executive at Mirage Resorts Inc., joined Circus last year after the departure of Glenn Schaeffer as president and chief financial officer.
