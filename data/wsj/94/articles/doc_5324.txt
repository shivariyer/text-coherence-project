The three main corporate defendants in breast-implant litigation disclosed how they will divide up liability in a proposed $4 billion settlement, with Dow Corning Corp. agreeing to fund about half of the amount.
Dow Corning, the leading U.S. maker of silicone breast implants, said it agreed to pay about $2 billion over 30 years as its share of the settlement agreement.
Dow Corning is a Midland, Mich., joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc.
It was previously reported that Dow Corning, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Baxter International Inc., and several smaller players, reached agreement over the weekend on the details of funding the settlement agreement.
The settlement agreement isn't final yet.
Negotiators still are ironing out other details, with a deadline of March 8 for reaching a final deal.
Then the proposal would have to go before U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. in Birmingham, Ala., before it could go into effect.
Bristol-Myers would be the second-biggest payer into the litigation settlement fund.
A spokeswoman said it would kick in "up to $1.15 billion" toward the settlement over the 30 years of the deal.
Baxter said it will contribute approximately $556 million to the fund.
All three companies previously took charges related to the costs of implant litigation, and all said they expect varying portions of their liability to be paid by insurers.
Dow Corning and Bristol-Myers have dropped out of the breast-implant business; Baxter never was in it, but inherited liability through a merger.
All three companies deny silicone implants are related to any illnesses.
