Wilfried Prewo's Feb. 1 editorial-page article "Germany Is Not a Model" exposes the least-understood flaw in President Clinton's disastrous health plan: its built-in deficit.
Germans pay a 13.4% payroll tax to support a health care system that costs 10.6% of GDP.
Yet the Clinton administration claims that mandated premium payments below 8% of payroll can finance a system that spends 14% of GDP and is set to rise to 17% or 18%.
No calculator in the world can make the Clinton numbers add up.
Nor has the administration attempted it.
The Joint Economic Committee/GOP staff released a study, "A Billion Dollars a Day: The Financing Shortfall in President Clinton's Health Care Proposal," on Jan. 24, and it remains the only study that adds up the financing from all sources and compares the total with expenditure estimates.
Even when the administration's own cost estimates are used, the funds available to cover the outlays fall $918 billion short between 1995 and 2000.
This deficit is timed to explode soon after the plan's inauguration.
The JEC/GOP study also provides more realistic cost estimates and finds a 1995-2000 shortfall of $1.8 trillion, and a whopping $3.3 trillion if Fortune 500 coverage were extended to every American.
Business and individuals will have to pay 17% of payroll if the government tries to meet the middling estimate of the HSA gap ($1.8 trillion) by payroll "premiums" alone.
Under the Clinton bill, an economy-threatening concoction of higher taxes, huge deficits and rationing loom.
