Harvard International Technologies Ltd. said it signed a letter of intent with Sedona Industries Ltd. to acquire all Sedona common shares outstanding for two million Harvard common shares and 500,000 warrants.
The warrants will be priced at premium to market on the date the merger is completed and will be exercisable for a two-year period, Harvard International added.
The company said Sedona will also distribute its 25% stake, consisting of common shares and warrants, in Soranzo International Spirits Inc. to Sedona shareholders at the time of the merger.
Harvard International said the merger eliminates its obligation to pay royalties to Sedona in the future.
