You may have seen him on Cadillac commercials.
You may have caught his talk show on cable.
But you won't see Lawrence A. Kudlow speaking for investment banking firm Bear Stearns Cos. anymore.
Mr. Kudlow and Bear Stearns said they "have agreed that it is in Mr. Kudlow's best interest to resign from the firm," where he has been chief economist for eight years.
No successor was named.
The announcement said "Mr. Kudlow seeks to devote more time to his family and personal avocations and ultimately to pursue his long-standing interest in politics, journalism and economics."
But people familiar with the situation say Bear Stearns felt Mr. Kudlow tended to put his own interests ahead of those of the firm.
Bear Stearns declined to elaborate on its statement.
In an interview, Mr. Kudlow said he has been named economics editor of the National Review, William F. Buckley Jr.'s conservative journal following his "amicable departure" from his firm.
Mr. Kudlow, 46 years old, served in the Reagan White House's Office of Management and Budget.
