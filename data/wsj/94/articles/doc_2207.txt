Costain Group PLC said that it swung to a #68.7 million ($103.1 million) pretax profit in 1993 from a #204.6 million pretax loss the year before, helped by a strong performance by the overseas branch of its engineering and construction business.
The London-based building and engineering company said pretax profit before exceptional items was 200,000 pounds, a swing from a #16 million loss.
The main exceptional item was the sale of its Australian coal-mining business.
Costain said its engineering and construction unit achieved a "satisfactory profit margin of 1.8%, including interest receivable, in difficult market conditions."
The company said overseas sales in that unit constitute 29% of total sales, up from 16%.
