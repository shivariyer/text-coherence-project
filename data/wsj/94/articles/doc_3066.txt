Delta Air Lines has signed a cooperative agreement with Vietnam Airlines, industry officials said in Hong Kong and Hanoi, becoming the first U.S. airline to form such an alliance since Washington ended its economic embargo last month.
Under the agreement, reached last week and expected to be announced soon, Delta and Vietnam Airlines are to coordinate their flight schedules to feed each other passengers at an intermediate point in Asia, the officials said.
That arrangement will allow for cooperation in other areas, such as reservations, marketing and advertising.
The accord is expected to take effect this year as soon as details have been worked out.
Like other U.S. airlines, Delta can't fly to Vietnam because Washington and Hanoi lack an air-services agreement.
The airline will thus be limited to flying travelers from the U.S. to an Asian gateway, such as Taipei, Taiwan, or Seoul, South Korea, where they could make a quick connection to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City on Vietnam Airlines.
Currently, travelers from the U.S. often must endure long layovers, sometimes overnight, in other Asian countries before boarding a connecting flight to Vietnam.
Major U.S. carriers began courting Vietnam Airlines long before the embargo was lifted.
Just days after it ended, Stephen Wolf, chairman and chief executive officer of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, visited Hanoi for meetings with government authorities and airline officials.
In Washington, United, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines recently applied to the U.S. Transportation Department for licenses to fly to Vietnam.
But no U.S. airline will be allowed into Vietnam until a bilateral air-services agreement has been signed.
That is unlikely to happen before early 1995, U.S. airline officials say.
