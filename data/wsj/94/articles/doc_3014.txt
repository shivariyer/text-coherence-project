Standard & Poor's Corp. raised its senior debt rating for ITT Hartford Group Inc. to double-A from double-A-minus.
About $500 million in debt is affected.
The ratings concern said the upgrade stems from strong financial performance at the insurance concern, a unit of ITT Corp., New York.
ITT Hartford Group had a $682 million pretax profit for the first three quarters of 1993, compared with a loss of $576 million during the same period in 1992.
S&P added that ITT Hartford has a "strong diversified position" in the insurance industry.
The ratings agency also approved its triple-A claims-paying ability ratings on Hartford Fire Group, Hartford Life Insurance Co., Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. and ITT Hartford Life & Annuity Insurance Co.
The parent company, ITT, also has interests in financial services, hotels, defense and automotive products.
