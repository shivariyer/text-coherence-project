Leaders from UAL Corp. and its machinists union met in Washington, D.C., yesterday to try to resolve the points that snagged a proposed $5 billion employee buyout of the airline.
The company and the machinists put the negotiations in the hands of Stephen M. Wolf, UAL chairman, and John Peterpaul, chief negotiator for the International Association of Machinists.
Both sides had no comment on the talks.
On Tuesday, the parties, including the pilots union, failed to meet a deadline for signing a definitive agreement on the concession-for-equity transaction.
The machinists balked, claiming that United Airlines' management and noncontract employees weren't equitably shouldering their portion of the concessions.
The machinists want United's current employees to take bigger paycuts, and to rely less on paying new hires lower wages and benefits to help meet their obligation of providing costs savings.
The missed deadline frees United to pursue plans to contract out work and flight operations if it so chooses.
The unions negotiated the initial buyout agreement to prevent UAL management from proceeding with such steps.
