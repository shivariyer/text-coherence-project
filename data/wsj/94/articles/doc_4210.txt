Ford Motor Co. said a well-equipped Windstar GL minivan will have a base price of $19,455.
Windstar is Ford's first entry in the front-wheel-drive minivan segment, and has been hailed as the first serious competitor to Chrysler's minivans.
Chrysler's Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager are priced at $18,200 to $23,400.
The Windstar is derived from Ford's hot-selling Taurus sedan, with a ride and feel similar to a passenger car, analysts say.
Dual airbags, antilock brakes and air conditioning are among Windstar's standard features.
The top-of-the-line Windstar LX minivan will start at $23,540.
The vehicles will arrive in dealer showrooms this spring.
