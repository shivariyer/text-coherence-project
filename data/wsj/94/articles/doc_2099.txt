First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc. narrowed the range of cash and assets it expects to receive under a settlement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and said by late summer it expects to be looking for financial-services acquisitions in Texas.
In a disclosure filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, the former bank holding company said the initial distribution from the FDIC will be about $188 million, including $123.5 million in cash, down from the $200 million First City first disclosed.
Because the FDIC is selling assets faster than expected, the cash portion of the initial payment is bigger than announced.
But First City also lowered its valuation of the assets it is getting.
In January, the FDIC agreed to settle First City's lawsuit over the seizure of the company's 20 banks with the initial distribution followed by an additional amount dependent on proceeds from sale of assets.
First City estimates those additional distributions, which won't be reflected on the company's balance sheet coming out of bankruptcy court because of their contingent nature, in a range of $100 million to $140 million.
That narrows the estimate of the total FDIC settlement to between $288 million and $328 million.
The company had estimated the settlement at between $275 million and $375 million.
First City also revised the company's estimate of allowed creditor claims to a range of $65 million to $80 million, down from $80 million to $120 million.
As a result, First City estimates its opening equity coming out of bankruptcy-law proceedings in late summer should be approximately $140 million.
First City President Robert Brown said the company is "paying attention right now" to potential acquisition targets, but won't commit to anything until it emerges from bankruptcy-court protection.
