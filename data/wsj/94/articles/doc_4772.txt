Greenwich Pharmaceuticals Inc. posted a widened loss for the fourth quarter and hired an investment banking firm to find ways to "maximize the value of the company to its stockholders."
Greenwich, a drug maker, had a loss of $9.9 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.7 million, or 17 cents a share.
The company was forced to write down its inventory by $5.1 million in the quarter because of an unfavorable ruling on one of its drugs by the Food and Drug Administration.
The company also said it completed a restructuring that will result in a $1.7 million first-quarter charge.
The Fort Washington, Pa., company said it hired the New York investment banking firm D. Blech & Co. to seek ways to increase its shareholder value.
