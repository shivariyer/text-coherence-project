General Tire Inc. and Big O Tires Inc. said they "mutually agreed" to terminate a May 1993 marketing agreement between the two companies.
The agreement, to be renewed annually, had provided for General Tire, based in Akron, to supply tires to Big O, based in Englewood, Colo.
A spokeswoman for Big O said the agreement was terminated because of "policy differences between the two companies."
General Tire, the U.S. and Canadian arm of German tire maker Continental AG, will continue to sell tires to a division of Big O that supplies tires to distributors mainly in the Eastern U.S.
