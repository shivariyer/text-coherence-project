Placer Dome Canada Ltd. said it approved plans to expand two of its Ontario gold mines at a cost of about 160 million Canadian dollars (US$120.8 million).
Placer, a Vancouver, British Columbiabased gold-mining concern, said it will expand its open-pit mining operations at the Dome Mine in Timmins, Ontario, to increase annual gold production about 68% to 315,000 ounces from the current 187,000 ounces.
The C$150 million expansion is to cut cash production costs to about US$210 an ounce from US$227 in 1993.
Construction is expected to begin in April.
Placer also plans to install an underground conveyor and crushing system at the Detour Lake Mine, 185 miles north of Timmins, for C$10 million.
The system will allow further access to ore and extend the mine's life to the year 2000, and possibly beyond.
Average cash production costs will be cut to $240 an ounce from $250 in 1993 on completion of the nine-month project.
