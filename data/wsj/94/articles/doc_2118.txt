Slamming the door shut on the art-market recession, both Sotheby's Holdings Inc. and Christie's International PLC reported that 1993 was their most profitable year since 1990.
At both New York auction house Sotheby's and its London-based rival Christie's, 1993 earnings were more than double year-earlier levels.
It appears that the art market is recovering from its collapse in 1990 and that the costly expansion and restructuring that both firms undertook during the downturn are largely over.
Sotheby's, which celebrated its 250th anniversary last week, said fourth-quarter net income soared 78%.
Sotheby's share price rose 37.5 cents to $18.75 on the news in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, its highest level since June 1990.
(Christie's doesn't release quarterly profits.)
Auction-house officials aren't predicting a return to the stratospheric prices of the late 1980s.
But there has been "a good, solid improvement in the market," said Diana D. Brooks of Sotheby's.
Mrs. Brooks, currently Sotheby's world-wide head of auction operations, will take over as its president April 1, upon the departure of Michael Ainslie.
But despite the sharp increase in profit, the auction industry's problems aren't all necessarily in the past.
Sales remain soft in Europe.
Substantially more good-quality property is hitting the auction block, but estate attorneys are increasingly requesting cash advances or price guarantees, a risky practice for the auction houses.
However, both firms report that painting and furniture sales increased markedly in 1993, and jewelry sales were particularly strong.
At Christie's, for example, jewelry sales rose 29% in 1993.
Sotheby's said that fourth-quarter net income rose to $20.6 million, or 36 cents a share, from $11.6 million, or 21 cents a share, in 1992.
Revenue for the quarter rose 23% to $103.7 million from $84.5 million.
Sotheby's said it took a $2.4 million nonrecurring charge against pretax earnings related to severance payments and further reorganization of its European and Asian operations.
Sotheby's net for the year rose to $19.3 million, or 35 cents a share, from $4 million, or seven cents a share in 1992, when Sotheby's took a $4.9 million restructuring charge for staff cutbacks and other costs related to its European reorganization.
Auction sales for the year rose $194 million to $1.3 billion.
Christie's reported 1993 pretax profit rose to $28.5 million, or 10 cents a share, up from $11.1 million, or 3.7 cents a share in 1992.
The results included a one-time gain of $4 million from the sale of residential real estate.
Total 1993 auction sales climbed to $1.1 billion from $1.06 billion a year earlier.
Christie's doesn't release earnings after taxes.
