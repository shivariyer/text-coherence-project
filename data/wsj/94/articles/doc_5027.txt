Mergers and acquisitions in information technology surged 35% to 713 transactions in 1993, the highest level since 1988, a survey found.
Broadview Associates, based in Fort Lee, N.J., said the transactions were valued at about $28 billion, up 33% from the previous year.
The software and information services sector led the pack with a 47% increase in the number of transactions from 1992, followed by a 28% increase in hardware, and a 13% in telecommunication services.
"M&A continues to play a key role in the growth strategies of many of the industry's leading companies," Broadview said in its report.
Broadview said the overall makeup of the information technology industry continues to be dominated by relatively small private companies, who are developing new technologies and markets "with a speed that is often beyond the reach of many larger, public companies."
It said only 5% of the transactions involved the sale of public companies.
