Australia's government-owned telecommunications concern, Telstra Corp., is considering scaling back its commitment to provide local telephone service in Hong Kong.
According to a Telstra official, the company is reviewing its current agreement with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. that calls for Telstra to take a 20% stake in a new telephone network serving business communities on Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon peninsula.
The network is expected to cost HK$3.5 billion (US$450 million).
Telstra and Hutchison are now "refining" their accord, the Telstra official said, adding that "it's too early to say what the outcome will be."
Hutchison declined to comment.
Industry executives familiar with the negotiations say Telstra may drop its equity participation, opting instead to be a strategic partner providing the expertise and technology-but not the cash.
The Telstra-Hutchison partnership was one of three groups chosen last year by the Hong Kong government to provide local fixed-line telephone services after Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd.'s exclusive franchise expires in July 1995.
