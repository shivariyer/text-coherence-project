Redwood Empire Bancorp said it expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of $1 million to $1.1 million, or 34 cents to 36 cents a share, up more than 40% from the year earlier.
The Santa Rosa, Calif., company, part savings-and-loan association and part commercial bank, cited a flood of new home-loan business.
The estimated results compare with net income of $709,000, or 28 cents a share, in 1992's fourth quarter.
For all of 1993, Redwood expects to report earnings of $4.5 million to $4.6 million, or $1.53 to $1.54 a share, up 73% from $2.6 million, or $1.11 a share, in 1992, said John H. Downey Jr., chairman.
The estimates are within the range expected by analysts.
Redwood said it plans to announce results Feb. 14.
The S&L business generates 75% of its earnings mainly through originations of home mortgages.
Last year, it wrote $1.9 billion in such loans, a 127% increase from 1992.
