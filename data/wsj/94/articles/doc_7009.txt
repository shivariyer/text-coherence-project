Allstate Corp. said it expects to pay $350 million in claims on the Los Angeles earthquake, suggesting the insurance industry might end up paying more in claims than the $2 billion currently estimated.
Most of Allstate's losses stem from homeowners insurance.
The company has about 15.6% of the California market for homeowners coverage, suggesting industrywide homeowner claims of about $2.2 billion.
But that would only be part of the total cost.
The industry must also pay claims for damage to commercial properties and for income lost by policyholders with business-interruption coverage.
Allstate, the second-largest homeowner-insurance company after State Farm Mutual Life Insurance Co., is the first major homeowners insurer to report its claims cost on the earthquake.
By comparison, Allstate paid $2.7 billion in claims on Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
Although the Sears, Roebuck & Co. unit didn't say how much its net financial loss will be on the earthquake, the loss figure isn't expected to differ widely from the claims amount because Allstate has little reinsurance for its homeowners coverage.
Reinsurance allows insurance companies to transfer risk among each other.
"Virtually no reinsurance applies here," said an Allstate spokeswoman.
The company said it received more than 25,000 claims, including both auto and property.
Separately, Travelers Inc. said it doesn't expect its net costs on the earthquake -- after taxes and reinsurance -- will be more than $15 million.
Travelers received fewer than 150 claims.
