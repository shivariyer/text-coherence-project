In a Dec. 27 marketplace report about the Dec. 16 "Prime Time Live" account of a possible conspiracy involved in the murder of Martin Luther King, you said that the story had been rejected by other organizations because it was too difficult to prove and that it "renewed concerns within the industry about whether unproven stories are being aired" because of competition among TV newsmagazines.
This story appeared, of course, in the same edition in which the Journal reported the unproven stories about North Korea's possession of a nuclear bomb (the Defense Department says it isn't so) and a child's accusation of sexual molestation by Michael Jackson (Mr. Jackson says it isn't so).
I would hesitate to say that you repeated those reports because of increased competition for declining readership.
But I would like to make a point about the "industry" concern.
There has been talk about a conspiracy to murder Mr. King for some time.
A lot of organizations, including those you quote, tried to find people who would talk about it.
Most failed.
We succeeded.
Our reporting was careful to point out the problems in the statements of those involved -- but those involved were giving a firsthand account of their own acts.
They did so at some risk to themselves financially and legally.
Proof of the statements probably will have to come through the courts -- as in the Michael Jackson case.
But a firsthand account by a person willing to go on the record and give plausible details of a major crime is a news story.
That it wasn't leaked anonymously in Washington from an official source who talked to all the papers doesn't make it less so.
Maybe we reported it because even those with agendas, like the CIA, may be telling the truth and it's worth looking into.
