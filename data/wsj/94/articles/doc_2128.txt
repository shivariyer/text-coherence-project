Merrill Lynch & Co.'s run of bullish earnings buoyed the 1993 pay packages of its top four executives to more than $6 million apiece, signaling another record year for Wall Street pay.
In a proxy statement, Merrill said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Tully received a 1993 pay package valued at about $9.9 million.
Merrill, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, posted record profit last year.
Mr. Tully received 1993 cash pay of $6.7 million, up 29% from 1992.
He also received restricted stock and options on Merrill shares that the company currently values at about $3 million, but that don't fully vest for four years.
Three other senior executives received pay packages currently valued at more than $6 million, an average increase of 23% from 1992 pay levels.
The pay packages "may be large, but Merrill has aligned its interests and pay with how shareholders are being rewarded or suffering," says Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
With the fourfold run-up in Merrill's stock since early 1991, "shareholders really aren't going to complain," he says.
Meanwhile, Merrill is taking steps to formally tie its executives' pay to performance goals -- net income and return on equity -- in a bid to protect its corporate tax deductions for executive pay over $1 million.
As reported, Wall Street firms are scrambling to protect their corporate tax deductions in the wake of a new tax law that bars any publicly held corporation from deducting salaries of more than $1 million apiece for its top executives unless the pay is based on performance goals approved by shareholders.
Nobody at Merrill received higher pay than Mr. Tully in 1993.
But a handful of traders and investment bankers received 1993 pay packages of more than $6 million, people familiar with Merrill say.
"We don't comment on the compensation of other employees other than those we have to publicly disclose," a spokesman said.
Merrill's fat paychecks indicate that 1993 will be the third-consecutive record year for Wall Street's already-lofty pay levels.
The nation's securities firms had pretax profit of $8.95 billion last year, 45% above the prior record in 1992.
More than a handful of Wall Street executives and traders earned $10 million and up.
Merrill's executive pay is among the highest on Wall Street, as is its profit.
In 1993, Merrill had record pretax earnings of $2.4 billion; net income of $1.39 billion, before the effect of changes in accounting principles, was the highest ever by a U.S. publicly traded brokerage firm, and 47% above 1992 levels.
Merrill's 1993 return on equity was 27.8%.
Over the past five years, Merrill's stock has far outpaced the Standard & Poor's-500 index, as well as a group of 10 securities-industry rivals.
Yesterday, Merrill's stock fell 25 cents, to $43 a share, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
For the past several years, the only publicly traded Wall Street firm paying top executives more than Merrill is Bear Stearns Cos.
For Bear's 1993 fiscal year ended June 30, the chairman and the chief executive each got cash pay of $15.9 million.
Bear says the bulk of its executive pay is tied to the firm's performance.
Merrill defends its compensation.
"These are competitive pay levels of this industry for people in these positions," a spokesman says.
"This is what it takes to retain the best possible top executives."
The 1993 pay of Mr. Tully, who became Merrill chairman in June, includes restricted Merrill stock valued at $1.45 million when it was approved on Jan. 17, 1994.
The value of this restricted stock rose to $1.47 million on Jan. 26, the day it was granted.
Mr. Tully also received options on 133,920 Merrill shares, which can be exercised over four years at a price of $40.625 a share.
Merrill valued the stock options at $1.45 million when they were approved, but the value rose to $1.58 million by the day they were granted.
Mr. Tully also received $161,342 in "other" compensation in 1993, the proxy says.
As of Dec. 31, Mr. Tully also held more than $40 million in unexercised options on Merrill shares, $26.4 million of which were exercisable.
In addition to Mr. Tully, several other Merrill senior executives received princely paychecks.
Merrill executive vice presidents John L. Steffens, David H. Komansky and Herbert M. Allison Jr. each received 1993 cash pay of $4.45 million -- up 27%, 29% and 35%, respectively, from a year earlier.
With restricted shares and Merrill options, the total 1993 pay packages of Messrs. Steffens, Komansky and Allison were valued at Jan. 26 at about $6.2 million, $6.1 million and $6.1 million, respectively.
Stephen L. Hammerman, vice chairman and Merrill's general counsel, received a 1993 pay package valued at about $4.9 million in cash, restricted stock and options on Merrill shares.
That's up from about $4.0 million in 1992.
Merrill says the base salaries for its senior executives range from 7% to 9% of their total compensation.
The balance of their pay packages -- cash bonus and long-term equity-incentive compensation -- is tied directly to Merrill's earnings performance and return on equity.
