Japan's Sumitomo Cement Co. and Osaka Cement Co. will merge on Oct. 1 to form the second-largest cement company in Japan, company officials announced Thursday.
The merger will value one share of Osaka Cement at 0.75 share of Sumitomo Cement, they said.
The announcement follows reports about the merger plans earlier in Thursday's trading session that led the Tokyo Stock Exchange to suspend trading in both issues.
Company officials said pretax profit for the merged company, to be called Sumitomo Osaka Cement K.K., is seen at 5.2 billion yen ($49.1 million) during the fiscal year that ends March 31, 1996, off 2.3% from the combined 5.32 billion yen seen for the current fiscal year.
Sales are also expected to decline over the next two years, with the merger's sales seen at 203 billion yen in the year ending March 1996.
That forecast would mark a 3.9% drop from the combined 211.13 billion yen seen for the companies this fiscal year.
