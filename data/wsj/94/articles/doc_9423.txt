You got your laugh at Andnzei Szulc, the Polish translator, and at the Polish language itself.
What a quaint, unsophisticated little language it is -- and so bizarre when translated literally into English (page one, Dec. 1).
Yes, you did mention that the translations sound perfectly fine in Polish, perhaps even better than the original, and you did imply that the language might be quite beautiful to those whose ears and tongues are accustomed to it.
Perhaps Mr. Szulc, rather than struggling to turn what no doubt to him is a strange and guttural language into flowing and correct Polish, should translate the novels in a rigid, literal manner, just as you have done with the poor translations of Polish, and give the Poles a hearty laugh.
They would exclaim, no doubt, that English must indeed be a decidedly ridiculous and grotesque language.

Your article about Andnzei Szulc struck a discordant note with me.
Reverse word order is not peculiar to the Polish language.
Therein lies the difficulty in a translation that must become a transliteration in order to be understood.
One must also face idiomatic expression in both languages being translated.
In my work translating correspondence to and from Poland, I am constantly faced with these situations.
