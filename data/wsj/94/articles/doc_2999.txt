Kimberly-Clark Corp. unveiled a new line of absorbent underpants for children of ages five through 11.
The Dallas company, a maker of household, personal-care and health-care products, said the new line, called Pull-Ups Goodnites, is aimed at the market of more than three million U.S. children who experience bed-wetting.
"Goodnites absorbent underpants respond to this previously unmet need and eliminate the necessity of washing sheets and pajamas after nighttime accidents," said Thomas J. Falk, group president of Kimberly-Clark's infant and child-care group.
The pants will be available in two unisex sizes, fitting children weighing between 45 and 85 pounds.
Shipments will begin nationally in April.
Separately, the company said it will begin national shipments in March of a revised Pull-Ups training-pants line, which will have new leakage control shields.
