MathSoft Inc. will post a wider-than-expected loss on a 14% increase in sales for its second quarter ended Dec. 30, according to President David A. Blohm.
Mr. Blohm also gave details about major product and pricing changes and said that the Cambridge, Mass., software maker is "examining costs in every area of the business" to restore profitability.
MathSoft will report a loss of about $1.7 million, or 24 cents to 26 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $317,000, or five cents a share, on fewer shares.
Analysts had expected a second-quarter loss of 16 cents to 17 cents a share.
Revenue climbed to about $6.4 million, from $5.6 million in the year-earlier period, Mr. Blohm said.
The rise may disappoint investors who've been accustomed to sharply higher growth rates recently.
MathSoft's core product is Mathcad, a powerful software program for engineers, scientists and students.
