Recording and filmed entertainment group PolyGram NV said it acquired Dutch movie maker Movies Film Productions, exercising an option it acquired in May 1993.
London-based PolyGram, 75%-owned by Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands, said MFP is the "leading independent film producer and distributor" in the Benelux countries.
MFP has been distributing PolyGram films in the Benelux region since mid-1993.
