Homestake Mining Co. and Prime Resources Group Inc. said they decided not to build a smelter in connection with their development of the Eskay Creek gold mine in northwestern British Columbia, Canada.
Homestake, which holds 54% of Eskay Creek owner Prime of British Columbia, said it plans to sell ore from the mine to existing smelters, saving the project about $150 million in capital costs.
Under the development plan, capital costs to complete the project are about $60 million, Homestake said.
Homestake said it chose not to build its own smelter and refining plant at the site to reduce the project's risk to shareholders.
The metallurgically complex ore at the mine would have required the company to build an autoclave, or pressure oxidation unit.
While that was considered economically viable, it is a more difficult and complex alternative to a traditional smelter.
The plan also projects an annual mining rate of 210,000 ounces of gold and 9.4 million ounces of silver from an underground mine.
Cash costs are expected to be about $81 an ounce.
If smelting costs were added to reach a figure comparable to other mining companies' cash costs of gold mining, the cash costs would be about $187, Homestake said.
Eskay Creek's current reserves are about 2.3 million ounces of gold and 102 million ounces of silver.
The mine life is expected to be about 10 years, based on current reserves.
Commercial production is expected to begin early in 1995 and Homestake will be the operator.
