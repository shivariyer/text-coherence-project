Genentech Inc. said it filed a patent-infringement lawsuit in Houston federal court against Tanox Biosystems Inc. related to research and development of antibodies to interrupt allergic reactions.
The suit follows the filing of a similar action by Houston-based Tanox in Texas state court in Houston last December.
Tanox alleges in court documents that Genentech "appropriated" its antibody invention, which it revealed to Genentech in 1989 in hopes of collaborating under a confidentiality agreement.
The companies did not come to terms, and Tanox chose another partner.
Tanox alleges Genentech breached their confidentiality agreement.
In its lawsuit, Genentech, based in South San Francisco, Calif., alleges that Tanox's product infringes on processes it patented.
The company also asserts that it did not violate their confidentiality pact and that it derived its antibody technology independently of its talks with Tanox.
