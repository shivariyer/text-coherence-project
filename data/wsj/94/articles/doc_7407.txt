Siemens Nixdorf Informations-systeme AG, the computer unit of Siemens AG, said it will offer its German workers voluntary work-time reduction in exchange for job security.
The company is asking workers to cut their hours 10% to 15%.
A spokeswoman said that if enough employees subscribe to the program, job cuts for the unit that have already been announced could be reduced.
Siemens had said it expects to cut about 5,000 positions this year at the SNI unit.
SNI employs about 31,000 people in Germany.
Workers are being asked to agree to reduced hours for as long as four years.
