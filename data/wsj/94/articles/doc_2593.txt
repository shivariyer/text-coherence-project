William I. Koch, the winning skipper of the 1992 America's Cup, said he plans to launch the first all-women's team to compete for the sailing trophy in 1995.
Mr. Koch, who is chairman and chief executive of America-3, the foundation that is sponsoring the team, said his group would provide the same organization, technology and equipment to the women's team that it provided to the winning team in 1992.
America-3 expects to operate on a budget of about $20 million, most of which will come from outside donations.
Officials of America-3 said they are negotiating with sponsors from the fashion industry, including designer Ralph Lauren, who was a sponsor in 1992.
Mr. Koch said nine of 22 team members have been chosen, including several U.S. Olympic medalists.
Tryouts for remaining spots begin next month.
The new yachting team will compete in the world championships in San Diego this fall and against the two other candidates seeking to defend the U.S. title in trials scheduled for January 1995 through April 1995.
The winner will represent the U.S. in the America's Cup competition in May 1995.
