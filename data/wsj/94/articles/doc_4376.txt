Duracraft Corp. expects to report that net income for the fourth quarter nearly tripled to about $1.5 million, or 30 cents a share, from $572,000, or 15 cents, said Bernard Chiu, chairman and president.
The Whitinsville, Mass., maker of heaters, humidifiers and fans expects to report Monday that sales rose more than 40% to about $20 million from $14 million.
Duracraft went public in November, selling 1.84 million shares.
Average shares for the latest quarter were five million compared to 3.75 million the year before.
Mr. Chiu said the improved results reflect strong sales, improved manufacturing efficiency and introduction of some higher-margin products.
For 1993, Duracraft is expected to report that net more than doubled to about $5 million, or $1.25 a share, from $2.3 million, or 62 cents a share; revenue rose about 34% to around $75 million from $56 million.
