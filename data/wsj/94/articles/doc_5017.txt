Dean Foods Co. said it has terminated talks with Dairymen Inc. of Louisville, Ky., regarding the acquisition of its Flav-O-Rich fluid milk and ice cream operations.
Dean, which has operations in dairy and other food lines, wouldn't say why the negotiations ended, but said the action was "our decision."
Last June, Dean disclosed its interest in Flav-O-Rich hoping to boost its presence in the growing Southeastern market.
Flav-O-Rich operates nine milk plants and two ice cream plants in the Southeast and had 1992 sales of $400 million.
