Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. will keep its corporate headquarters in Louisville, Richard Scott, president and chief executive officer, told employees.
Louisville had been competing with Nashville, Tenn., which was the headquarters of HCA Hospital Corp. of America.
Columbia acquired HCA last month.
Mr. Scott said Columbia will add 300 employees to its 850-member headquarters staff.
The company also said it will build a 150,000-square-foot headquarters building.
