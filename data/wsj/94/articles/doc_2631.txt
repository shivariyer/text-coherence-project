LDI Corp. said it hired Bear, Stearns & Co. to help senior management conduct "a comprehensive strategic business review."
The Cleveland company said its objective is to identify and recommend appropriate action for "noncore" businesses, to evaluate the benefits of facilities consolidation, and to develop other ways to enhance profitability.
The company, which leases and sells new and used data-processing, telecommunications and other high-technology equipment as well as providing other services, also said it's getting out of the personal-computer superstore business.
The company said it plans to close its three superstores and sell their inventory.
