Pacific Telesis Group said its board gave final approval for the spinoff of the company's wireless businesses, known as Pactel Corp.
The date for the spinoff was set for April 1.
Pactel, which includes the regional phone company's cellular, paging and vehicle location operations, went public in December.
Pacific Telesis now owns 424 million shares of PacTel Corp. stock, about 86% of the shares outstanding.
These shares will be distributed to Pacific Telesis shareholders of record as of March 21 in a 1-for-1, tax-free transaction.
The distribution of the shares is expected to be completed April 5.
After the spinoff, Pacific Telesis will have no financial interest in PacTel Corp., which will change its name to AirTouch Communications.
PacTel revenue was $988 million in 1993.
