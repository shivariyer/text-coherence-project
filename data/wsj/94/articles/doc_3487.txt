Biotechnology company Centocor Inc. said its chairman, Hubert J.P. Schoemaker, is expected to return to work this month.
Mr. Schoemaker, the company's chief technology strategist, last week underwent a successful surgery to remove a malignant brain tumor.
A company spokesman said the tumor was of a slow-growing type and sensitive to chemotherapy.
He added that while the post-operative treatment hasn't yet been determined, it "may well include chemotherapy."
Mr. Schoemaker turned over day-to-day command of Centocor in November 1992 to David P. Holveck, who became chief executive officer and president.
The move came after the company's failure that year to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for its intended core product, Centoxin, as a treatment of septic shock.
