The mortgage-insurance premium charged to FHA-assisted homebuyers will be cut to 2.25% from 3% next month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said.
Currently, the Federal Housing Administration charges homebuyers an up-front mortgage insurance premium of 3% of the mortgage amount.
HUD cited the FHA's desire to increase the affordability of FHA financing for first-time and lower-income homebuyers as the chief reason for the cut, which will occur April 17.
HUD also announced changes in its so-called 203 (K) home-rehabilitation loan program to make it "more user friendly for both lenders and consumers," and said the secondary market for these loans will be expanded to include the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
Separately, HUD named four trustee banks -- Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust, First Chicago, and First Trust -- and two accounting firms -- Deloitte & Touche and Arthur Andersen -- to work with the Government National Mortgage Association in the initial phase of its Remic program.
Remics, or real-estate mortgage investment conduits, provide a method of dividing up the income flows from many mortgages into new securities with various interest rates and maturities.
GNMA is a corporation within HUD that guarantees privately owned securities backed by pools of federally insured or guaranteed mortgages.
