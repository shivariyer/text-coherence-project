Italian cabinet ministers decided to award the country's second and hotly contested cellular telephone license to Omnitel, a consortium led by Ing.
C. Olivetti & Co. and Pronto Italia, a group that includes Pacific Telesis Group of the U.S.
The losing group was Unitel, which includes Fiat SpA, Fininvest Spa and state energy giant ENI SpA.
Omnitel declined to comment.
Fiat officials weren't available to comment.
Precise estimates for the value of the award weren't immediately available but Italian domestic telephone operator Societa per l'Esercizio della Telecomunicazioni, which owns of the first cellular license awarded in Italy, already has about 1.3 million subscribers, according to its recently released 1993 results.
