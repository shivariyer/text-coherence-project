Conner Peripherals Inc., after three consecutive quarterly losses amid a computer disk-drive price war, earned a modest $8.5 million in the fourth quarter.
The results, equal to 17 cents a share, were identical to those reported a year earlier.
Sales slumped 7.4% to $574.4 million, from $620.5 million.
For 1993, the San Jose, Calif., disk-drive maker had a loss of $445.3 million, or $9.03 a share, compared with net income of $121.1 million, or $2.19 a share, in 1992.
The 1993 loss reflects restructuring charges and write-downs, among other items, of $338.4 million, much of it taken in the third quarter.
The consensus of analysts was for Conner to post a loss of 38 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
But Todd Bakar, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said there has been "a lot of whispering in the last few days that they were going to make money."
