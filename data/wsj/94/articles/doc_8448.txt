The U.S. and Canada have reached an impasse in their negotiations for an agreement governing salmon fishing off the Pacific coast, Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said.
He said that in view of the deadlock Canada has decided against participating in the next round of negotiations scheduled to be held in Portland, Ore., starting next Monday.
The agreement is considered necessary to conserve limited stocks of salmon that migrate between the waters of the two countries.
Canadian officials said the U.S. negotiators were obstructing Canadian efforts to work out equity arrangements for the salmon catch.
Such arrangements would assure that each country receives the full fisheries benefit from its own salmon production.
Settlement of the equity issue is important to Canada because much more Canadian salmon is being intercepted by U.S. fishermen than U.S. salmon by Canadian fishermen.
Under proposed equity rules, interception advantages enjoyed by either country are supposed to be offset by compensation and adjustments in fishing patterns.
But this can't be done until a compensation system is agreed through equity negotiations, which were supposed to parallel negotiations on salmon catch limits.
The Canadian officials said that after five negotiating sessions the U.S. side has stated that it has no proposals to advance the equity negotiations, "effectively blocking" them.
