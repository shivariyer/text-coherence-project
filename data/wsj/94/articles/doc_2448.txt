Shareholders of United Water Resources Inc. and GWC Corp. of Wilmington, Del., approved UWR's $200 million acquisition of the water utility.
The transaction still requires approval by state utility regulatory commissions and is expected to close in April.
Under the terms of the agreement, GWC's principal unit, General Waterworks Corp., will become a wholly owned subsidiary of United Water.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez SA, a French water purveyor that currently owns 82% of GWC's shares, will own about 26% of United Water common shares upon completion of the deal.
