The New York state Insurance Department has begun to look into whether insurance agents with Prudential Insurance Co. of America sold limited partnerships in the state without the proper license.
New York is the second state to explore whether insurance agents, in addition to stockbrokers, sold the partnerships that have gotten Prudential's brokerage firm, Prudential Securities, into trouble.
New York said it is gathering information for what could lead to an investigation.
In 1991, Oregon alleged that some Prudential insurance agents sold the partnerships without the proper license.
Prudential eventually settled the charges.
The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and the Securities and Exchange Commission, are currently investigating whether the practice was widespread.
Prudential said it knows of no New York agents who improperly sold the partnerships.
The company said it routinely receives inquiries from state insurance departments.
