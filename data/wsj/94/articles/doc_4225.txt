Canon Inc., Tokyo, said its profit for the year ending Dec. 31 will be hurt if the yen-dollar exchange rate stays below 105 yen to the dollar for an extended period.
Earlier this week, Canon said it expects to post a 23 billion yen ($217.9 million) consolidated net profit on sales of 1.9 trillion yen ($18.03 billion) for the year ending Dec. 31.
But Chairman Ryuzaburo Kaku told Dow Jones Asian Equities Report that meeting the forecast will depend on currency fluctuations.
The yen strengthened to just above 102 yen to the dollar in mid-February after the collapse of U.S.-Japan trade talks.
It has since retreated somewhat, closing at 105.40 on Thursday in Tokyo.
In the year ended last Dec. 31, Canon saw its sales fall 4.1% to 1.836 trillion yen from 1.914 trillion yen the year before.
Its pretax profit slid 41% to 60.03 billion yen from 101.63 billion yen, while net profit fell to 21.1 billion yen from 35.62 billion yen, a 41% drop.
The company blamed sluggish economies in Japan and Europe and the high yen, which makes Canon's products more expensive overseas and reduces the yen-denominated value of international sales.
