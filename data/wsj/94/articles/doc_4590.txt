Stock and bond prices climbed amid investor relief that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan delivered no unpleasant surprises in testimony before Congress.
The dollar also rose.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 24.20 points to 3911.66.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.77 to 471.46, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.30 to 791.15.
The financial markets reacted favorably to Mr. Greenspan's semiannual appearance on Capitol Hill.
In his remarks, he said short-term interest rates are likely to climb, but he stopped short of predicting when the next Fed rate increase would occur.
"Chairman Greenspan didn't say anything radical in his testimony," said Stefan D. Abrams, director of equity strategy at Trust Co. of the West in Los Angeles.
"If the markets were interpreting everything in a bearish way on Friday, they returned to an even keel today."
Stocks were aided by some upbeat earnings news.
A better-than-expected profit report from Deere sparked buying in a broad range of economically sensitive stocks.
Consumer stocks also surged.
"Although short rates will trend higher in the months ahead, this will be amply offset by excellent corporate profit growth reflecting the buoyant economy," Mr. Abrams said.
Besides Mr. Greenspan's remarks, bond traders also heard President Clinton give a favorable assessment on the economy and interest rates.
After Mr. Greenspan's testimony, Mr. Clinton said he believes economic growth can continue with little inflation and relatively low interest rates.
The bond market recovered a bit from its sharp selloff last week.
Eric K. Cheung, manager of the fixed-income division of Wilmington Trust Co. said the declines last week indicated bond traders are preparing for the next Fed rate increase.
Mr. Cheung expects the federal-funds rate -- the rate banks charge one another for short-term loans -- to be raised another 1/4 point early in the second quarter.
"The bond market has room for it and is already pricing it in," Mr. Cheung said.
World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.74 to 115.57.
Stock prices rose.
Volume totaled 270,636,000 shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,139 issues rose and 1,003 fell.
Bond prices climbed.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue gained 5/16 point, or more than $3.125 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.60%.
The dollar strengthened.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.7235 marks and 105.65 yen, compared with 1.7140 marks and 104.60 yen Friday.
