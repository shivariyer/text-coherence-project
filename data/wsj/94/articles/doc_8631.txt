British Aerospace PLC said it will cut 510 jobs from its weapons-making unit.
Defense-spending cutbacks by the British and the U.S. governments made the job cuts necessary.
The company said various orders have been shrunk or canceled recently.
"The market for the products has continued to be challenging," a spokeswoman said.
She added that the decision to trim staff wasn't based on the loss of a particular contract but rather the diminished demand for the missiles and other weapons British Aerospace makes.
British Aerospace's Lostock plant in England will bear the brunt of the cutbacks, as 330 of the 510 jobs to be cut are in that plant.
