The lucky Houstonian who won last week's $41 million Lotto Texas drawing doesn't have anything on the people at RS Communications.
They've started their own lottery.
The Dallas concern, which bills itself as a "telecommunications" company, has set up what it hopes will be a nationwide telephone survey to gauge interest in a national lottery to reduce the federal deficit.
The survey, advertised in community newspapers and free-classified-ad publications, has been running for the past week, and asks callers to dial one number if they support a national lottery, another if they oppose it, and a third if they're undecided.
The catch: The calls are all on a "900" line and will cost you $3.95 a pop.
Sylvia Williams, the "S" in RS Communications, notes that the company will dutifully forward 7% of its take, or about 28 cents per call, as a contribution to the federal government to help reduce the deficit.
"People are tired of having their taxes raised," she says.
Another 75 cents will go to the long-distance company, and 40 cents will be paid to the people who own the 900 lines.
The balance -- $2.52 per call -- goes into the pockets of Ms. Williams and her partner, Robbin Brown.
Ms. Williams and Ms. Brown, who also work part-time jobs marketing long-distance services, say they came up with the idea in a "brainstorming" session after acquiring the 900 lines.
Ms. Williams, for one, isn't shy about her intentions for the project.
"We're definitely looking to make some money on it," she says.
"That's why we're in business."
Ms. Brown, for her part, says the pair already is considering extending the lottery survey indefinitely, in hopes of snagging more callers.
(They won't say how many they have snared already.)
And, she says, the entrepreneurs already have their eye on their next, big telephone survey.
"We're taking a look at health care," she says.
