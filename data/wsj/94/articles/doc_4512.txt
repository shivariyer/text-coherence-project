Louis V. Gerstner Jr. is at it again.
The chairman and chief executive of International Business Machines Corp. has bought another parcel of IBM stock, snapping up 5,000 shares on Jan. 28 at $58.125.
Problem is, the stock of the computer company has dropped back to levels around $53 a share since his latest purchase.
Yesterday, an endorsement by Canon Inc. of IBM's Power PC chip for use in personal computers helped lift IBM's shares by 75 cents to $53.375 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Gerstner's latest vote of confidence in the stock follows six other separate buys by the chairman since he joined IBM in April 1993, bringing his total open market purchases to 30,000 shares for some $1.43 million, recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings show.
These purchases come despite analysts' persistent concerns about flagging revenue from the company's core mainframe business and about related weakness in the group's software operations.
The IBM executive declined to comment about his stock purchases.
"This goes way beyond token purchases," said Bob Gabele, president of CDA/Investnet, a Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., company that tracks insider activity.
"He seems to believe the fundamentals are there" to justify a higher stock price, Mr. Gabele added.
"His buys are a classic `averaging-up' case, where insiders make significant commitments at successively higher prices."
And, he points out, Mr. Gerstner doesn't seem daunted by mild price setbacks after his purchases: he has used them as buying opportunities.
Mr. Gerstner's earlier purchases of IBM stock since his arrival from RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. include a 1,000-share acquisition on April 23 at an average $48.19 a share; a 500-share buy at $48.75 on April 28; a 1,000-share buy at $49.13 on May 3; a 15,000-share grab on Aug. 2 at an average $44.75; a 2,500-share buy, on a further dip in the stock's price, at $41.88 on Aug. 12; and a 5,000 share purchase for $50 a share on Nov. 10, SEC data show.
A handful of other IBM executives and directors have been nibbling at the company's shares, but far less aggressively.
Chief Financial Officer Jerome York bought 5,000 shares at $49.50 a piece on Nov. 9, following a purchase of 7,500 shares at an average $42.13 in early August.
Vice Presidents Robeli Libero and Gerald Czarnecki picked up 1,000 shares and 5,000 shares, respectively, at $42 a share each on Sept. 23.
Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh says that the company's shift in its product mix from mainframes toward personal computers has caused sharp swings in profitability of late but that the trend for the company's bottom line and its share price will be upward.
"We can assume that the decline in large-systems profitability has essentially been neutralized by the company's reduction in capacity and operating expenses," he said.
"We may be at a point where accomplishment in PCs and workstations can now show up in the bottom line."
