Burger King, as part of an expected streamlining, said it will eliminate 350 jobs out of 1,300 corporate staff positions world-wide beginning next month.
The Miami-based fast-food unit of London's Grand Metropolitan PLC said many of those losing their current jobs may be reassigned as part of 250 jobs that are being added simultaneously in the field.
It said the cuts will extend through most of the staff organization and could take up to a year to complete.
The field-support personnel will double world-wide while Burger King reduces the office staff, the company said.
The cuts are part of Chief Executive Officer James B. Adamson's extensive plan to cut costs, reduce staff, improve service and pare menu offerings.
