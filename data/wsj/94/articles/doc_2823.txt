Federal safety regulators have begun a preliminary investigation into a possible defect in 200,000 1992-1993 Saturn sedans and coupes.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in Washington began what it calls a "preliminary evaluation" of the mounts after receiving three complaints from Saturn customers.
At issue is whether failure of the mounts to hold the engines in place properly could cause engine failure.
A spokesman for General Motors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary said the company does not yet have any detailed information from regulators about the inquiry, but believes its vehicles are safe.
A preliminary evaluation is the first stage in the NHTSA process leading to a possible recall, and it usually involves requesting information from manufacturers.
The NHTSA inquiry first was reported in the Detroit News.
