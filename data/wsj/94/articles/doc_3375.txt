A strategy of introducing more fashionable clothing helped propel Gap Inc.'s fiscal fourth-quarter profit up 66%, indicating that the once high-flying company is emerging from a recent slump.
In the quarter ended Jan. 29, Gap reported net income of $109.3 million, or 75 cents a share, up from year-ago earnings of $65.7 million, or 46 cents a share.
Sales rose 14% to $1.06 billion from $930.2 million.
The strong results reminded some analysts of the 1991 fourth quarter when Gap "really knocked the cover off the ball," said analyst Robert Buchanan, of Alex. Brown & Sons.
"People thought they'd never again attain that kind of level."
Encouraged investors sent the stock up $1.125 to $46.125 in Big Board trading yesterday afternoon.
Gap has struggled as consumers tired of its basic unisex clothing and as copy-cat competitors sold similar items for less.
The company had to mark down much of its clothing while inventory piled up.
The San Francisco-based retailer began to reinvent itself in the fall, however, offering such uncharacteristically fashionable items as velvet leggings.
Gap had a "very successful transition into fashion at just the time the consumer was looking for some," said analyst Thomas Tashjian, of First Manhattan.
Snazzier items, such as leather vests and long, crepe skirts, are turning over more quickly and selling at a higher profit margin than Gap's basic commodity apparel.
The company also is marking down fewer items because it lowered inventory per square foot by 20% in the quarter.
As a result, Gap's gross margin -- the difference between the cost of goods and the goods sold -- climbed a whopping 650 basis points from the 1992 fourth quarter.
Although Gap doesn't break down results by division, analysts project that same-store sales -- those at stores opened at least a year -- rose 12% at the GapKids division, and 2% at both Banana Republic and the flagship Gap units.
For the year, Gap's net income rose 23% to $258.4 million, or $1.78 a share, from $210.7 million, or $1.47 a share, in the prior year.
Sales rose 11% to $3.3 billion from $2.96 billion.
The 1,370-store retailer plans to expand rapidly in 1994, with 185 to 200 new stores, and as many as 45 more of its warehouse-concept stores, now called Old Navy Clothing Co., which sell lower-priced lines.
