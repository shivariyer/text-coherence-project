Ryland Group Inc. said it plans to change its focus in California by building homes targeted at the entry-level home buyer to take advantage of low interest rates.
The homebuilder, which markets under the Brock and Larchmont names in California, has focused on more expensive housing.
In the third quarter, Ryland decided to take a $40 million reserve on its home-building inventories in Southern California, reflecting withdrawal from higher-end building, which has been hit hard by high land costs.
