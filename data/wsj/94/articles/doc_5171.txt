Employers who have studied elder care in the workplace have developed some strategies for coping.
Some utopian ideas of the 1980s, such as building on-site adult day-care centers, have mostly fallen out of favor.
Instead, employers are embracing less costly alternatives aimed at giving employees information and job flexibility to resolve eldercare crises without missing much work.
Here are a few strategies:
-- EMPLOYEE SEMINARS: Brown-bag lunches and seminars are aimed at helping workers plan for elder-care needs.
Work/Family Directions Inc., a Boston consulting firm, gave 575 elder-care seminars for clients' employees last year, up 27% from 1992, on such topics as choosing a nursing home, paying for elder care and legal issues raised by aging.
-- RESOURCE AND REFERRAL: Hot lines offer advice on such issues as nursing-home alternatives, home safety for elders, helping aged relatives from afar, and legal and financial planning.
The Partnership Group, Lansdale, Pa., offers referrals to lawyers who help unravel Medicare foul-ups.
Working Solutions Inc., Portland, Ore., provides case managers who work with employees.
Resource and referral services cost about $8 to $13 per eligible employee per year.
-- FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING: Flexible scheduling is a mainstay of elder-care programs.
U S West Inc. says its surveys show flexibility is what employees want most because it lets them solve problems privately without falling behind at work.
Continental Corp. encourages managers to follow a "rule of flexibility," experimenting with work arrangements to solve eldercare problems, says John P. Mascotte, chairman and chief executive.
The result: An unusually high 14% of Continental's non-headquarters employees are on reduced hours and work at home.
Some others work flextime or other schedules.
