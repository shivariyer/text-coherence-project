Alleged cases of "vitamin abuse" are extremely rare, but have been trumpeted about recently by the FDA as it seeks to restrict our access to vitamins and food supplements.
Please don't allow yourselves to become an unwitting pawn in the FDA's dangerous power grab.
The lives and well-being of millions of us are at stake.
You pointed out the widespread painkiller abuse going on in American offices.
I am shocked to see bottles of Tylenol on many executives' desks, where they yield frequent doses.
There is something very wrong with this situation, and your reporter hit it right.
But please, don't confuse vitamins with painkillers.
One is a food, the other a drug.
