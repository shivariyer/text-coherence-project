Nippondenso Co., Japan's largest producer of electronic and electrical parts for autos, reported that unconsolidated pretax profit for 1993 tumbled 37%.
Pretax profit fell to 41.63 billion yen ($384 million) from 65.79 billion yen in 1992.
Net income dropped 43% to 19.73 billion yen from 34.29 billion yen.
Sales declined 6.5% to 1.27 trillion yen from 1.358 trillion yen.
Nippondenso is the second-largest company in the Toyota Motor group, exceeded only by the flagship auto maker Toyota Motor Corp.
It is 24% owned by Toyota.
The earnings drop was the third straight year of decline for the company.
A spokesman said a decline in domestic auto sales cut into the company's profitability.
Also damping its profit was the continued tendency of consumers to buy cheaper autos, which reduced sales of Nippondenso's highly profitable value-added automotive parts, the official said.
For the current year, Nippondenso is predicting pretax profit will rise 0.9% to 42 billion yen.
The spokesman said efforts to restructure are expected to bear fruit, and the company sees demand for automotive parts perking up in the autumn.
But it sees the current severe business environment continuing at least until April or May.
