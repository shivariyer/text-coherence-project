Fast-food chain Arby's Inc., a unit of Triarc Co., said it will impose a no-smoking policy this summer in all of its company-owned restaurants.
The move is the latest in a string of efforts by Triarc to polish the image of Arby's and its three other core businesses.
Arby's, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has 2,248 restaurants in the U.S., of which 257 are company-owned.
Triarc also has interests in soft-drink manufacturing, textiles and propane gas.
The smoke-free policy was announced in Washington at a forum on the health risks of passive smoking sponsored by the attorneys general of 16 states, who are pushing fast-food chains to adopt no-smoking policies.
Last July, Minneapolis-based Dairy Queen urged its franchisees to adopt a non-smoking policy.
All contracts for new stores contain a no-smoking clause.
About three-fourths of the 4,862 Dairy Queen outlets have indoor seating.
