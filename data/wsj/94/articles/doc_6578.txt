Owens-Illinois Inc. said it is slashing its U.S. work force by 10%, or 2,000 employees, and taking a charge of $355 million, or $2.98 a share, for the 1993 fourth quarter.
On a pretax basis, the charge totals $575 million and includes $250 million for restructuring and $325 million to handle future asbestos claims.
Analysts had expected earnings of as much as five cents a share; the charges are expected to push the company sharply into the loss column when it announces its earnings next week.
The one-time restructuring charge includes severance and early retirement costs, and costs of streamlining factory operations, Owens-Illinois said.
The restructuring program will result in annual pretax saving of $75 million or more beginning in 1994, the company said.
The restructuring grew out of a "comprehensive re-engineering study" in the fourth quarter and is designed to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance customer service, the glass and plastic packaging manufacturer said in a statement.
The work force cutbacks will hit an estimated 2,000 hourly workers at 21 glass packaging plants throughout the U.S., the company said.
The company's overseas operations won't be affected by the cutbacks.
Separately, the company took a charge of $325 million to account for anticipated asbestos lawsuit claims.
The number of cases pending against the company has been reduced from a high of 92,000 in 1991 to 43,000 as of Dec. 31, 1993.
Altogether, the company has disposed of 143,000 cases, including 31,000 in 1993, it said.
"The cost of some settlements has been higher than expected," said Thomas L. Young, Owens-Illinois executive vice president and general counsel, but "we have cut our case backlog in half and significantly reduced our exposure to high-cost claims."
The company may need to take additional charges if it loses a pending New Jersey case in which it is seeking coverage under insurance policies for asbestos claims.
But one analyst praised the way the company is reducing its manufacturing costs and its outstanding asbestos liabilities, which stem from a business unit the company sold in 1958.
"This is going to add big time to their earnings" said Joel G. Tiss, an analyst with Lehman Bros.
"This is very positive for the company."
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Owen-Illinois shares rose 25 cents apiece to $11.875.
