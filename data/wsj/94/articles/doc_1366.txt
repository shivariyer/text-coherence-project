Autotote Corp.'s stock fell 8% as strong earnings gains for the first fiscal quarter failed to stand up to analyst's forecasts.
For the period ended Jan. 31, the Newark, Del., maker of computerized wagering equipment, said net income soared to $1.9 million, or six cents a share, from $615,000, or three cents a share, for the year-earlier period.
Revenue more than doubled to $26.9 million.
Analysts had predicted net income would be as high as eight cents a share for the first quarter.
In Nasdaq trading, Autotote shares fell $2.375 to $26.25.
Autotote cited seasonality in its core business -- parimutuel wagering equipment and facilities management to race tracks, off-track wagering, lotteries and legalized sports betting facilities.
The company said profit was also influenced by the severe cold weather in the Northeast and the earthquake in California.
