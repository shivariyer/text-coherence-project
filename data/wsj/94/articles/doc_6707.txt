Cie. Financiere de Paribas, Paris, estimated yesterday that its 1993 group net income rose 58% to 1.4 billion francs ($238 million) from 886 million francs in 1992.
Paribas Chairman Andre Levy-Lang attributed much of the increase to a strong performance of capital-market operations and banking operations of the group's Banque Paribas unit.
Paribas said that its industrial portfolio contributed little to group profit in 1993, because there were few major asset sales.
Nevertheless, it said latent capital gains in its industrial portfolio, which was valued at 40 billion francs at the end of 1993, amount to 10 billion francs.
The value of the company's financial portfolio is estimated at 20 billion francs.
