Concord Fabrics Inc. said it agreed to purchase all the capital stock of Kat-Em International Inc.
Kat-Em is a closely held importer and distributor of woven and knitted fabrics.
Concord said Jan Rose, Kat-Em's selling shareholder, will be president of the company under a five-year employment agreement.
Concord Fabrics, New York, said it expects the transaction to close next month, subject to certain conditions.
Kat-Em's sales in 1993 were about $25 million.
