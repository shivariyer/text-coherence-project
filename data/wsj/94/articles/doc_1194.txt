German chemical group Hoechst AG said its parent-company operations swung to a 1993 operating loss of 217 million marks ($128 million) from a 1992 operating profit of 234 million marks.
Hoechst's full-group operating profit, including all its subsidiaries, slumped 31% to 1.48 billion marks in 1993 from 2.15 billion marks in 1992.
The company said operating results fell partly because of rising restructuring and layoff expenses, which rose to 999 million marks in 1993 from 771 million marks a year earlier.
World-wide employment declined to 172,483 in 1993 from 177,668 a year earlier.
Staff at the parent company dropped to 54,255 from 57,885.
