Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Travelers Inc. confirmed they were holding talks about combining their health-care operations, saying the talks were "exploratory in nature."
The combination would create one of the country's largest health insurance and managed care operations.
Met and Travelers, although large health insurers, have a smaller presence in managed care than rival insurers Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Cigna Corp. and Aetna Life & Casualty Co.
Analysts say by combining their health-care businesses, they would come closer to achieving the critical mass necessary to compete in managed care.
A company statement said: "Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Travelers Inc. confirmed today that the two companies are engaged in discussions concerning possible alliances among their health-care operations.
The companies said the discussions were exploratory in nature and it would be premature to speculate on the outcome if any."
