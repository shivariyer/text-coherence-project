New York Times Co. reported a fourth-quarter net loss due to a number of one-time charges, but turned in operating profit that topped most analysts' estimates.
The publishing company had a loss of $24.1 million, or 23 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a net loss of $3.7 million, or five cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue for the quarter rose 36% to $636 million from $468.2 million, boosted partly by the October 1993 acquisition of the Boston Globe.
New York Times Co. had already forewarned analysts about the fourth quarter's pretax charge of $30 million to cover severance pay and related costs for a planned white-collar staff cutback.
There were several other minor charges in the quarter, plus an unexpected $47 million after-tax charge, effectively a write-down of assets in the company's Forest Products Group.
The company owns 50% of three paper mills and said it is revaluing the mills based on current market conditions, including a world-wide newsprint glut.
Looking past the short-term charges, analysts saw evidence of a solid turnaround in advertising sales.
"We believe the worst is certainly over for the New York Times newspaper company," said Kenneth Berents, media analyst with Wheat First Butcher & Singer in Richmond, Va.
Lanny Baker, media analyst with Salomon Bros., cited an increase of almost 8% in advertising linage at the Times for the fourth quarter, whereas ad linage for the full year rose only 1%.
At the Boston Globe, ad linage rose nearly 10% in the quarter.
"Operating profit at the newspaper division was up 50% even after the amortization and depreciation from the Globe acquisition," said Mr. Baker, "which shows that cash flows are pretty darn strong."
Also, operating profit doubled in the company's magazine group for the quarter, to $4.9 million from $2.4 million, and operating profit also rose in the broadcast/information services group, to $5.8 million from $4.1 million.
For the full year, New York Times Co. reported net income of $6.1 million, or seven cents a share, compared with a net loss of $44.7 million, or 57 cents a share.
The year-ago figures include a pretax loss of $53.8 million, or 47 cents a share, due to the closing of the Gwinnett (Ga.)

Revenue for 1993 rose to $2.02 billion from $1.77 billion.
