SofTech Inc., Waltham, Mass., reporting the first quarter after shedding its defense business, will post sharply higher profit from continuing operations for the fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28.
Revenue from continuing operations rose 66%, Norman Rasmussen, chief executive and president, said in an interview.
SofTech also will take a one-time gain of $1 million in the third quarter, from the sale of the defense-software business last December, Mr. Rasmussen said.
Before the gain, profit from continuing operations was $349,000, or nine cents a share, on revenue of $6.2 million, he said.
In the year-earlier quarter, income restated to account for the exit from the defense business was $25,000, or one cent a share, on revenue of $3.7 million.
Net income after the one-time gain was $1.37 million, or 36 cents a share, he said.
With the exit from defense, SofTech is rebuilding itself as a networking, software-services and systems-integration business, Mr. Rasmussen said.
SofTech is looking for acquisitions of regional computer distributors and service firms to accomplish this, he said.
