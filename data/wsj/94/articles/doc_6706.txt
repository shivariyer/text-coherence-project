Continental Airlines' net loss widened to $26.5 million, or $1.47 a share, in the fourth quarter, from $13.9 million a year earlier.
The carrier attributed the results to lower capacity due to the withdrawal of 11 planes from its fleet for overhauls.
The per-share figure for the 1992 quarter isn't available because the Houston company has restated its results and adopted fresh-start accounting since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection last April.
Continental's chief executive officer, Robert R. Ferguson III, said in a statement that "we are never satisfied with a net loss, but we are confident that the necessary elements are coming together and will produce significantly better results in the future."
Continental posted an operating profit for the quarter of $8.5 million, compared with an operating loss of $43.6 million a year earlier.
Revenue edged up to $1.37 billion from $1.34 billion.
Mr. Ferguson cited the introduction last fall of low-fare, short-haul service, primarily in the Southeast.
