The Justice Department is considering allegations that the American Bar Association's standards for accrediting law schools may violate antitrust laws by unnecessarily increasing costs.
The Massachusetts School of Law has complained to federal officials that the bar association's accrediting policies function as a cartel designed to keep faculty costs, and therefore student costs, high.
Lawrence Velvel, dean of the law school, said the school notified Justice Department officials shortly after the school filed suit against the accrediting policies in November.
Since then, Bruce Pierson, a lawyer in the department's Antitrust Division, has contacted various law-school officials to inquire about the accrediting practices.
The bar association's designated spokesman on the accreditation issue couldn't be reached for comment.
The antitrust inquiry was reported by the National Law Journal.
