Golden West Financial Corp. said it has given up its bid to acquire California Federal Bank.
Herbert M. Sandler, Golden West's chairman and chief executive, said that negotiations with CalFed faltered over CalFed's refusal to let Golden West examine its books.
CalFed couldn't be reached for comment.
Last December, Golden West proposed to acquire CalFed, a Los Angeles based concern with $15.7 billion in assets and a string of losses, for $21.50 a share, or $537.50 million, plus $90 million for preferred stock.
CalFed declined the offering, saying that it was not for sale.
Last month Golden West made another attempt, offering a speculative security to bridge the difference in the two banks' valuation of CalFed.
