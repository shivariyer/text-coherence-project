First Fidelity Bancorp. said it will purchase Baltimore Bancorp for $346 million, advancing the strategy of extending its franchise from Maryland to Massachusetts.
Under the agreement, First Fidelity will pay a hefty premium for the parent company of the Bank of Baltimore.
The acquisition price amounts to 2.1 times the bank's book value, according to Nancy A. Bush, a regional bank analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
"It's aggressive," said James J. McDermott Jr., president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
"It's a big price, and it takes First Fidelity into a new market."
"It gets them out of the New Jersey rut," Ms. Bush added, referring to an economic downturn in the state that started with the decline of real estate values and may continue with layoffs by American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
Baltimore Bancorp, with assets of $2.2 billion, has been actively marketing itself for several months.
In 1991, Edwin F. Hale Sr., the bank's current chairman and chief executive, led a proxy fight that resulted in the ouster of the bank's management, which had wanted to remain independent.
At the time, Mr. Hale said he would help the bank recover its financial health with an eye toward its eventual sale.
First Fidelity, which has $33.8 billion in assets, will pay $20.75 in cash for Baltimore Bancorp's common shares.
The bank expects to complete the purchase by the end of this year.
