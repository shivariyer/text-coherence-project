Tejas Power Corp. said it agreed to sell a 50% stake in a natural-gas storage facility to a unit of CMS Energy Corp., Dearborn, Mich.
Terms weren't disclosed for the sale, which is retroactive to Jan. 1.
Tejas, a Houston natural-gas concern, said it is selling half-ownership in its Moss Bluff Gas Storage Systems operations to CMS Energy's natural-gas pipeline unit, CMS Gas Transmission & Storage Co.
The Moss Bluff facility, 60 miles east of Houston, provides 4.9 billion cubic feet of natural-gas storage in two underground caverns.
The two companies also agreed to develop an additional four billion cubic feet of storage capacity in a third cavern at Moss Bluff.
