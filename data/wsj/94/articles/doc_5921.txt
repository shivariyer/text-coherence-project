New Hampshire's attorney general Jeffrey R. Howard said Hadco Corp. agreed to pay $157,000 in concessions to settle state claims that it violated state hazardous-waste laws.
The settlement follows a state investigation of a Hadco hazardous-waste spill at its Hudson, N.H., facility in May 1989, in which ammoniacal etch solution spilled into a storm drain leading to a tributary of a river.
Although Hadco cleaned up the spill, the state found Hadco violated a number of hazardous-waste rules, including storage, discharge, reporting and personnel-training requirements.
Under the terms of the settlement, under which Hadco admits no liability, the company will pay $30,000 in cash to the state's hazardous-waste cleanup fund and spend at least $126,700 on pollution-prevention projects over the next year.
Hadco officials weren't available to comment.
Hadco in Salem, N.H., makes printed circuit boards.
