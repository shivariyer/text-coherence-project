Coca-Cola Co. said it will increase 1994 capital spending by 50% to $1.2 billion, largely for international projects.
The Atlanta-based soft drink company also boosted its dividend 15% to 19.5 cents, payable on April 1 to holders of record March 15.
In 1993, Coca-Cola's capital spending was about $800 million.
Analysts said the increased budget was in line with expectations.
About 73% of the 1994 budget is for international soft-drink operations, including about $200 million in new markets of China and East Central Europe, the company said.
Analysts said they expect Coca-Cola to spend the money on vending machines, fountain equipment and other projects to support expansion of its brands in new markets.
