Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., the flagship group of billionaire Li Ka-shing, said it wouldn't rule out a spinoff of its China units, but that it has no immediate plans to do so.
In a brief statement to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Friday, Cheung Kong said, "the company does not rule out the possibility of spinning off its China businesses in the future.
The company is fully aware of the listing requirements of the stock exchange and has no immediate plans for the spinoff."
Cheung Kong said investors should exercise caution in dealing in its shares.
Cheung Kong, which controls the listed conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., has wide-ranging interests on mainland China, in industries such as property, container handling and cement.
Mr. Li also is considered politically well-connected in China.
