SHAW INDUSTRIES Inc., a carpet company, had earnings of roughly 12 cents a share for its fiscal third quarter last year, after adjustment for a 2-for-1 stock split paid in December.
In yesterday's Abreast of the Market column, the figure was incorrectly reported as 23 cents, which doesn't take into account the stock split.
HERITAGE MEDIA Corp.'s two biggest shareholders filed plans to sell their combined 23% stake in a public offering that could total more than $70 million.
An article yesterday incorrectly valued the offering at more than $300 million.
