Crop damage and property losses from last summer's devastating floods pushed down personal income in 10 Midwestern and Western states during last year's third quarter, the Commerce Department said.
Income in the states also fell because of declines in federal farm subsidies.
Income fell most steeply, by 7.1%, in North Dakota.
It also dropped in Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Arizona.
Personal income increased in all other states except Vermont, where it fell 0.1% as factory layoffs and a construction slowdown reduced payrolls.
For the nation as a whole, personal income increased a modest 0.7%.
It was held back by weak manufacturing, particularly in autos, which has since improved.
Drought in the Southeast also hurt farm income.
