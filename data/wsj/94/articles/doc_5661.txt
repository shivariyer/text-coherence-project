Olympic Airways, the state-operated national carrier, will receive a $142 million bank loan to cover a growing deficit in its 1994 operating budget.
Newspapers reported that the loan, granted by three state-owned banks, will cover an expected deficit in Olympic's operating budget from December 1993 until the end of April.
