An Anadarko Petroleum Corp. unit said it had a second oil discovery in the Sahara desert in Algeria.
The HBN No. 1 well, in the Ghadames Basin on Block 404, was drilled to a total depth of 11,251 feet and flowed at a rate of 4,900 barrels per day of 42 degrees API gravity crude oil and 6.3 million cubic feet of gas per day, through a 3/4-inch choke with 1,330 pounds per square inch of flowing tubing pressure.
Perforations were between 10,621 and 10,732 feet.
Partners in the venture include Anadarko Algeria Corp. and Sonatrach, the national oil and gas enterprise of Algeria, and others.
Anadarko Petroleum is a natural-gas and crude oil exploration and production company.
Sonatrach owns 10.2% of Anadarko's common stock.
