Bell Atlantic Corp. said it will invest at least $250 million over five years to link public schools, medical facilities and government offices in Delaware using a sophisticated fiber-optic network.
The Philadelphia-based regional phone company's announcement comes at a time when legislation is moving through Congress that would require companies to provide inexpensive computer linkups to schools, medical institutions, libraries and some public buildings.
Although some telephone and cable companies have balked at providing such services free, a few companies, including Bell Atlantic, have generally supported the idea.
In return for connecting various institutions, Delaware has granted Bell Atlantic the right to provide flexible -- and more competitive -- pricing for certain telecommunications services, like Yellow Pages, according to a company spokesman.
Bell Atlantic's efforts are part of a larger plan to diversify and provide simultaneous voice, data and video services over regular telephone lines to customers in Delaware by 1996.
