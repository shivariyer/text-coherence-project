Whirlpool Corp. said it raised to 72% from 49% its stake in Whirlpool Tatramat, its Poprad, Slovakia, joint-venture with Tatramat AS.
Whirlpool Tatramat makes and sells washing machines and markets other major home appliances in the Czech and Slovak Republics.
The joint venture was formed in November 1991 and was Whirlpool's first significant industrial move into Central Europe, it said.
The majority stake, the company said, will enable it to play a greater role in developing and supplying its markets in Central and Eastern Europe.
Whirlpool, a home-appliance maker, added that the increased investment will allow it to consider expanding its manufacturing base into other products and to enhance its presence in Eastern and Central Europe.
