Syntex Corp. said net income for its second quarter, ended Jan. 31, skidded 20% to $95.8 million, or 43 cents a share.
The results were in line with analysts' estimates, but Syntex stock still slipped 37.5 cents to close at $13.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The Palo Alto, Calif., pharmaceutical concern has been expected to struggle because of the expiration of patents on two flagship products, naprosyn and anaprox, both of which are anti-inflammatory drugs.
Those patents expired in December.
Since then, makers of rival versions of the drugs have been chewing into Syntex's market share; indeed, Syntex said the erosion of its market share has been somewhat more rapid than expected.
Sales for the second quarter dropped 3% to $489.1 million from $505.5 million.
In the year-earlier quarter, Syntex earned $119.1 million, or 54 cents a share.
