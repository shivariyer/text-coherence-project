Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, Calif., reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $10.2 million, putting the company in violation of certain debt covenants.
The loss included $16 million of charges related to, among other things, continuing consolidation of the company's medical laboratories in certain regions.
The net loss was equal to 61 cents a share.
In the year-earlier quarter, the company had net income of $1.9 million, or 11 cents a share.
Revenue fell 3% to $68.3 million from $70.5 million.
The company said discussions with debtholders are under way, covering the company's $65 million of debt held by three insurance companies.
The lenders would like to change certain terms to improve their "comfort level," said George Bragg, Nichols president and chief executive officer.
Nichols Institute's cash flow, liquidity and "the basic business" are all good, he said, adding that the company hasn't missed any debt payments.
