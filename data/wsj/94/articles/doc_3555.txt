U.K. motor company Vickers PLC "turned the corner" in 1993, swinging to a #32.3 million ($48.1 million) pretax profit from a #36.6 million loss in 1992.
Vickers, crediting the strength of its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. division, showed the profit despite a 4% drop in sales to #689.6 million from #718.5 million.
The result was in line with market forecasts.
Vickers doubled its full-year dividend to three pence a share.
Market forecasts estimate Vickers's 1994 pretax profit will rise to #41.3 million.
Vickers's recent restructuring, in which its defense operations were pooled into a separate division, created a "more streamlined" company, said Richard Lloyd, Vickers's chairman.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, which returned to profit last year as earlier reported, is healthier and more efficient than any time in its history, company officials said.
On the defense side, the company cited previously reported orders of Challenger 2 tanks from Oman and the U.K. Ministry of Defense.
The division's order book will rise by more than #600 million because of the orders, the company said.
