GALVESTON-HOUSTON Co., Houston, said its board approved a special dividend of shares of its Bettis Corp. subsidiary, spinning off that unit to shareholders.
Under the plan, Galveston-Houston stockholders will receive one share of Bettis for every two common shares of Galveston-Houston they own.
Galveston-Houston makes and sells construction and mining products; Bettis makes and sells valve actuators.
As part of the plan, which hinges on receiving a favorable tax opinion and is subject to regulatory approval, Galveston-Houston said it won't continue its one-cent dividend.
