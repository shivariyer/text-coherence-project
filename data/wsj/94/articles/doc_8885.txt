American Health Properties Inc. said it agreed to fund $30 million of an $86 million first mortgage loan on a hospital and medical office building in Austin, Texas.
The real-estate investment trust said it already has funded about $7 million of its commitment and will pay the balance over the rest of the construction period.
Completion of the 670,000-square-foot facility is expected in June 1995.
The loan was originated by National Health Investors Inc. of Murfreesboro, Tenn.
