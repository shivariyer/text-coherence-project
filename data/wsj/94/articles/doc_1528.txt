Docks de France SA, a food retail concern, said its net group profit before exceptional items rose 17% to 433 million francs ($75.3 million) in 1993 from 371 million francs in 1992.
Docks de France is boosting its net per-share dividend to 11 francs from 9.5 francs paid out last year.
Consolidated revenue gained 20% to 38.3 billion francs from 32.1 billion.
The group noted that the figures for the latest year reflect the purchase of Societe Alsacienne de Supermarches in 1993, which was consolidated as of the second half.
