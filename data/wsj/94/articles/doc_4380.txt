It was disappointing to read your Feb. 1 editorial referring to 13 bureaucrats on the Ozone Transport Commission.
In fact, the so-called bureaucrats are the designees of the governors of 12 Eastern states and the mayor of the District of Columbia.
The vote with which the Ozone Transport Commission adopted a compromise will foster the creation of more jobs in these states because the ratio of pollution caused by mobile sources to industrial sources will change, enabling the creation of more industries as we clean up tailpipe pollution with low-emission and zero-emission vehicles.
It is far more likely that the public would be angry at individuals and industries that continue to pollute our air and cost us jobs than it would be at state governments that work together to clean up the environment and enable us to have better paying industrial jobs in the ozone transport states.
