Over the past several years you have persistently portrayed me as an advocate of a tough trade policy toward Japan, a country that I am said to believe is "different," unfair and unchanging.
The most recent example is your Dec. 29 article "Japan, Economically and Politically Ailing, Is Sinking into Gloom."
For the record, I do not believe, nor have I ever said, that Japan is unfair.
I do believe that Japan's economic philosophy differs fundamentally from that of the U.S. and that its economy is structured and run on a significantly different basis.
The whole point of explaining these differences is to demonstrate that U.S. problems with Japan do not arise from unfairness on Japan's part, but rather from misunderstanding of what drives Japan on the part of the U.S.
I have never said that Japan will not or cannot change.
Indeed, I have said that Japan has changed more over the past 40 years than perhaps any other country.
The problem here is that when most commentators talk about a changing Japan, they implicitly assume that Japan will change to become more like the U.S.
That may indeed happen, but I believe it is equally possible for Japan to change without becoming more like the U.S.
I do not advocate a tough trade policy toward Japan.
Tough implies threats and retaliation.
I am on record in public testimony as being against such threats and retaliation, and I have testified against the use of unfair trade laws such as Super 301.
I do advocate an intelligent trade policy toward Japan that recognizes that negotiating with Japan over philosophical concepts such as openness and fairness may be unproductive because of vastly different understandings of those concepts on both sides.
Negotiation of concrete and measurable objectives easily understood by both countries should obviate the need for toughness.
