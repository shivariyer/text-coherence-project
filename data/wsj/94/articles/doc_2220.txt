Dibrell Brothers Inc., Danville, Va., said it acquired 6.2% of the common stock in Standard Commercial Corp. for a total of about $7 million in open-market purchases over several months.
Dibrell and Standard had agreed in principle to combine the companies in March 1993, but Standard's board terminated the agreement a month later.
Both companies are international leaf-tobacco processers and dealers; Dibrell is also a dealer of fresh-cut flowers, and Standard, based in Wilson, N.C., also processes and deals in wool.
Claude B. Owen Jr., Dibrell's chairman and chief executive officer, said his company continues to believe that a combination of the two "would create opportunities to improve customer service and asset utilization, reduce costs and increase shareholder value."
Dibrell said that it may expand its investment in Standard from time to time through open-market or private purchases, but that it doesn't currently anticipate an unfriendly bid for Standard.
