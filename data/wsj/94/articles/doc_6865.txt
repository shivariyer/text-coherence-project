French car maker Renault SA sold a 4.85% stake of AB Volvo, the Swedish company with which a planned merger had failed.
Renault said it now holds 3.45% of Volvo capital and 8.76% of its voting rights.
It previously held 8.3% of the capital and 9.99% of the voting rights.
Renault had built up its stake in Volvo gradually, buying its shares on the open market until September.
The shareholding was characterized as an investment and wasn't related to the cross-shareholding agreements that cemented the industrial alliance between the two car groups.
Under these accords, the Swedish group took a 20% shareholding in Renault SA and 45% of Renault's truck division Renault Vehicules Industriels, or RVI.
The remainder of Renault's shares are held by the French government.
In return, Renault acquired 25% of Volvo's car division, and 45% of Volvo Trucks.
According to unofficial estimates, Renault made a profit of close to 750 million francs ($127.5 million) from the sale of its stake.
Renault sold 3.2 million AB Volvo shares at 655 kronor ($82.99) on Tuesday for a total amount of 2.1 billion kronor.
