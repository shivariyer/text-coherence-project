Coltec Industries Inc. said its Fairbanks Morse Engine division agreed to acquire the equipment and assets of a General Electric Co.'s Alco engine business.
Under the agreement, Fairbanks Morse will make and sell engines and other aftermarket parts for Alco diesel engines used in power plants and marine markets.
GE, also of New York, will retain the right to sell and market those items for its locomotive markets.
Separately, New York-based Coltec, which makes aerospace, automotive and industrial products, said its automotive division will supply air pumps to Isuzu Motors Ltd. for use in Rodeo and Trooper sports models and a pickup truck.
The company expects to ship about 30,000 air pumps a year.
Terms of the agreements weren't disclosed.
Coltec also makes the pumps, which are used to reduce engine emissions, for Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
