Nestle SA, Zurich, said that sales in 1993 climbed 5.4% to 57.5 billion Swiss francs ($39.37 billion) from 54.5 billion francs in 1992, and that earnings for the year were higher as well.
The sales figures for 1993 were in line with expectations expressed at a news conference in November by Chairman Helmut Maucher.
He said at the time that profit and sales were both expected to rise about 5% in the year.
Final 1993 earnings figures, as well as the proposed dividend payout, will be announced March 24.
The giant Swiss food and beverage company also said it expects an increase in sales and profit for 1994, "unless the recession in Europe deepens, and provided exchange rates don't take a very unfavorable turn vis-a-vis the Swiss franc."
Consolidation of companies acquired during 1993 caused sales to climb 3%, the company said.
It added that it saw "good volume growth, especially in Asia and Latin America, but also in North America."
Overall growth in sales volume, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, rose 1.7%, Nestle said.
It added that the growth rate accelerated starting last fall.
