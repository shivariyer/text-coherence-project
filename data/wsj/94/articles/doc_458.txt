I'm glad you published a list of those representatives (mine was among them) who voted to exclude themselves from the grasp of the, admittedly imprudent, independent prosecutor law ("Everyone but Congress," Review & Outlook, March 1).
Your title brings to mind all of those other laws made by Congress that apply not merely to the executive branch, but to everyone but Congress.
My American Politics students were more animated in their interest in Publius' defense of the Constitution of 1787 when he warned them that a law that did not bind Congress as it did the rest of the nation ought to be feared as tyranny itself.
In Federalist No. 57, Publius (here James Madison) continues to answer the objection against our Constitution that the House of Representatives is an unsafe repository for the greatest political authority in the nation; the fifth of his five arguments against this objection rests on the presumption that members of Congress would never make a law that did not apply to themselves as to everyone else.
He then poses the following hypothetical question:
"If it be asked, what is to restrain the House of Representatives from making legal discriminations in favor of themselves and a particular class of the society, I answer: the genius of the whole system; the nature of just and constitutional laws; and, above all, the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates the people of America -- a spirit which nourishes freedom, and in return is nourished by it.
If this spirit shall ever be so far debased as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature, as well as on the people, the people will be prepared to tolerate anything but liberty."
As you point out, Congress has made such laws over and over again.
As you ran that piece directly under a related one called "Presumption of Rascality," perhaps you could have called it, "Presumption of Tyranny."
