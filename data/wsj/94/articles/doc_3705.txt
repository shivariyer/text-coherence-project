Tide West Oil Co. expects to report net income of about 16 cents a share for the fourth quarter, Philip B. Smith, the company's president, said.
In the year-ago quarter, Tide West reported net income of $2.4 million, or 46 cents a share, on revenue of $6.1 million.
Although net income appears to have plunged on a per-share basis, the year-to-year comparison is essentially flat.
The number of shares outstanding increased to 9.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 1993 from 5.3 million a year earlier.
In an interview, Mr. Smith said the Tulsa, Okla., company's strategy of acquiring producing properties, developing what it has and a workover program has been successful, and net proved reserves of natural gas jumped 66.6% to 142.6 billion cubic feet at year-end 1993 from 85.6 billion cubic feet.
Mr. Smith said the company plans to continue acquiring more reserves and developing them.
