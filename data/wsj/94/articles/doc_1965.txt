An early morning fire in a Pacific Bell switching center disrupted telephone service yesterday in the downtown area and some suburban neighborhoods.
Pacific Bell is a unit of Pacific Telesis Group, San Francisco.
The blaze, which took firefighters more than an hour to control, affected some long-distance calls as well as emergency calls to police and fire departments.
As a precaution, helicopters flew over some suburban neighborhoods and fire engines patrolled streets to check for potential emergencies.
Nearly all telephone service was reported back to normal by the afternoon.
The fire on the 13th floor of a downtown office building forced the evacuation of 50 people.
Trading on the Pacific Stock Exchange wasn't affected.
