Most of the nation's businesses are paying their bills a little faster, a survey indicated.
Most businesses showed only modest improvement in bill-paying performance during the fourth quarter, compared to the previous quarter, according to a Dun & Bradstreet Information Services survey.
"Despite the recent glowing reports of economic improvement, many businesses are still under tremendous financial strains," said David Kresge, a D&B vice president.
"Although there was economic expansion in 1993, it was rather erratic.
Gains made in 1992 stalled, or even reversed in 1993."
D&B's quarterly survey is based on payment records of one million companies as reported by their suppliers to Dun & Bradstreet Corp.
The survey compares the length of time it takes companies to pay their bills relative to the previous quarter.
For the three months ended Dec. 31, the survey's index of bill-paying performance was a minus 3.8, which indicates that the percentage of firms paying slower exceeded the percentage paying faster by 3.8 percentage points.
Despite the negative reading, the index rose from the previous quarter's minus 4.3.
The improvement in bill-paying was led by small and midsize companies, while large companies showed no change, the survey shows.
