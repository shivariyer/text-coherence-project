Home Depot Inc. said fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 16%, despite higher expansion costs and bad weather.
For the quarter ended Jan. 30, the Atlanta-based home-improvement retailer reported net income of $112.7 million, or 25 cents a share, up from $97.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales jumped 26% to $2.29 billion from $1.82 billion.
The results were in line with most analysts' expectations.
Home Depot shares rose to $40.125, up $1.125, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Same-store sales rose 6%.
Home Depot said year-earlier results reflected strong sales after Hurricane Andrew.
Otherwise, same-store sales in the just-completed quarter would have risen 9%.
For the year, net jumped 26% to $457.4 million, or $1.01 a share, from $362.9 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 29% to $9.24 billion.
