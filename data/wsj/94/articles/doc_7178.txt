Roche Holding Ltd., a Swiss drug and chemical company, said it has begun a major international study of a new experimental AIDS drug as a result of promising studies in patients completed last year.
Roche, the parent of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., said it will study a drug called R031-8959 in more than 3,000 patients with AIDS in the U.S. and abroad.
The drug is part of a class that deactivates the AIDS virus by blocking an enzyme, called protease, that the virus uses to reproduce.
In recent months, scientific interest in these drugs has increased sharply as five companies, including Merck & Co. and Wellcome PLC, have stepped up efforts to test their versions of the protease blocking drugs.
The race to develop "protease drugs intensified after Roche last year presented preliminary human tests in Europe showing the drug was safe, and appeared to reduce levels of virus in the bloodstream.
Keith Bragman, head of Roche's international program, said the company has moved quickly to organize testing in 90 sites around the world.
"We were quite excited by the initial European results," he said.
"We are the first company to show {in humans} proof" of the concept of blocking the protease enzyme.
The Roche drug is known to be very expensive to synthesize, involving over 21 steps.
Roche said the current study will cost "many millions of dollars," although it declined to be more specific.
