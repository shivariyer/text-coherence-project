Ross Systems Inc., a maker of computer client-server products, reported a loss of $7 million for its fiscal second quarter on a 25% drop in sales attributable to unexpected delays in obtaining expected software licensing contracts.
The loss of 70 cents a share for the period ended Dec. 31 compares with net income of 15 cents a share, or $1.5 million, a year earlier for the Redwood City, Calif., company.
The current results include charges of $5.9 million for restructuring and increasing a reserve to offset slowed account collections.
Sales dropped to $17.2 million from $22.9 million a year earlier.
The loss was expected, because the company previously had announced that the contract delays would hurt quarterly results.
