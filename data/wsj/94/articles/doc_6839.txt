In response to your Jan. 17 editorial "Swarthmore's Confused Correctness": Males should know that "crude amorous persistence" is inappropriate and will not be tolerated.
Where do you draw the line between crude persistence and criminal stalking?
That line remains unclear until a woman has been attacked.
It is better to err in the direction of being overprotective.
Based on your editorial, I support the Swarthmore decision to dismiss the intimidating student.
I doubt that the female student would have gone through the ordeal of pursuing protection from the school administration if she did not feel seriously threatened.
I doubt that the school would have taken this action if it did not believe that there was reason to do so.
