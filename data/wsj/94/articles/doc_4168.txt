A grand jury is investigating allegations that current and former American Honda Motor Co. executives accepted bribes from dealers seeking special treatment from the auto maker, according to the U.S. Attorney General's Office of the District of New Hampshire.
Prosecutors wouldn't comment on whether federal prosecutors are prepared to bring charges against the executives.
"There's not much that prosecutors are permitted to say," said Michael Connolly, assistant U.S. attorney.
"American Honda is cooperating with the investigation."
The allegations of corruption in Honda's marketing operations surfaced in a lawsuit filed in 1989 by a Concord, N.H., Acura dealer.
The dealer charged that Honda ignored his ailing franchise while giving special treatment to a nearby Acura dealer who bribed the district sales manager with a car and money.
Acura is Honda's luxury division.
The allegations of bribery and corruption have spread, and federal prosecutors are conducting a nationwide investigation.
Honda, a unit of Japan's Honda Motor Co., wouldn't comment on the probe.
