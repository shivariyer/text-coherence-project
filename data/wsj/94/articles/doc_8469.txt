Paragon Trade Brands Inc. said it has been named in a patent-infringement lawsuit filed by Procter & Gamble Co. in Delaware federal court regarding certain features of its disposable diapers.
Paragon, a Federal Way, Wash., maker of private-label diapers, said "neither of the two Procter & Gamble patents can be validly construed to cover the company's products."
A representative for Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, wasn't available to comment.
A spokeswoman for Paragon said it hadn't received an official copy of the suit and therefore couldn't comment further.
