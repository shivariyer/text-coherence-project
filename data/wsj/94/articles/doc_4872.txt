Clients of Chemical Banking Corp., whose advertising campaign says "Expect More From Us," at least expect their money.
But for the past two days, thousands of clients in New York City couldn't get at their funds through automatic teller machines because of a computer glitch.
The glitch incorrectly doubled the amount of withdrawals or transfers for any transaction made on Wednesday, so that a $100 withdrawal would show up as a $200 withdrawal.
Unfortunately for customers, it did not double deposits.
The bank said the problem resulted from a routine systems adjustment.
While customers visiting tellers had no problem withdrawing funds, Chemical said it didn't expect to have the computer glitch completely solved until early today .
A Chemical spokesman said that tens of thousands of accounts were affected, although the actual number of people who tried and failed to obtain money from ATMs was probably much smaller than that.
The bank said it would try to ensure that no checks bounced because of its mistake.
"We just messed it up," said the Chemical spokesman.
"We take full responsibility for the mistake."
