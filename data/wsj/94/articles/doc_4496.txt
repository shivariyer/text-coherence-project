The Wall Street boom may be slowing, data released by the New York Stock Exchange indicates.
The Big Board reported yesterday that the aggregate pretax earnings of profitable securities firms in the fourth quarter of 1993 slipped 0.3% to $2.183 billion from $2.189 billion in the third quarter.
However, the fourth-quarter total was still 54% ahead of the $1.421 billion total a year earlier.
For the year, the industry had pretax earnings of $8.9 billion in 1993, up 39% from $6.4 billion in 1992, the Big Board reports.
Revenues hit a record $73.2 billion, up from $62.8 billion in 1992.
The industry's assets climbed to $941 billion, also a record, from $744 billion.
