Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed its ratings on about $5.6 billion of long-term debt of Atlantic Richfield Co. under review for possible downgrade, reflecting the continuing impact of lower crude-oil prices and Arco's recent disappointments in finding replacement reserves.
Arco, based in Los Angeles, declined to comment on the Moody's action.
The move follows a similar action by McGraw-Hill Inc.'s Standard & Poor's Corp., which placed Arco and 10 other oil companies on its list for possible ratings downgrades.
Moody's said its review will focus on the impact of lower crude prices on Arco's cash flow and financial leverage.
With crude oil accounting for about 70% of Arco's production, "Arco's cash flow and petroleum-production profile are particularly vulnerable to oil-price declines," Moody's noted.
The ratings concern said its review will also take into account the high investments Arco will need to make to hunt for replacement reserves and to meet changing refinery and environmental regulations.
Arco has sustained several major disappointments recently in its exploration attempts in northern Alaska.
Moody's will also consider Arco's recently announced reorganization of its domestic oil and gas operations, for which the company is taking a $450 million charge to earnings.
Under review for potential downgrade are the single-A-1 ratings for long-term debt of the company and its guaranteed subsidiaries.
The Prime-1 ratings for commercial paper issued by Arco, Arco Coal Australia Inc., Kuparuk Transportation Capital Corp. and Arco British Ltd. aren't under review, Moody's said.
