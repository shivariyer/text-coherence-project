Canadian business and consumer confidence rose in the fourth quarter, buoyed by improved economic conditions, the Conference Board of Canada said.
The board's index of business confidence increased 10% from the third quarter to 150.8, its highest level since 1989.
Its consumer confidence index rose 14% to 105.5.
The board, an independent business research group, warned that the increase in consumer confidence may be short-lived if the job market doesn't show significant growth.
The indexes were based on December surveys of 400 Canadian businesses and 1,000 households.
