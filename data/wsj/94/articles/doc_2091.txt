Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest software maker, gave a surprise sneak preview at a software conference here of its first product that will take advantage of "on-line" data services.
In recent months, there has been much speculation about whether -- and how -- Microsoft will take advantage of the burgeoning demand for up-to-the-minute data that is sent to people instantaneously over telephone lines.
Companies that sell on-line data fear that Microsoft could take a big chunk of this business because of its strength in computer programs.
Michael Maples, a senior executive vice president at the Redmond, Wash., Microsoft, demonstrated at a meeting of the Software Publishers Association a computer program that stores historical data on professional baseball teams, players and leagues.
Mr. Maples said the program, which Microsoft could begin selling within 30 days, will have the power to tap into a service that delivers daily baseball scores and statistics for $1.50 a day.
Mr. Maples said that the responsibility for actually supplying "the fresh statistics" is being handled by an outside company, which he didn't name.
On-line services are seen by Microsoft as a way to increase revenue beyond the sale of software.
Rather than launching an on-line network to compete with America On-Line, Prodigy and other full-fledged services, Microsoft's approach of its baseball-information product suggests that it will pursue specific niches instead.
Mr. Maples said the on-line service would also be able to distribute "baseball add-on" products made either by Microsoft or independent suppliers.
People familiar with Microsoft's plans say its "Baseball Daily" service will be followed by other on-line services that tie into Microsoft programs aimed at consumers.
Mr. Maples would not comment on other future products but he said that Microsoft intended to take advantage of a technology trend that makes possible "the integration of software products with on-line services."
