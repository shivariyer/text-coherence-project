Ball Corp. had a loss of $58.7 million, or $2.02 a share, for the fourth quarter, reflecting a $58 million charge for certain restructuring actions.
Separately, the company cut its quarterly dividend to 15 cents a share from 31 cents a share, saying the new rate is consistent with changes in its capitalization as a result of last year's spinoff of Alltrista Corp.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, the maker of metal and glass containers earned $11 million, or 39 cents a share.
Sales rose 6.3% to $557.7 million from $524.8 million.
Ball said the restructuring actions include plant closings and consolidations primarily within its packaging operations.
The charge covers employee severance and relocation costs, write-downs of fixed assets and equipment, costs associated with the elimination of certain product lines, as well as costs associated with the previously announced closing of Ball's Asheville, N.C., glass facility.
The company said the restructuring provision will help improve its overall competitive position in its core packaging and aerospace market by helping to eliminate excess capacity, reduce costs and trim unprofitable product lines.
As a result, the company said it expects to reduce the number of operating locations by 10% and its work force by 8%.
For all of 1993, Ball had a loss of $65.1 million, or $2.38 a share, including a $34.7 million charge for an accounting change and $66 million in restructuring charges.
In 1992, the company earned $67.1 million, or $2.45 a share.
Sales for 1993 were $2.44 billion compared with $2.18 billion.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Ball's shares fell $2, or 7.1%, to $26.
