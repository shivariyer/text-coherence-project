GBC Bancorp, Los Angeles, reached a definitive agreement to acquire First Public Savings Bank F.S.B. in a transaction valued at about $38.3 million.
The purchase price is subject to certain adjustments, GBC said.
The company said it will operate Los Angeles-based First Public as a subsidiary.
GBC said that after recognizing certain costs associated with the merger, shareholders of First Public should get between $9.50 and $10 a share if 1994 earnings projections are attained.
GBC said the purchase, which is subject to approval, is expected to occur this summer.
