K-III Communications Corp. said it acquired the Katharine Gibbs Schools, a chain of career schools, from privately held Phillips Colleges Inc.
Terms of the acquisition weren't disclosed by K-III, a publishing concern funded and partly owned by buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
Katharine Gibbs Schools operates a network of seven "post-secondary" career schools across the Northeast.
The company said it will make the "necessary investments" to strengthen Katharine Gibbs's position as a leading provider of business and office training for men and women.
K-III is buying back a business its top executives once ran under a different owner.
From 1968 to 1989, Katharine Gibbs Schools was owned by Macmillan Inc.
William F. Reilly, chairman and chief executive of K-III, was president of Macmillan in the 1980s.
Founded in 1911, Katharine Gibbs is a top school for executive secretarial training.
It has seven schools located in Boston; New York; Norwalk, Conn.; Piscataway, N.J.; Montclair, N.J.; Melville, N.Y.; and Providence, R.I.
Current enrollment is more than 3,000 students.
