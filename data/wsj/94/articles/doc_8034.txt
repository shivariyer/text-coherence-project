Say police, when there's no one to witness the sight.
They'll pump out the grease by the ton and the pound.
When these outlaws by truck haul their booty away.

Are worth 15 cents per the pound to the buyers.
On the rues of New Orleans in fact, too, they do it.

For the cops staked them out and caught them red-handed.
But their quarry made sure that this time they were hunted.
Insisting that somebody help right this wrong.
