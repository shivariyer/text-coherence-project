Sequoia Systems Inc., in a strong comeback, says it will report fiscal second-quarter net income of $2.4 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $19.6 million, or $2.32 a share, company officials said.
Revenue in the second quarter, ended Jan. 2, will total $11.1 million, up from $11.0 million a year ago, Sequoia officials said in an interview.
"The company has absolutely been turned around from being on death's door to being a very stable, profitable, highly liquid, cash-postive company, and debtfree," said Neil McMullan, president and chief executive officer.
A little over a year ago, the Marlborough, Mass.-based maker of fault-tolerant computers was near-bankrupt and looking for a buyer.
