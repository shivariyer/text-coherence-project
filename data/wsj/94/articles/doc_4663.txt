Koninklijke Ahold NV, a Dutch food retailing group, said it has agreed in principle to buy Red Food Stores Inc. from Promodes of France for an amount it wouldn't disclose.
Ahold said the acquisition of Red Food, a U.S. food store chain with annual sales of about $585 million, would be "a clear plus" for the Dutch company's growing American business.
Ahold said it expects the transaction for Red Food, which operates 55 supermarkets in eastern Tennessee and Georgia, to be concluded by the end of April.
Promodes has owned Red Food since 1980.
