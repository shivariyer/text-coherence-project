National Semiconductor Corp., benefiting from higher prices on its chips and a lower tax rate, said its fiscal third-quarter profit more than doubled to $63.8 million, or 48 cents a share.
For the year-ago quarter ended Feb. 28, the Santa Clara, Calif., integrated circuits concern had net income of $26.9 million, or 19 cents a share.
Sales for the current quarter jumped 11% to $544.7 million from $491.5 million a year ago.
The results "far exceeded expectations," said Wertheim Schroder analyst Stuart Johnson.
He had expected fully diluted earnings of 35 cents, compared with the 45 cents reported.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, National Semiconductor shares closed at $23.25, down 12.5 cents.
