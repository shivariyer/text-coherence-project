BellSouth Corp. of Atlanta said it will join two other companies in launching a $160 million high-speed network to transmit voice, data and video images in North Carolina later this year.
BellSouth said the three-year project, which is scheduled to begin operations in August, will connect users to information from 106 sites in North Carolina.
BellSouth said it will invest $69 million in the project.
Sprint/Carolina Telephone, a unit of Sprint Corp. of Kansas City, Mo., will contribute $60 million, and GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn., will invest $30 million, a North Carolina state spokesman said.
The system will use advanced fiber-optic transmission gear, called synchronous optical network.
A BellSouth spokesman said the system will allow a user to transmit a 33-volume encylopedia set in 4.6 seconds, compared with 13 hours required using technology available last year.
