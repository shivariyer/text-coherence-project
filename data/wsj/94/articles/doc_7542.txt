Motorists who have paid for antilock brakes aren't having any better luck avoiding accidents than those whose cars lack the technology, according to a new study.
The study by the Highway Loss Data Institute, concluded that car companies may be overselling the advantages of antilock brakes.
For instance, many advertisements for the mechanism don't make clear that their primary advantage is on wet and slippery roads, HLDI President Brian O'Neill said in a statement.
The institute's study compared insurance losses for cars with antilock brakes and losses for the same cars without antilock brakes.
"We find no reduction in claim frequencies or average amounts of insurance payments under either collision or property-damage liability coverages," said Kim L. Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the institute.
For example, the HLDI found that overall insurance losses for 1992 Chevrolet Cavaliers equipped with antilock brakes were higher than overall losses for 1991 models without antilock brakes.
The nonprofit insurance group said there's nothing wrong with the brakes themselves, which prevent wheels from locking during emergency braking.
Rather, many motorists don't use the antilock brakes properly, Mr. O'Neill said.
He said antilock brakes should never be pumped as drivers are taught to do during emergency stops with conventional brakes.
Antilock brakes can prevent wheels from locking, reduce stopping distances and improve driver control during emergency braking, especially on wet and slippery pavement.
