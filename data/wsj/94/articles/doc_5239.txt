Hearst Corp. said it acquired a minority interest in Books That Work, a Palo Alto, Calif., company that produces "how-to" software.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Hearst said the companies will develop and market multimedia software tied to appropriate Hearst magazine titles, such as Popular Mechanics and House Beautiful.
A spokesman said that Popular Mechanics might produce a computer disk on "how to build a deck around your pool," which would allow a user to pick a design, calculate how much lumber would be needed, and then get toll-free phone numbers of suppliers.
