Stocks tumbled for a third time in four sessions, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average under 3700 for the first time since December.
A steep sell-off in bonds, after several improved readings on the economy, triggered the stock-market slide.
The selling intensified late yesterday, leaving the Dow industrials with a loss of 63.33, or 1.68%, to 3699.02.
It was the biggest one-day drop since Feb. 4, when the Dow lost 96 points.
The Treasury's 30-year bond lost more than a point, pushing its yield back over the 7% mark, to 7.06%.
Although stocks were weak all day, with the Dow Jones industrials off more than 40 at midday, traders said it was a late burst of selling in the stock-index-futures market that carried market indexes to their closing lows.

Both market segments have been strong in 1994.
