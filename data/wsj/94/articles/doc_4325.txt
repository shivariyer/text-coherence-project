The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it will survey its 220,000 members for their views on whether health-care reform legislation should include a requirement that employers help pay for their workers' medical insurance.
President Clinton's proposed employer mandate has caused a rift in the Chamber between companies that provide insurance, and smaller companies and employers of part-time workers.
The nation's largest business organization has struggled with what to say publicly.
This month, a Chamber official withdrew copies of written testimony endorsing a mandate shortly before it was to be delivered to the House Ways and Means Committee.
Then, the Chamber's health-policy committee endorsed essentially the same approach of phasing in employers' health-care payments to reach 50% of the cost of a "lowest-priced" plan by the year 2000.
The Clinton administration favors requiring employers to pay 80% of the cost of coverage.
Richard Lesher, Chamber president, said it intends to hear all its members' views but meanwhile will "stand by the board's established guidelines for reform, which call for a market-based solution without excessive government costs, regulation and bureaucracy."
The Chamber's board, which meets Monday, will review the survey results "when they become available."
