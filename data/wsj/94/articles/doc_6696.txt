Seagull Energy Corp. said it increased its proven reserves of natural gas, crude oil and condensate significantly since the beginning of last year.
The Houston oil and gas explorer and producer said that it ended 1993 with proven U.S. reserves of 915 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 14.8 million barrels of crude oil, condensate and natural-gas liquids, or a total energy equivalent of one billion cubic feet of natural gas.
A year earlier, the company's proven U.S. reserves totaled 884 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 18.1 million barrels of oil, condensate and natural-gas liquids, or a total of 993 billion cubic feet of naturalgas equivalents.
Last month, Seagull expanded its reserve base to include Canadian gas and oil properties when it acquired Seagull Energy Canada Ltd, formerly Novalta Resources Inc.
