Microsoft Corp., reacting to last week's loss of a patent-infringement lawsuit, is revamping as many as a half dozen software programs that make some use of the company's disputed data-compression technology.
Microsoft executives said the cost of changing the products would have no material affect on the company.
Last week, a Los Angeles jury said Microsoft should pay Stac Electronics $120 million for infringing upon patents that underlie a technique that makes it possible to cut in half the amount of hard-disk space required to store information.
In its latest version of DOS, a personal-computer operating system, Microsoft added a feature called "Double Space" that performed the compression.
In the aftermath of last week's ruling, which Microsoft plans to appeal, the company said it was halting manufacture of DOS with Double Space and cutting the feature from the product.
Now, Microsoft has realized that it must also take similar steps to remove its data-compression feature from a forthcoming version of its Windows NT operating system.
Excel, a spreadsheet, and Power Point, a presentations program, also contain the Double Space technology, a company official said.
