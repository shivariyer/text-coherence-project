The semiconductor industry had a good month in February as strong bookings pushed its key indicator up.
Last month's book-to-bill ratio was 1.15, the Semiconductor Industry Association said.
That's up from 1.10 in January, but down from 1.19 a year earlier.
The ratio means for every $100 of chips shipped in February, chip makers received $115 of orders.
February chip shipments, based on a three-month moving average, rose 33% to $2.34 billion from $1.75 billion a year earlier.
Shipments for February were up 2.5% from $2.28 billion in January.
Orders, also based on a three-month average, rose 28% to $2.67 billion from $2.08 billion a year earlier.
February orders were up 6.4% from $2.51 billion in January.
