International Business Machines Corp. said in New York that it would delay by several weeks the introduction of the Simon "personal communicator," which combines a cellular phone, fax and computer.
IBM said it encountered trouble with Simon's wireless faxing capability.
The device sometimes cuts off fax transmission when the cellular phone signal it uses weakens or is temporarily interrupted, IBM said.
Such split-second interruptions aren't a problem with voice calls.
IBM said it will modify Simon's circuitry to better deal with vagaries in the cellular signal.
IBM originally planned to release Simon by the end of March.
The one-pound device, which resembles a hand-held cellular phone, was designed by IBM but will be assembled by Mitsubishi Corp. and sold by BellSouth Corp.
