Harry's Farmers Market Inc. said it is curtailing store expansion plans in the face of recent losses.
The chain of five food stores said it had planned to open two large farmers' markets and as many as three more specialty convenience stores this fiscal year.
Instead, the Atlanta company will open one large farmers' market during fall, at the earliest, and postpone the other large store, set for Nashville, Tenn., indefinitely.
The specialty store openings also will be delayed, the company said.
The company said it will slow growth plans until it can fix problems it has had with manufacturing and distribution facilities.
The company announced in January that it expects to report a pretax loss of $4.5 million to $5.5 million for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Feb. 2.
