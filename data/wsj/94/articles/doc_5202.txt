Dutch recording and filmed-entertainment company PolyGram NV said it has set up a unit in the Czech and Slovak Republics as part of its planned expansion into Eastern Europe.
The new unit begins operations March 1, London-based PolyGram said.
PolyGram, which is majority-owned by Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands, already has a subsidiary in Budapest.
The subsidiary will be based in Prague and have a branch office in the Slovak capital of Bratislava.
"Eastern Europe represents important growth opportunities for PolyGram," the company said, noting that in the Czech Republic the "level of music piracy is among the lowest of the former Communist countries."
