Your Feb. 4 article "Beef Irradiation Meets Politics in Washington" attempts to make a case for the beneficial uses of this technology in combating the threat of contamination by e.coli bacteria.
Though the goal of eliminating e.coli from beef is laudable, the use of irradiation to accomplish this raises some disturbing issues that should preclude its widespread use.
Irradiating the entire U.S. beef supply would require the construction of large irradiators across the country.
Since these facilities would use radioactive sources that need to be replenished frequently, their operation necessitates the production, transportation and disposal of large quantities of dangerously radioactive materials.
Current supplies of cobalt-60 may be inadequate to provide for hundreds of new irradiators.
According to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there have been 54 accidents at 132 irradiation facilities around the world since 1974, some of which had serious consequences.
With the construction of hundreds of irradiators needed for irradiating all domestic beef, the potential for additional accidents would be greatly increased.
The dangers inherent in this technology make it a poor choice for dealing with food safety problems.
We have better, safer solutions.
