Tidewater Inc. said it will redeem $47.2 million in debentures and consequently take a charge to earnings of $7.7 million, or 14 cents a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31.
The company set April 18 as the redemption date for all of its 7% convertible subordinated debentures due 2010 and said it will pay $1,014 for each $1,000 of principal plus accrued interest.
Until April 18, Tidewater said holders may convert the debentures into Tidewater common stock at a conversion price of $25 a share, or 40 shares for each $1,000 of principal.
Tidewater shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $20.875 in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Tidewater said the fourth-quarter charge assumes none of the debentures will be converted into common stock.
Tidewater, a New Orleans-based owner and operator of a fleet of vessels that serve the oil industry, said this redemption will make the company essentially debt free.
