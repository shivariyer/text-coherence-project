Raytheon Co., citing strong sales of its aircraft products and appliance goods, said fourth-quarter earnings grew 9.1%.
The Lexington, Mass., maker of aircraft missiles, electronic equipment and appliances, had net income of $185.4 million, or $1.37 a share, compared with $170 million, or $1.26 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales climbed 5% to $2.52 billion from $2.39 billion.
Raytheon said aircraft products sales in 1993 rose to $1.47 billion from $1.25 billion in 1992.
Operating profit for that part of Raytheon's business rose to $182 million from $140 million.
The company's electronics sales fell to $4.79 billion in 1993 from $4.98 billion the year before.
Operating profit for the segment rose to $812 million, from $760 million.
The company attributed lower sales to delays in receipt of international government orders.
Energy and environmental sales fell to $1.72 billion, from $1.76 billion.
Operating profit within the group fell to $115 million from $147 million.
Raytheon said sales for the segment were higher, excluding 1992 sales of Seismograph and Geoquest, which were sold in 1992.
The company attributed the higher sales to increased construction activity, but said profits fell because of contract receipt timing and of higher costs on an international project.
Raytheon said its sales in its major appliances segment rose to $1.23 billion from $1.07 billion, while operating profit rose to $48 million from $34 million.
For the full year Raytheon reported earnings increased 9.1% to $693 million, or $5.11 a share, from $635.1 million, or $4.72 a share.
Sales rose slightly to $9.2 billion from $9.06 billion.
