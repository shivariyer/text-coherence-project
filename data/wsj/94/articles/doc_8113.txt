Microelectronics & Computer Technology Corp., an Austin, Texas, research consortium, said it received a $9.8 million federal contract to help develop a national computer network for U.S. manufacturers.
The two-year contract, from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, an arm of the Defense Department, will enable companies to swap on-line information with suppliers and potential customers.
MCC, as the research group is known, will provide software to run the network, including security functions, a directory of services, and a mechanism that will allow companies to set up lines of credit and on-line billing.
The MCC work is the second phase of a government project aimed at developing new technologies to improve U.S. manufacturing.
Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Utah are working as subcontractors to MCC on the effort.
