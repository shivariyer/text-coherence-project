Shawmut National Corp. resubmitted an application to acquire New Dartmouth Bank, according to a Shawmut spokesman.
Shawmut agreed to acquire the closely held Manchester, N.H., bank last March.
But the Federal Reserve Board rejected the application in November, citing concerns about Shawmut's compliance with fair-lending laws.
At the time, the Justice Department was investigating possible evidence that Shawmut Mortgage Co., a unit, may be guilty of lending bias.
Lending discrimination charges, however, were settled with the Justice Department in December, when Shawmut Mortgage agreed to set up a $960,000 fund to compensate blacks and Hispanics who may have been unfairly denied mortgages.
Among its resubmission papers was a full-year report on mortgage loans and rejections by Shawmut, categorized by race, an annual disclosure that banks are required to file.
"We believe that we've satisfied all the Fed's concerns," said Robert Guenther, a Shawmut spokesman.
Mr. Guenther said Shawmut doesn't know when government regulators will reconsider its resubmitted application.
