German conglomerate Metallgesellschaft AG won shareholder approval for key elements of a 3.4 billion mark ($1.97 billion) rescue package to avert bankruptcy.
But the company's supervisory board was unable to put to rest shareholder criticism of its role in the debacle at Germany's 14th-largest industrial concern.
Responding to charges that the supervisory board had inadequately monitored management's activities, Supervisory Board Chairman Ronaldo Schmitz began an extraordinary holders meeting with a lengthy defense of the body's actions.
Mr. Schmitz insisted that the supervisory board had fulfilled its duties as best it could given that it was supplied with information that was "incomplete and untrue" by the management board.
Former Management Board Chairman Heinz Schimmelbuschand and his board colleagues were dismissed in December for failing to inform the supervisory board of business problems, especially speculative oil-trading contracts that produced losses of some 2.3 billion marks.
Mr. Schmitz, who is also a management board member of Deutsche Bank AG, said it was "sheer nonsense" to suggest that the banks and other major shareholders represented on the supervisory board "had known about this game of roulette and promoted it and that with guilty consciences they therefore quickly appointed a new management" once the troubles were exposed.
Although the many outraged small shareholders seemed unconvinced by Mr. Schmitz's defense, it was evident from the outset that shareholder approval of a 1.4 billion mark capital increase and the first of two debt-for-equity swap operations to raise an additional 1.3 billion marks would be granted.
These measures, plus a new 700 million mark credit line from the company's creditors, are the cornerstones of the rescue package.
