Your Feb. 24 editorial "Trivial `Secrets'" criticized the prosecution of Tharman Shanmugaratnam and four others for violating Singapore's Official Secrets Act by divulging official secrets.
Your description of how innocent the leak was, as if these were established facts, shows little of the respect for the judicial process that your paper has always advocated.
The trial is still in progress.
How the leak happened is for the court to decide.
If, as you claim, the prosecution has ulterior motives and the accused are innocent, then the prosecution will fail.
The government is fully aware that "markets depend on information, and more and faster information will allow them to work better."
It releases significant information as quickly as possible, so that "lots of people are competing to evaluate it."
But that does not mean there should be no secrets in Singapore.
No government can function completely in the public view.
Even information that is to be published must be kept secret beforehand, especially if it is market sensitive, so that it can be released properly and simultaneously to all market participants.
The GDP growth figure whose leak led to this trial is a case in point.
The Singapore government will not allow anyone to use the excuse of "aggressive reporting" or the needs of "the information age" to divulge classified information.
The fact that "Singapore is hardly leaking all over the place" is because we plug leaks whenever they occur.
This attitude may strike American journalists as quaint.
Since Watergate and the passage of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, Americans have grown used to frequent leaks of sensitive official information.
American journalists, some officials and even the public regard such leaks as normal.
American society cannot claim that this change has improved American governance.
Singapore is not following that American model.
