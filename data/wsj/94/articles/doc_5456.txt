Same-store sales rose only slightly and profit margins fell, but Zale Corp., Dallas, reported an earnings turnaround in its fiscal third quarter.
The nation's largest jewelry retailer reported net income of $41.6 million, or $1.19 a share, in the Dec. 31 period, its first full quarter since emerging from bankruptcy-court proceedings.
That compared with a year-earlier loss of $17.8 million.
The company said year-earlier per-share figures weren't comparable because its old stock was canceled under the reorganization plan that took effect July 30.
The year-earlier loss resulted largely from restructuring costs of $92.1 million, including $41.7 million to cover the closing of 175 stores in early 1993.
"The reason there was an improvement was because of that charge," Merrill Wertheimer, the company's controller, said.
Same-store sales -- at stores open for at least a year -- rose only 1.6% in the quarter, from a year earlier.
Overall sales declined 7%, to $396.5 million from $428.2 million, primarily because of store closings.
Zale's margins fell to 36.9% from 37.2% a year earlier, Mr. Wertheimer said.
