CBS Sports President Neal Pilson stepped aside Friday, as expected, after more than a decade overseeing the division of CBS Inc.
Mr. Pilson will become a senior vice president at CBS's Broadcast Group as of April 11, working on unspecified new business issues.
CBS hasn't yet named a successor for the unit, which is in the process of being sharply scaled back after losing both Major League Baseball and National Football League rights for the coming season.
One candidate to succeed Mr. Pilson is Joseph Abruzzese, CBS's senior vice president of sales, who is known as a masterful negotiator.
Mr. Abruzzese now reports to Peter Lund, executive vice president of the broadcast group, who last week added the title of president of the CBS Television Network.
Mr. Pilson, 52 years old, headed CBS Sports from 1981 to 1983, and again from 1986, overseeing it in between as well.
In an ill-fated strategy to use major sports events to bring back prime-time viewers, CBS went on a $3.66 billion spending spree in the late 1980s, buying baseball, football and Winter Olympics rights.
When the advertising recession hit, CBS took about $600 million in sports-related losses in 1990 and 1991.
Since then, CBS lost baseball, which moves to Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and General Electric Co.'s NBC this season, in a radical revenue-sharing deal.
In December, CBS lost the National Football League package it had televised for 38 years, when it was outbid by News Corp.'s Fox.
The Olympics rights panned out, however, with the 1994 games setting viewing records.
In another pending change at CBS Sports, Mark Harrington, the vice president in charge of Olympics coverage, is expected to be named to a new post overseeing CBS's entry into new media.
