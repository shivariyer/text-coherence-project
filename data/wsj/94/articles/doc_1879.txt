Hoping to reinvigorate flagging nicotine patch sales, Marion Merrell Dow Inc. launched a marketing program that includes giving smokers personal pep talks by phone to help them quit.
Smokers who enroll in the program, called "Nicoderm Committed Quitter's Personal Support Plan," receive printed material, including a personalized calendar and postcards from Marion Merrell, a Kansas City, Mo.-based unit of Dow Chemical Co.
Twice during the program, they receive phone calls from the program's representatives to check on their progress and get them back on the program if they have faltered.
The program is the latest example of pharmaceutical companies getting directly involved in patient care to boost sales.
Although Nicoderm has 46% of the patch market, its new prescriptions in February were 68,000, down from a peak of 345,000 in March 1992, according to Hemant Shah, an independent analyst.
