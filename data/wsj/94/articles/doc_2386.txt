Auto supplier Perceptron Inc. said it will announce today fourth-quarter earnings ranging between $1.8 million and $1.9 million, compared with net income of $400,000 in the year-earlier quarter.
James A. Ratigan, executive vice president, finance and operations, said that profit was equivalent to per-share earnings ranging between 44 cents and 46 cents, compared with 10 cents in the year-earlier period.
Revenue for the quarter ranged between $6.6 million and $6.7 million, up from $3.9 million a year earlier.
"We had a phenomenal fourth quarter," Mr. Ratigan said in an interview.
"It was a record quarter for bookings, which reached $8.2 million, reflecting the timing of several new car programs."
For all of 1993, Mr. Ratigan said new orders surged 48% to about $21 million, up from $14.1 million a year earlier.
"We are working off an exceptionally strong backlog," said Chairman James E. McGrath.
"We are very optimistic about 1994, and we feel comfortable with analysts' estimates that we'll earn something in the 95 cents range this year."
Perceptron, which makes software and hardware to measure objects in three-dimensional space, plans to announce earnings for all of 1993 of roughly $2.7 million, or as much as 68 cents a share.
Mr. Ratigan said the company had no debts at the end of the year.
"During 1993, the U.S. automotive industry was terrific for us," Mr. McGrath said.
"The international auto markets really had damped economies.
But we've laid a lot of ground work and feel we are well positioned for a rebound in those cycles."
Mr. McGrath said Perceptron is also exploring ways to expand its technology to nonautomotive industries, and is "looking closely at a number of opportunities."
Perceptron is planning to increase its world-wide employment levels to about 125 workers from 101 employees this year, and is planning to boost spending on research and development by about 20% from year-ago levels, Mr. Ratigan said.
