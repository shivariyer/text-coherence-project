Viacom Inc. stock fell 4.6% yesterday following the endorsement by Paramount Communications Inc.'s board of Viacom's takeover bid.
Viacom Class B nonvoting shares fell $1.75 to $36 a share on the American Stock Exchange, cutting the value of Viacom's bid slightly.
Shares of its bidding rival, QVC Network Inc., fell $1 to $43 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, cutting the value of its bid by a comparable amount.
As a result, Viacom's bid dropped to about $9.7 billion, and QVC's to $10.1 billion.
The Paramount board endorsed the Viacom bid Friday, partly because it offers more cash and some protection against a downturn in Viacom's stock after the acquisition of Paramount.
QVC is expected to make a slight increase in its bid sometime before Jan. 31.
Both bidders are supposed to submit their best and final offers by Feb. 1.
