Parallel Petroleum Corp. said it completed its first expanded Yegua Gas Sand discovery well, the Cox & Perkins Catherine No. 1, located in Jackson County, Texas, through its partnership with 3DX Technologies Inc.
Parallel, based in Midland, Texas, said that on a four-point test using choke sizes ranging from 5/64 to 8/64 inch, the well's open-flow potential was calculated to be 10.7 million cubic feet of gas per day, plus associated natural gas liquids at a ratio of 52 barrels per million cubic feet.
Flowing tubing pressures ranged from 6,013 pounds per square inch to 6,568 pounds per square inch.
The company said Cox & Perkins Exploration Inc. is operator of the well and owns a 65% working interest.
3DX Technologies, which managed the 3-D seismic imaging process for the project, owns a 17.5% working interest before payout and a 21.875% working interest thereafter, and Parallel owns a 17.5% working interest before payout and a 13.13% working interest thereafter.
