Armand D'Amato, brother of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, is not in a federal penitentiary.
This fact was misstated in Thursday's Politics & People column on the op-ed page ("Whitewater and the Battle of Stalingrad").
Armand D'Amato has been convicted of mail fraud and sentenced to five months in jail.
He is free on bond pending appeal.
