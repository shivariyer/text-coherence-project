Boeing Co. reported a 15% drop in fourth-quarter net income, a smaller decline than most securities analysts had expected.
Still, some analysts lowered their estimates for Boeing's 1994 earnings because the company plans to spend more on new-airplane development.
The Seattle aerospace concern said it earned $304 million, or 89 cents a share, down from $357 million, or $1.05 a share, a year earlier.
Sales for the quarter fell 25% to $5.66 billion from $7.50 billion.
For all 1993, earnings dropped 20% to $1.24 billion, or $3.66 a share, from $1.55 billion, or $4.57 a share.
Sales slid 16% to $25.44 billion from $30.18 billion.
The company also projected that 1994 sales will fall even more sharply, by at least 17.5%, to between $20 billion and $21 billion.
Boeing shares closed at $44.50, down 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Tough times in the airline industry have hurt Boeing's orders for new commercial airplanes and forced sharp production-rate cuts and heavy layoffs.
Despite the cutbacks, the company seems to be holding the line on costs and generally maintaining profit margins.
Analysts were encouraged by those signals, and surprised by the fourth-quarter earnings that were about six cents a share higher than their concensus estimate.
The performance was attributed to lower-than-expected outlays for research and development for new models of variations of airliners.
However, a belief that Boeing will return to higher levels of development spending this year prompted some analysts to reduce their 1994 earnings projections.
Boeing is likely to spend $1.75 billion this year on three planes, an advanced 350-seat 777 airliner, a more efficient small twin-jet called the 737-700, and a freighter variant of its widebody 767 plane, according to Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities in New York.
"There is no shortage of things to spend money on," Mr. Demisch said.
He lowered his 1994 earnings estimate to $2.10 a share from $2.40 a share.
He also reduced his 1995 estimate to $2.15 a share from $2.20.
But analysts also said they were encouraged by the strength of Boeing's commercial airliner profit margins, which despite the production cuts declined only to 8% of revenue in 1993 from 8.2% of revenue in 1992.
And they are optimistic that Boeing's investment now will pay off when the airliner market bounces back.
Boeing said the 1993 earnings decline was mainly due to heavy development expenses and to reduced commercial aircraft sales.
Boeing delivered 330 commercial jet transports last year compared with 441 for 1992.
Those factors were partly offset by increased revenue from customer financing, which has risen rapidly as airlines have needed more help paying for aircraft.
Customer-financing commitments at Boeing totaled $3.2 billion in the fourth-quarter, down from $3.5 billion in the third-quarter but still far higher than last year's amounts.
Boeing officials have told analysts that financing totals will rise in 1994, before dropping back by the end of the year to 1993 year-end levels.
While some analysts were disappointed with profit margins at Boeing's defense and space unit, Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz said in the company's earnings report that the 1993 improvement "reflected both strong program performance and excellent cost management."
