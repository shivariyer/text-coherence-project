Pentech International Inc. is poised to report sharply higher results, thanks to a strategy of pitching its writing instruments beyond the peak back-to-school season.
David Melnick, president, expects to report this week that earnings and sales for the fiscal first quarter, usually a slow period, rose more than 50%.
The quarter ended Dec. 31.
A year earlier, Pentech, which makes designer pens, pencils and markers, had net income of $427,000, or four cents a share, on sales of $6.4 million.
"The big thrust has been to present Pentech as a company you can buy products from all year round," Mr. Melnick said in an interview.
The biggest months for the company traditionally are late spring and early summer, when retailers begin stocking their shelves with supplies for students returning to school.
But beginning last year, Pentech began merchandising products with holiday designs to increase its off-peak business.
For example, Pentech sells pencils during Halloween as an alternative to candy for trick-or-treaters.
This year Pentech is broadening the program.
It is also branching into new businesses that have less of a seasonal swing, such as its new Color Club product line designed to appeal to the children's activity market.
And come this spring, Pentech will more aggressively enter the cosmetic pencil business.
Making the cosmetic pencils is "a nice diversification, but we are using a lot of skills we learned in the pencil factory," Mr. Melnick said.
He added that the same channels the company uses for its writing instruments can be used to sell the cosmetic pencils.
Pentech, which already makes about 40% of its products in a two-year-old New Jersey plant called Sawdust Pencil Co., is outfitting a separate facility nearby to produce cosmetic pencils.
That plant is expected to be fully operational in the next few months.
The balance of its products are imported.
