Swiss drug giant Ciba-Geigy AG is the latest to challenge the U.S. patent protection of Glaxo Holdings PLC's flagship anti-ulcer drug Zantac, one of the world's biggest-selling drugs.
Ciba-Geigy looms as a far more formidable adversary than small Canadian and German generic companies that have attempted to launch copycat versions of Zantac.
But U.S. courts recently upheld Zantac's patents and analysts said there's scant evidence so far to suggest the Swiss assault will fare better.
Indeed, Glaxo itself disclosed that Ciba-Geigy's U.S. unit Geneva Pharmaceuticals Inc. had filed a so-called abbreviated new-drug application for a generic version of Zantac with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Such a filing is the usual route to approval for a generic product -- allowing the applicant to dispense with most of the expensive, time-consuming clinical trials required for clearance of a new drug.
The procedure also requires the generic applicant to pledge that it won't market its product prior to expiration of the original drug's patent.
In this case, that's the so-called form one patent on ranitidine hydrochloride, Zantac's active ingredient, which expires in the U.S. in December 1995.
In a statement, Glaxo said it is considering all possible courses of action, including legal proceedings against Geneva Pharmaceuticals.
