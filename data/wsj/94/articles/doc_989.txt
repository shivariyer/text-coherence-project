The Justice Department said it intends to file suit to block the acquisition by Flow International Corp. of Ingersoll-Rand Co.'s Waterjet Cutting Systems Division.
The department's antitrust division said the companies are the two dominant manufacturers in the $34 million-a-year waterjet cutting-equipment industry.
Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general heading the antitrust division, said the merger would create a company that controlled almost 90% of all waterjet-pump sales in the U.S.
Flow is based in Kent, Wash.
Ingersoll is based in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
