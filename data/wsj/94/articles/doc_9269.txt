Europe's weak economy and low oil prices will continue to depress profit at Belgian oil and gas group Petrofina SA in 1994, analysts said.
However, there could be a marked increase in 1995 once investments in upgrading its Antwerp refinery start to yield wider profit margins, they added.
A Petrofina spokeswoman declined to comment on profit expectations for 1993 and 1994 ahead of the announcement of results in early February, other than to say that "of course 1993 was difficult."
She said, however, that once the Antwerp investment is completed and costefficiency measures implemented, Petrofina believes it will in 1995 "be better prepared to benefit from all opportunities."
Analysts mostly forecast that 1993 profit will decline by around 20% from 352 Belgian francs ($9.76) a share in 1992.
However, one pointed out that net profit would be bolstered by one-time gains from the sales of North Sea oil fields and a stake in energy holding company Tractebel SA.
While forecasting a slight upturn in 1994 profit, most analysts said their forecasts were likely a bit "optimistic."
Petrofina posted a profit of 4.6 billion francs ($127.6 million) in 1992, down 72% from a year earlier.
Recurring profit fell 50% to 7.9 billion francs.
