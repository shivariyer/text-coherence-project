Porsche AG, the maker of pricey German sports cars whose products became a symbol of '80s excess, is trying to retune itself for the frugal '90s.
"A Porsche represents the ultimate deferable purchase," Frederick J. Schwab, the president of Porsche of North America Inc., acknowledged at the Chicago Auto Show.
"Our goal is to make it OK to drive a Porsche again."
Porsche needs to do something.
Sales last year shrank to just 19,000 cars worldwide, including 4,000 in the U.S.
That's a mere shadow of Porsche's former self.
Sales of its muscular sports cars peaked at 55,000 units world-wide in 1986, including 30,000 in the U.S.
Mr. Schwab outlined a strategy intended to boost sales 15% this year and to push world-wide volumes to 30,000 annually by 1997.
The strategy includes catching up with the rest of the industry in adopting lean production techniques, cutting prices and introducing an "entry-level" model.
A new ad campaign in the U.S. pokes fun at Porsche's tendency for taking itself too seriously.
But the strategy doesn't include selling out to a larger auto maker, as most other small independent companies already have.
"I personally don't think Porsche can keep its uniqueness and character as part of a larger group," Mr. Schwab said.
"And the family can afford to stay independent."
Nonetheless, the closely held Stuttgart concern is expected to launch a public stock offering this spring of more than 440,000 shares, Mr. Schwab said.
Half of the shares are to be purchased by the controlling Porsche family (of whom Ferdinand Piech, the chairman of Volkswagen AG is a scion).
After shedding hundreds of employees and suppliers world-wide and adopting lean production techniques, Porsche managed its first profit in years during the fiscal year ended July 1993.
Mr. Schwab said Porsche hopes its new pricing strategy will help boost sales.
When redesigned 911 coupes and cabriolets debut this March in the U.S., both will be priced about $5,000 lower than their comparably equipped predecessors ($59,900 for the coupe, $68,200 for the cabriolet).
In 1997, Porsche is to introduce a coupe based on a popular auto-show concept car, the Boxer, priced under $39,950, lowering the hurdle for entry-level Porsche buyers.
Together with its $80,000-plus 928 models, this will give Porsche a model lineup in 1997 that should boost U.S. sales to about 10,000 cars a year, Mr. Schwab said.
