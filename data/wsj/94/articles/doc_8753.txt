Arkla Inc. said in Houston that it will record a still-to-be-determined fourth-quarter charge to scale back its relationship with a Tulsa, Okla., investment company, but Arkla said it would still record a profit for 1993.
For the first nine months of the year, Arkla earned $40.7 million, or 28 cents a share.
The natural gas transportation, distribution and marketing company said it has terminated most of its ties with subsidiaries of Samson Investment Co.
Transactions between Arkla and Samson originated in 1991.
