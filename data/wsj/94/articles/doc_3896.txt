Maclean Hunter Ltd. said an Ontario court has dismissed a request by Rogers Communications Inc. for access to confidential data about Maclean Hunter's cable-television operations.
As reported, Rogers is offering to acquire all the shares of Maclean Hunter, a Toronto-based cable television, printing and publishing concern, in a bid valued at 2.79 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.07 billion).
Rogers, a Toronto-based telecommunications concern, had sought a court order forcing Maclean Hunter to include it in any auction of the latter's Canadian cable-television assets and give it access to data rooms set up for interested bidders for other Maclean-Hunter operations.
Maclean Hunter asked Rogers to sign a confidentiality agreement before giving it access to the data.
But Rogers objected to a clause requiring it to agree to a standstill period of 90 days or more as a condition of gaining access.
Rogers's C$17-a-share offer is set to expire March 15.
A spokeswoman for Rogers said the company is "disappointed" by the decision, but that at this time it doesn't plan to appeal the ruling.
She said Rogers will continue to seek access to the data on a basis which doesn't interfere with its bid.
"The reality is that Rogers executives have most of this information already," says Robert Furse, chief financial officer of Maclean Hunter, noting that Rogers has obtained extensive data filed with Canadian communications regulators with respect to the Canadian cable-television assets.
Mr. Furse said Maclean Hunter will continue to offer Rogers access to other data on the same basis as other interested parties.
