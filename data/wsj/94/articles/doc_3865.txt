Procter & Gamble Co., Cincinnati, said it offered 9.7 million pesos ($9.8 million) for the 14% stake of Argentine cleaning products company Compania Quimica SA that it doesn't already own.
The consumer products giant said in a statement that its Procter & Gamble Interamericas Inc. unit is willing to pay 10.214 pesos a share for the 949,251 outstanding Class A and B shares in Compania Quimica.
Compania Quimica produces three liquid dish detergent brands in Argentina, including the top two.
As previously reported, P&G in late December acquired 73% of the company from Bunge & Born SA, a holding company based in Buenos Aires, for 52.5 million pesos, and purchased an additional 13% of the company from Newcas International SA and Clara SA for 9.3 million pesos.
