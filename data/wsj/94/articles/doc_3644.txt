Selling cars in downtown San Antonio may not make much economic sense.
But fixing them?
That's something else.
Ford Motor Co. has joined forces with seven suburban Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealers to open a downtown Ford repair shop.
Ford says the shop, the first to be operated by a group of dealers as partners, may serve as a model for similar centers nationwide.
The dealers will continue to offer repair work on their own premises.
But the shop will provide an option to Ford drivers who work or live downtown, where there hasn't been a Ford dealer since the last one moved to the suburbs last summer.
For the dealers, the new shop has two purposes.
First, recapture lost service dollars.
David Caplan, a Ford spokesman, says that in recent years, competition from low-priced tune-up, brake-repair and maintenance shops across the country has captured more than two-thirds of nonwarranty service work.
"We'll be as competitive as anyone in our pricing," says Bob Crow, president of the Northside Ford dealership, and the managing partner of the Ford & Lincoln-Mercury Auto Care Center, as the shop is called.
The ultimate goal, though, is more basic: sell more Fords.
"If we make Ford owners feel they'll be taken care of properly for the life of the vehicle," says Mr. Caplan, "they'll be more inclined to purchase another Ford."
