Volkswagen AG, as expected, ousted the chairman of its Audi AG division.
The German auto maker said FranzJosef Kortuem would be succeeded by Herbert Demel, effective immediately.
However, the title of chairman at Audi is being done away with, and the 40-year-old Mr. Demel will have the lesser title of board spokesman, indicating an attempt to bring the power center closer to VW headquarters, industry observers said.
Mr. Demel had been chief for technical development.
VW gave no official explanation for the management change, but said it was a "mutually agreed upon" decision.
But people close to VW, who had leaked word earlier this week that Mr. Kortuem would get the ax, said it reflected VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech's displeasure with the losses Audi experienced under the 43-year-old Mr. Kortuem's leadership last year.
Mr. Kortuem couldn't be reached for comment.
Audi is expected to post a pretax loss of around 300 million marks ($172 million) for 1993, compared with a 508 million mark pretax profit in 1992.
