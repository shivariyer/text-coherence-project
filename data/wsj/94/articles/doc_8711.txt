Facing stiff foreign competition, Japan Airlines said it will cut 5,000 jobs, nearly one-quarter of its work force, and sharply trim capital investment over the next four years.
JAL said its cutbacks should save 100 billion yen ($901.3 million) in the next fiscal year, which begins April 1.
JAL, formerly Japan's flag carrier, said it expects to report a pretax loss of $270.4 million for the year ending March 31.
The airline has been struggling in recent years due to the world-wide economic slowdown, the rising yen and high operating costs.
It had a loss of $485 million in the previous fiscal year.
JAL aims to break even in the coming two fiscal years and attain stable profitability from the year that begins April 1, 1996.
The job cuts, representing about 23% of JAL's work force of 22,000 people, will be implemented through attrition, curbs on new hiring and transfers to related companies, JAL said.
The airline also said it will trim capital investment for 1994-1997 by about 48% to $3.96 billion from a planned $7.57 billion.
Some 747-400s and other aircraft will be introduced later than initially planned, and the carrier said it is considering introducing smaller planes.
