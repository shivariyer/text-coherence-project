U.K. industrial holding company Hanson PLC said Monday that its 100% flotation of its Beazer home-building unit will occur in March.
Hanson said Victor Benjamin, deputy chairman of U.K. groups Tesco PLC and Lex Service PLC, will become Beazer's chairman.
Dennis Webb, now head of the Beazer unit, will be chief executive.
In December, Hanson estimated it would float Beazer sometime in the first half of 1994.
The market expects Hanson to receive in the neighborhood of #450 million ($663 million) for Beazer.
The home builder had #37.5 million of operating profit for the year ended Sept. 30, 1993.
The earnings are a swing from a #61.7 million loss in the year ended June 30, 1992.
The company recently changed its reporting year to end Sept. 30.
In the July-September 1992 quarter, Beazer earned 7.5 million.
