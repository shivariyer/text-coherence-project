President Clinton chose a telecommunications lawyer, Raymond G. Romero, to be assistant transportation secretary for aviation and international affairs.
Mr. Romero, 40 years old, is vice president and general counsel for the international arm of Ameritech, a Chicago-based regional telephone company.
He has no aviation experience, but a Transportation Department spokeswoman said he has had extensive experience with international negotiations.
Mr. Romero's primary responsibility will be overseeing aviation agreements with other countries.
Airlines have criticized the Clinton administration for failing to fill the post sooner.
The U.S. has been involved in sensitive landing-rights negotiations with Great Britain, Germany and other countries.
The administration had trouble finding a candidate who hadn't worked for one of the airlines -- and thus would be disqualified from working on many issues.
