Safeco Corp. said it expects claims to the company from last month's earthquake in Los Angeles to top $50 million, triggering its catastrophe-reinsurance coverage.
Safeco, of Seattle, said that under its reinsurance program it will be reimbursed for 90% of the losses between $50 million and $200 million.
To date, the fire and casualty insurance concern said it has handled about 5,500 earthquake-related claims.
