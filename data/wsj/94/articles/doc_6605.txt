Insurance companies are expected to pay $725 million in claims arising from damage caused by last month's frigid weather in the Eastern U.S.
The Property Claims Service division of the American Insurance Services Group, the official scorekeeper of insurance claims, said collapsed roofs, busted pipes, downed gutters and power blackouts triggered claims in 20 states.
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania suffered the most severe damage.
Pennsylvania alone had $65 million in damages.
The storms hit Jan. 14 through Jan. 20.
The claims service is currently preparing an estimate on the Los Angeles earthquake of Jan. 17.
Unofficial estimates put the claims at more than $2 billion.
