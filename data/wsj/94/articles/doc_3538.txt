Alcan Aluminium Ltd. said it hired CS First Boston Corp. to explore options for selling Alcan's building-products divisions in the U.S. and Canada.
The divisions had combined sales of about $425 million last year and employ 1,800 people.
They produce aluminum, vinyl and steel goods such as siding and windows.
The Montreal aluminum maker said the decision fits with its strategic plan to focus on its smelting and rolling operations, while trimming investment in "downstream" fabricating businesses.
