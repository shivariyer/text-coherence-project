California Federal Bank reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter as projected, results that analysts said improve the odds that the thrift will be sold.
The loss of $53.7 million, or $2.22 a share, compares with a loss of $45 million, or $5.40 a share, a year ago when adjusted for a 1-for-5 reverse stock split last year.
For 1993, the Los Angeles thrift had a loss of $145.5 million, or $5.98 a share, compared with a loss of $97.3 million, or $16.40 a share.
Countering the trend at most California financial institutions, CalFed's loan-loss charges more than doubled to $46.2 million from $20.8 million in the year-ago period.
CalFed President and Chief Executive Edward Harshfield, who joined the thrift in September, is pursuing a "hold and fix" strategy.
Recently, a purchase offer by Golden West Financial Corp., Oakland, Calif., was spurned.
But some large shareholders say they may bring pressure on the board to consider selling the company.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, CalFed closed at $13.875, down 62.5 cents.
