Standard & Poor's Corp. said it will remove Ethyl Corp. from its S&P 500-Stock Index after the close of trading Thursday.
Ethyl is spinning off its chemical business into a new company called Albermarle Corp.
S&P said Ethyl is being removed from the index because the spinoff will significantly reduce its size.
Unum Corp., a Portland, Maine, insurance company, will replace Ethyl.
