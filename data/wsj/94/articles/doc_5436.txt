FMC Corp. said it has agreed to acquire the automated-vehicle-systems group of Caterpillar Industrial Inc., a Mentor, Ohio, automated guided-vehicle-systems supplier.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The Chicago machinery and chemicals concern said most of Caterpillar Industrial's business relates to self-guided vehicles that move unit loads between work centers or warehouses.
Caterpillar Industrial is a unit of Caterpillar Inc., Peoria, Ill.
FMC said the automated-vehicle group will operate as a unit of its energy and transportation equipment group's material handling systems division.
The company said completion of the deal is subject to approval of a definitive agreement by both companies and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter 1994.
