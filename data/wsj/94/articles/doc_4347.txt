Chieftain International Inc. adopted a shareholder-rights plan similar to plans recently adopted by a number of other Canadian oil and gas companies.
Chieftain, an Edmonton, Alberta, oil and gas producer owned 22% by Alberta Energy Co., Calgary, Alberta, said that under the plan, an acquisition offer must be for all the company's voting shares and must be made to all its shareholders.
In addition, at least 50% of shares not held by the bidder must be deposited for the bidder to buy any shares under the bid, shareholders must be given at least 90 days to consider the offer, and the bidder mustn't own more than 10% of Chieftain's shares while the offer is open.
Chieftain said the plan includes certain exceptions for its current major shareholder.
The proposal is subject to regulatory approval and will be submitted for ratification at Chieftain's annual meeting May 26.
