In response to your March 3 editorial "Before Brady": In criticizing the Brady Law, you related the story of a Marine corporal who used a handgun to protect herself from an ex-lover who attacked her with a bayonet.
This perpetuates misinformation.
The Brady Law includes a clause that waives the five-day wait for an individual who believes his/her life is in danger.
The horrifying details of the corporal's story clearly indicate the need for a waiver; the story would have had the same ending, post-Brady.
The Brady Law will prevent gun crimes and violence.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reports that in the first days of the law's implementation, nearly 10% of the attempted handgun purchases were by prohibited people -- including convicted felons -- and were denied.
Already, the law has proven successful at keeping guns out of the hands of criminals.
You question the Brady Bill just because you can cite an instance where the five-day waiting period would have precluded a woman from buying a handgun that saved her life.
Do you also question the value of seat belts, inasmuch as there are rare instances where they have trapped an accident victim, resulting in greater injury or even death?
Clearly, laws passed for the greater good of society will occasionally produce a result opposite to that intended.
