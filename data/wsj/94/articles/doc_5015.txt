International Business Machines Corp. reorganized the management of its European personal-computer business, in an effort to cut costs and increase efficiency.
The management changes, which took effect a few weeks ago but weren't announced publicly, eliminated four jobs at the top of IBM's European PC unit -- the biggest PC maker in Europe with annual revenue estimated to exceed $2.5 billion.
Some of the executives involved moved to jobs elsewhere with IBM.
The net effect, said Howard Ford, the PC unit's marketing manager, was to cut out two layers of management in the European PC business.
The PC unit's top supervisor, William McCracken, 51 years old, remains president of PC operations for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia/Pacific region.
But his deputy in Europe, General Manager Giuseppe Giuliani, 45, was named to a senior job in IBM's Italian subsidiary, running the marketing and computer-services division for all products except PCs.
Mr. McCracken will do both his own job and Mr. Giuliani's old job.
Meanwhile, three of Mr. Giuliani's lieutenants were reassigned and their old posts eliminated.
The three -- Mr. Ford, Irwin Staudt and Jean-Claude Malraison -- were regional marketing managers for northern, eastern and southern Europe, respectively.
Mr. Ford was named to a new post of PC marketing manager for all of Europe, reporting to Mr. McCracken.
Mr. Staudt moved to IBM-Germany to run marketing for non-PC products and services.
Mr. Malraison was named head of IBM's European computer-workstation business.
Market-research concern Dataquest Inc. estimates IBM's share of the European PC market slipped to 14.7% in the fourth quarter, compared with 15.5% a year earlier.
Dataquest estimates that, overall in 1993, IBM gained 0.9 percentage points of European PC market share, to 13.3%.
