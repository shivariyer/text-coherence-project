Shares of Japanese video-game maker Sega Enterprises Ltd. sank 2.9% on Friday, following its announcement that it expects earnings to plunge in the current fiscal year.
Sega officials said consolidated pretax profit is expected to drop 62%, to 22 billion yen ($212 million) for the year ending March 31 from 59.18 billion yen the year earlier.
The company also estimates an 8% decline in group sales, to 385 billion yen from 416.23 billion yen.
In Tokyo trading, Sega shares Friday closed at 7,280 yen, down from 7,500 yen.
The stock continued its decline Monday, but not as sharply as in the previous session, falling to 7,220.
Sega blamed the revision on economic sluggishness in Europe and on the strong yen, which makes exports from Japan more expensive overseas and lowers the yen-denominated value of overseas sales.
A company spokesman said Sega expects a recovery next year, thanks to plans to launch a line of toys aimed at younger children and to open the first of its virtual reality-based theme parks in Japan.
