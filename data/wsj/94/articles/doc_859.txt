Swiss food concern Nestle SA said its group net profit grew 7% to 2.89 billion Swiss francs ($2.02 billion) last year from 2.70 billion francs in 1992.
The result was in line with expectations.
Consumer caution in Europe and an unusually high restructuring charge of 611 million Swiss francs damped last year's earnings, but analysts forecast stronger profit growth in 1994.
The company, whose brands include Libby's and Buitoni, said sales rose 5.5%, to 57.49 billion francs.
Hurt by the recession in Europe, where Nestle generates almost half of its business, volume sales increased by only 1.7%.
"In view of the economic circumstances, maintaining volume growth at this rate is nevertheless considered satisfactory and was largely attributable to the strong development of the group's business in Asia and Latin America," the company said.
