A group of current and former Zilog Inc. workers sued the company for $7.7 million in U.S. District Court in Boise, Idaho, this week, alleging that Zilog exposed them to toxic chemicals at a wafer fabrication plant in Nampa, Idaho.
The suit charges that at least 200 workers were exposed to toxic compounds that made them ill.
The suit also claims that Zilog discriminated against employees who were allegedly disabled following exposure to the chemicals.
A Zilog spokeswoman said the integrated-circuits company denies the allegations.
"We believe our factory is safe for employees and that the company procedures comply with the best industry practice," she said.
