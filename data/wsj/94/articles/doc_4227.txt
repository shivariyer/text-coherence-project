Levi Strauss Associates Inc. said net income for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Nov. 28 rose 5% to $141.1 million.
In the year-earlier period, the closely held San Francisco-based maker of blue jeans and other clothes had net income of $134.3 million.
Sales for the quarter edged up 2% to $1.59 billion from $1.56 billion.
For the year, net income jumped 36% to $492.4 million from $360.8 million.
Sales rose 6% to $5.89 billion from $5.57 billion.
Levi Strauss said its profit jumped despite the modest sales gains because of strong pricing.
It said, however, its fiscal 1994 net income would be significantly lower than in fiscal 1993, primarily because of an expected $400 million pretax charge related to an accounting change and expected lower sales because of a weak global economy.
