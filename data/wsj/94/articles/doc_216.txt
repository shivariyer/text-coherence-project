Rank Organisation PLC said it expects to take an exceptional provision of $75 million on its first-half results for the closure of a U.S. video and audio rack business.
The British leisure group said that the pretax provision relates to its Rank Retail Service America unit, based in Pittsburgh, and will include $10 million of goodwill that has already been written off.
Rank said that the rack business has been unprofitable for the past four years, losing $22 million in the year ended Oct. 31, 1993.
Rank's decision to close down its video distribution unit wasn't unexpected.
The company recently said that it would try to fix the unit by requiring stores to buy movies at cost, paying Rank a transaction fee, thus eliminating the financial burden and uncertainty of returns.
