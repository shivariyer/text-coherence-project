Selective Insurance Group Inc. said it expects property losses from winter storms to range from $8.5 million to $9.5 million after reinsurance.
In addition, the Branchville, N.J., insurance holding company said it expects underwriting losses in the first quarter from state-mandated involuntary workers' compensation and commercial automobile pools will be about $3 million lower than a year ago, while labor costs will be about $1 million lower due to work force cuts.
Taken together, the company said the items will reduce first-quarter net income by a range of $2.9 million, or 21 cents a share, to $3.6 million, or 26 cents a share.
In the year-earlier first quarter, Selective Insurance had net of $3.3 million, or 24 cents a share.
