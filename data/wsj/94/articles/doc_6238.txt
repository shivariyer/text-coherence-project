International Business Machines Corp.'s IBM PC Co. unit cut prices as much as 19% on the most recent models of its increasingly popular ValuePoint desktops for commercial customers in response to competitors and Intel Corp.'s recent reductions on the Pentium chip.
ValuePoint's two Pentium models are still only a fraction of total shipments of IBM PCs, but Intel has cut prices 14% on the Pentium chip in order to increase demand and make its high-performance chip more price competitive.
The IBM Pentium desktops will sell now for $4,149 compared with $4,700, and $4,199, down from $5,180.
In response to Compaq Computer Corp. cuts on similar models, IBM PC also lowered prices on all entry-level ValuePoints by 13%, starting at $749.
It also reduced by 10% prices for the Multimedia series, which will now start at $1,422.
Stuart Cohen, director of commercial desktops, said some of the ValuePoint models will be "refreshed" this spring, but IBM hasn't yet decided which ones.
