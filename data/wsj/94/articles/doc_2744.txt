Star Banc Corp. said its directors approved a stock-repurchase plan calling for the buyback of as many as one million common shares over the next three years.
The bank holding company said it expects that the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
The shares Star Banc buys back will be held as treasury shares for reissue in connection with potential conversions of the company's Series B preferred stock, the stock option plan or for other general corporate purposes, the company said.
Star Banc, with about $7.6 billion in total assets, currently has about 29,756,000 common shares outstanding.
