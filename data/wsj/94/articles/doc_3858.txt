Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., said it began shipping its Macintosh Quadra 610 DOS Compatible personal computer, which enables users to switch from a Macintosh operating system to DOS and Windows-compatible software in a couple of keystrokes.
Introduced at a trade show in the fall of 1993, the Quadra 610 DOS Compatible PC is priced at $1,579 in a version equipped with eight megabytes of random access memory, and 160 megabytes of data storage in the hard drive.
The price is roughly 17% to 20% more than Apple's Quadra 610 PC, which currently retails for about $1,300 to $1,350.
Apple said users of its older Quadra 610 and Centris 610 computers can upgrade their machines with a DOS-compatible card costing $399.
