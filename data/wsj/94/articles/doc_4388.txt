Discount retailer Caldor Corp. said that fiscal fourth-quarter net income fell 6% mainly due to a charge for retirement of debt.
For the quarter ended Jan. 29, net income was $34.1 million, or $2.03 a share, including a charge of $3.8 million, or 23 cents a share, for the debt retirement.
A year earlier, the Norwalk, Conn., company had fourth-quarter profit of $36.3 million, or $2.45 a share.
Sales for the period rose 14% to $858.5 million from $750.5 million.
Heavy fourth-quarter promotions and a tough economy contributed to earnings for the year that were lower than the company's goals, Chief Executive Don R. Clarke said.
He said the company plans to continue its growth program and open 14 to 17 stores.
For the full year, net declined 3.8% to $33.2 million, or $2.01 a share, after charges of $5.4 million for the debt retirement and $2.8 million for accounting changes.
The retailer typically earns the bulk of its profits in the fourth quarter.
A year earlier, Caldor had net of $34.5 million, or $2.35 a share, after a $2.8 million charge for accounting changes.
Sales for the year rose 13% to $2.41 billion from $2.13 billion.
