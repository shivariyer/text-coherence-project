Germany and Japan have agreed to provide Iran with $4.6 billion in credits to pay for about half of Tehran's debt outstanding, Iran's Central Bank governor said.
Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Mohammad Hossein Adeli as saying that a representative of the bank signed a $2 billion deal in Tokyo Saturday, and that a similar agreement for $2.6 billion was signed with Germany about two weeks ago.
The credits, to be used for payment of delayed Iranian letters of credit held by Japanese and German businesses, will erase more than 50% of Iran's foreign debts, the radio quoted Mr. Adeli as saying in an interview.
