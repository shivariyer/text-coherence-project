Foodmaker Inc. said it agreed to pay $1.3 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the parents of a Tacoma, Wash., two-year-old who died last year after eating a tainted hamburger at a Jack in the Box restaurant.
The boy, Michael James Nole, was the first to die in the outbreak of E. coli bacteria.
More than 400 people, mostly in Washington state, became ill after eating tainted Jack in the Box burgers.
"The company has stated from the beginning of this outbreak that we were committed to doing what is right," Foodmaker spokeswoman Sheree Zizzi said.
Foodmaker has reached settlements in cases involving three other victims who died in the outbreak, though it hasn't disclosed the amounts.
The settlements are covered under a $100 million comprehensive insurance policy that Foodmaker has with Chubb Corp., Ms. Zizzi said.
Still outstanding are some 20 lawsuits filed by individuals who got sick in the outbreak, as well as a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of about 470 victims and their family members.
In an arrangement that settles part of the class-action lawsuit, Foodmaker in November said it would create a monitoring program and a trust fund to pay certain costs.
