Continental Airlines and Air France have postponed implementing a marketing agreement whose aim is to boost traffic for both in the competitive trans-Atlantic market.
The delay in the agreement, which was signed last July, stems from Air France's change in management late last year.
In a news release, Air France said its new management needs more time to assess its operations as well as relationships with other carriers.
The agreement didn't involve any exchange of equity or "code sharing," where airlines both give their own flight number to the same flight and jointly market it.
It would, however, involve coordinating the two carriers' schedules, linking their frequent-flier programs and sharing space at terminals in Paris and Newark, N.J.
