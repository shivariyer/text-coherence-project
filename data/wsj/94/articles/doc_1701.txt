Houston-based Landmark Graphics Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Advance Geophysical Corp. of Denver and said it expects to take a $2 million charge for acquisition costs in its third quarter ending March 31.
A year earlier, net income was $1.9 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $23.6 million.
Landmark, which announced the acquisition in January, said the indicated value of the transaction is now more than $70 million, because of an increase in Landmark's common-stock price.
The company agreed to acquire Advance Geophysical for 2.6 million Landmark common shares.
Both companies are involved in the use of computer systems for oil and gas exploration.
