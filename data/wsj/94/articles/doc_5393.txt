National Media Corp. said it will launch a televised home-shopping business in Japan through an agreement with the Japanese trading company Mitsui & Co.
The nation's leading infomercial marketer, based in Philadelphia, said it will provide infomercial programming for a trial this spring, while Mitsui will arrange for broadcasting and marketing.
The project could be expanded to other Asian countries and Australia, National Media said.
The announcement comes as ValueVision International Inc., a Minneapolis home-shopping network, has launched a $10.50-a-share tender offer for National Media shares.
National Media hasn't made a recommendation on the offer.
A National Media spokesman said the Mitsui announcement is unrelated to the tender offer but added that "anything you do that makes your business stronger is a positive thing."
