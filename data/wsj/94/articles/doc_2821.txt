Cambior Inc. said it won a bid to acquire the La Granja copper-mining project from the Peruvian government.
Under terms of its bid, Cambior, a Montreal based gold-mining concern, said it has the option to acquire a 100% interest in the project by investing $25 million on exploration and development over five years, of which $6.6 million would be spent in the first year.
Minero Peru SA, a government-owned company, would retain a 5% royalty interest in the deposit.
Assuming the exploration program is successful, Cambior said it expects to complete an economic feasibility study on the project within 36 months.
Cambior said the acquisition, which should be completed in about six weeks, reflects the company's strategy of diversifying into base-metal mining.
Cambior said it would use the La Granja acquisition as a "springboard for participating in other gold and copper projects in Peru."
