McDonald's Corp., citing steady growth and rapid expansion of its world-wide business, reported that annual net earnings exceeded $1 billion for the first time.
The fast-food chain said fourth-quarter earnings rose 16% to $264.5 million, or 72 cents a share, from $227.9 million, or 61 cents, a year ago.
In the latest period there were 10.7 million, or 2.9%, fewer shares outstanding.
For the full year, net income rose 13% to $1.08 billion, or $2.91 a share, from $958.6 million, or $2.60 a share.
Revenue for the quarter, which include sales at company-owned restaurants and franchise revenue, rose 6% to $1.93 billion from $1.83 billion.
System-wide sales, which include those at franchised stores, grew 8% to $6.15 billion from $5.71 billion.
For the full year, revenue totaled $7.4 billion, up 4% from $7.13 billion, while system-wide sales reached $23.5 billion, an 8% increase from $21.8 billion in 1992.
Overseas operations contributed nearly 40% of system-wide sales last year, although Japan, McDonald's biggest overseas market, continued to be hampered by a weak economy.
Total operating profit outside the U.S. rose 9% during all of 1993 and 10% in the latest quarter, reflecting what the company said was expansion and higher operating margins partly offset by weaker foreign currencies.
During 1993, McDonald's added 900 restaurants world-wide -- 576 outside the U.S. and 225 more than during the previous year.
The company has nearly 14,000 restaurants in all.
