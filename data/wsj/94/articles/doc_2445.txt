Program trading in the week ended March 4 accounted for 10.7%, or an average 32.7 million daily shares, of New York Stock Exchange volume.
Brokerage firms executed an additional 20.3 million daily shares of program trading away from the Big Board, mostly on foreign markets.
Program trading is the simultaneous purchase or sale of at least 15 different stocks with a total value of $1 million or more.
Of the program total on the Big Board, 44.5% involved stock-index arbitrage, down from 45.3% the prior week.
In this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
Some 57.2% of program trading was executed by firms' for their own accounts, or principal trading, while 32.2% was for their customers.
An additional 10.6% was designated as customer facilitation, where firms use principal positions to facilitate customer trades.
Of the five most-active firms, Nomura Securities, Susquehanna and Kidder Peabody executed all or most of their program trading for their own accounts, while Morgan Stanley and First Boston did most of their program trading for their customers.
