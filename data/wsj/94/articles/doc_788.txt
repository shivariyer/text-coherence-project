In a sign of the art market's recovery, the two major art-auction houses announced they will offer several million-dollar paintings at their annual spring art sales.
These auctions, held in the first two weeks of May, normally set the tone for the broader art market.
The artworks that Sotheby's Holdings Inc. and Christie's International PLC will sell are of higher quality than those put on the auction block in recent years, officials of the companies said.
They also carry higher presale price estimates; several paintings are expected to bring more than $3 million each.
The auctions, which begin May 3, will feature a Jasper Johns abstract painting "Highway," estimated to sell for about $8 million at Sotheby's, and paintings from the estates of Hollywood agent Irving "Swifty" Lazar and venture capitalist Neil A. McConnell.
Mr. McConnell's estate, which will be offered at Christie's, is valued at about $13 million and includes paintings by Claude Monet and Pierre Auguste-Renoir.
Mr. Lazar's estate, to be sold at Sotheby's, is valued at $2 million and includes work of Paul Delvaux.
Following the collapse of the art market in fall 1990, it was uncommon for collectors or their heirs to consign major works to the auction block.
But strong art sales in 1993 led more collectors to test the market for major works.
