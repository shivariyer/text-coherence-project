The government's traffic-safety agency has upgraded an investigation into reports that the rear hatch of Chrysler Corp. minivans popped open during accidents that killed eight people.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in its monthly defect-investigation report, said it had received reports of 13 accidents involving nine injuries and eight fatalities in the 1984-94 Voyager, Caravan and Town and Country.
The rear lift-gate latching mechanism released on impact, the agency said.
About four million of the minivans are on the road.
The government said Chrysler earlier replaced 4,184 latches for binding and sticking problems.
"We do not believe there is any problem with the latch mechanism," said Chrysler spokesman Tom Kowaleski.
"Our minivans have had an exemplary safety record."
During a preliminary evaluation, the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork.
The probe then could be upgraded to the engineering-analysis stage, as the Chrysler minivan case has been, during which engineers study the parts to see if they are defective.
