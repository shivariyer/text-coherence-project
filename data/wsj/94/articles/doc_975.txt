Faced with a judge preparing to sentence him for racketeering and stock fraud, the founder of the defunct Crazy Eddie electronics chain turned over foreign bank accounts containing $52 million sought by the government.
Eddie Antar signed over the money to a court-appointed trustee.
Sentencing of Mr. Antar and brother Mitchell was adjourned to April 15 to allow the trustee time to get the money.
Eddie and Mitchell Antar were convicted in July of pocketing nearly $80 million by selling Crazy Eddie stock boosted artificially in value through inventory inflation and other schemes.
The money in the foreign accounts would be turned over to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which obtained a $73 million judgment against Mr. Antar for restitution to Crazy Eddie investors.
The judgment totals about $90 million with interest.
In the separate, criminal case, the government has been seeking a 25-year term for Eddie Antar.
