A former chief financial officer for Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of mail fraud for participating in a kickback scheme.
Assistant U.S. attorney Deirdre Daly said David W. Granston admitted receiving about $100,000 in kickbacks from three brokers in exchange for Consumers Union purchasing goods and services from them.
She said Mr. Granston faces a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a fine of $250,000.
He will be sentenced on April 22, she said.
Mr. Granston, 56 years old, was indicted late last year on one count of conspiracy and 12 counts of mail fraud.
Ms. Daly said that under an agreement with the government the other counts will be dismissed at the time of sentencing, but that Mr. Granston's punishment "will reflect the full amount of the $100,000" he received in kickbacks.
Mr. Granston, who now lives in North East Harbor, Maine, was chief financial officer at Consumers Union from 1983 until his dismissal in April 1991.
He couldn't be reached for comment.
