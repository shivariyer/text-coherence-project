Bethlehem, the nation's second-largest steelmaker, said it expects strong demand to continue this year, resulting in a profit for 1994.
Bethlehem reported a fourth-quarter loss of $242.6 million, or $2.78 a share, compared with a loss of $56 million, or 69 cents a share, in 1992's fourth quarter.
The most recent period's loss included a $290 million restructuring charge for a revised modernization plan at its structural-products division and an idled coke plant.
Sales climbed 14% to $1.13 billion from $990 million.
Bethlehem's operating profit of about 40 cents a share topped analysts' estimates in the mid-20 cents range.
J. Clarence Morrison, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said the company's earnings benefited from a favorable product mix and cost-cutting, along with stronger demand and higher prices.
He estimated Bethlehem's profit per ton at $28, much better than the $20 he expected.
"We expect to see continued improvement in demand in 1994 from major steel markets such as automotive, construction and machinery," said Curtis H. Barnette, chairman and chief executive.
"A continued economic and steel-market recovery coupled with only a modest rise in steel imports should result in 1994 domestic-industry shipments which match or exceed 1993's estimated 87 million tons, and we expect that Bethlehem will be profitable for the year 1994."
For the year, including the restructuring charge, Bethlehem reported a loss of $266 million, compared with a loss of $550 million for 1992.
Net sales for 1993 were $4.32 billion, compared with $4 billion in 1992.
Bethlehem is scaling back its plans to modernize its structural-steel business.
Under the original plan, the company planned to install a continuous caster at its structural-steel operation and reduce employment by 1,500.
Bethlehem said it has decided to ship steel from another unit to make the structural products, eliminating the need for the caster.
Although the revised project will cost less -- about a quarter to one-third of the original $100 million estimate -- the company is reducing another 500 jobs at that plant, resulting in the need for additional charges.
Bethlehem said it scaled back its modernization program after deciding to limit its presence in the structural-steel business.
The company said it will now focus on light and medium wide-flange beams, which are used mainly in lighter, low-rise buildings.
The heavy wide-flange beams are used in high-rise buildings, which the company noted are being hurt by reduced commercial construction activity and low occupancy rates.
National Steel, citing "operational problems," reported a fourth-quarter loss of $138.8 million, or $3.89 a share, reflecting unusual charges.
The charges included $108.6 million to recognize liabilities from the temporary idling of an iron-ore plant and $13.6 million for inventory adjustments.
The charges were offset, in part, by a $14.2 million deferred income-tax credit.
The company also reported a $16.5 million charge for accounting changes which was applied retroactively to the first quarter.
For the year-ago fourth quarter, National Steel had a loss of $99 million, or $4.06 a share, including charges of $25.2 million, largely for health and pension benefits for United Mineworkers retirees.
Sales for the quarter were $585.4 million, compared with $572.8 million last year.
The company said it expects a first-quarter gain of more than $110 million stemming from a favorable U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case involving USX Corp.'s former Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad unit.
For 1993, National reported a loss of $258.9 million, or $8.04 a share, including $111 million in charges for the idled plant and accounting changes.
Last year, the company posted a loss of $48.4 million, or $2.58 a share, including charges of $37 million for the United Mineworkers benefits and accounting changes.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Bethlehem Steel closed at $23.25, up $1.625.
National Steel shares rose 37.5 cents to $15.75.
