Paxar Corp. said it expects to report lower fourth-quarter sales and profit because of weakness in the apparel industry, its main customer.
Paxar, a Pearl River, N.Y., company that makes identification systems and products including bar-coding and in-plant labeling systems, said fourth-quarter net income is expected to be about $1.8 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net of $2.4 million, or 17 cents a share.
Sales are expected to be $33.5 million, compared with the year earlier's $34.4 million.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Paxar stock rose 37.5 cents, or 2.7%, to close at $14.125.
