American Real Estate Partners, a real estate partnership, said it would not make a cash distribution in the fourth quarter ended March 31 due to cash demands and required debt payments.
The company had declared a distribution of 12.5 cents per depository unit in each of the prior four quarters.
American Real Estate Partners said it expects net operating cash flow to be slightly above break even for 1994, due to about $20 million in certain payments coming due during the year.
