California state insurance regulators said that 92% of Executive Life Insurance Co.'s 337,357 policyholders chose to participate in a court-approved rehabilition plan for the company under Aurora National Life Assurance Co.
Aurora, established to assume responsibility for Executive Life's policies and annuity contracts, is two-thirds owned by a group headed by Mutuelle Assurance Artisanale de France and one-third by SunAmerica Inc.
State regulators seized Executive Life, a unit of First Executive Corp., in 1991, and engineered a bailout plan that was completed in September.
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi called the result, "a tremendous vote of confidence in our rehabilitation plan, and also in Aurora."
