Sellers swamped the stock market for the fifth straight day, taking the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its lowest level since early November.
The broad-based declines came as interest rates rose again and the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond climbed to 7.10% from 7.06% on Tuesday.
Battered by a wave of computer-guided sell programs, the Dow industrials tumbled 72.27 points to 3626.75, its lowest close since Nov. 4.
It was the biggest one-day slide in the Dow since Feb. 4 when the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, sparking a 96-point drop in the Dow.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock dropped 6.93 to 445.55, and the Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 10.38 to 744.91, its lowest level since Sept. 21.
Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was extremely hectic with about 390,050,000 shares changing hands yesterday, up from 301,140,000 shares the previous day.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers, 2,041 to 357.
Yesterday's sharp sell-off capped a wild day in the stock market.
Stock prices plunged in the first hour of trading, triggering the New York Stock Exchange's 50-point "uptick" rule.
That rule slows computer-guided program trading whenever the industrial average moves up or down 50 points from the previous day's close.
Though the stock market recovered most of its lost ground by noon, a series of sell programs hit the Dow in the afternoon, wiping 38 points from the industrial average, according to Birinyi Associates, a financial-consulting firm.
The selling snowballed, prompting the Big Board to activate its 50-point-uptick rule again.
It was only the second time ever that the exchange has activated the uptick rule twice in one day.
"Right now people have looked at the glass and it's no longer half full, it's completely empty," said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads Birinyi Associates.
"But this has happened before and I expect it will pass."
Mr. Birinyi said what he finds particularly disconcerting is the ferocity of yesterday's program selling.
"I am more disturbed by the intensity of these program trades because it is creating this illusion that there is a lot more weakness than there really is," said Mr. Birinyi.
Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co., said he expects the rise in yields to trigger more stock market selling over the near term.
"My guess is that portfolio managers, especially mutual fund portfolio managers, are going to want to hold more cash," he said.
Many observers have feared that many mutual-fund investors -- especially neophytes who have poured money into the market over the past year -- would bail out if stocks fell into a correction.
Mr. Clough doesn't necessarily expect an exodus, but he said fund managers likely will do some more "pre-emptive selling" to create a cushion against redemptions.
Mr. Clough continues to recommend that investors hold 60% stocks, 25% bonds and 15% cash.
He doesn't expect to join the parade of strategists who have pared their stock allocations this week.
But he said he might recommend a cash-to-bonds switch soon if the long bond yield continues to approach 7.25%.
Some technology stocks managed to snap back some from their recent drubbing.
Microsoft added 1 1/8 to 83 5/8, Lotus Development gained 1/4 to 70 1/4, and 3Com rose 1/8 to 54 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Compaq Computer, meanwhile, increased 2 1/2 to 98 1/4 and International Business Machines rose 7/8 to 53 1/2.
But economically sensitive issues continued to tumble.
Caterpillar dropped 1 3/8 to 109 1/2, General Motors lost 1 3/4 to 54 1/4 and United Technologies skidded 2 3/8 to 62 1/2.
Cyclicals have been among the strongest stocks all year and have been targeted for profit-taking, traders said.
Utilities stocks were also battered.
The Dow Jones Utilities Average lost 3.23, or 1.61%, to 198.00, its lowest level since July 1991.
That is particularly troubling to many people who view that average as a leading indicator for the overall market.
Acclaim Entertainment lost 5 3/8 to 13 3/4 on Nasdaq after WMS Industries didn't renew a contract with the company.
As reported, WMS and Nintendo of America have formed a joint venture to market 64-bit video games exclusively for Nintendo's Project Reality home system.
Acclaim had been marketing WMS's games for home use for the past five years.
Shares of Giant Food plunged 9.4%, or 2 3/8, to 22 7/8 on the American Stock Exchange.
The operator of retail supermarket chains late yesterday said fourth-quarter net income was 61 cents a share, compared with 62 cents in the year-earlier period and below analysts' estimates.
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index tumbled 8.89 to 445.54 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index declined 3.96 to 247.34.
American President plummeted 20.3%, or 6 1/8, to 24 after the company said it expects about break-even earnings from operations in the first quarter, excluding about $10 million of earnings from collection of Desert Storm detention charges and real estate sales to be recognized in the quarter.
A few stocks were helped by positive recommendations from analysts.
Shares of HealthCare Compare jumped 1 1/8 to 20 3/8 after Kidder Peabody raised its rating on the stock to "strong buy" from "outperform."
Kidder maintained its 1994 earnings estimate of $1.30 a share and said it expects HealthCare to exceed the brokerage firm's 1995 projection of $1.50.
The Downers Grove, Ill., company earned $1.08 last year.
Lakehead Pipe Line jumped 9.4%, or 2 1/2, to 29 on the heels of a Smith Barney Shearson upgrade to "outperform" from "neutral."
Shares of A.O. Smith relinquished 10.7%, or 3 3/4, to 31 3/8 despite its estimate that 1994 first-quarter earnings will be 71 cents to 76 cents a share, up from last year's record of 64 cents.
Morrison Restaurants gained 1, or 4.4%, to 23 1/2 after posting third-quarter net income of 33 cents a share, compared with 28 cents in the year-earlier period.
The company also said cash dividends are expected to grow at 5% annually.
Stocks rallied toward break-even territory several times in the session, but selling pressure intensified each time the Dow Jones Industrial Average approached 3700.
The final rebound failed as bond prices turned sharply lower, said Michael Birch, an index arbitrage trader at Kidder Peabody & Co.
Dudley Eppel, senior vice president and head of equity trading at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, said selling by very short-term players, known as day traders, played a large role in the late slide.
Some had bought stocks earlier in the day, betting that the market would recover.
When prices began to retreat instead, they bailed out of positions.
