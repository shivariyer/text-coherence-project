CIT Group Holdings Inc. said fourth-quarter net income rose 5.7% on growth in assets.
The asset-based lender said net in the quarter rose to $44.7 million, from $42.3 million a year earlier.
CIT said the quarter included a charge of $2.8 million related to start-up costs of a second mortgage consumer lending business.
Without those costs, earnings would have risen 9.5%, an official said.
For the year, net rose 12% to $182.3 million from $162.3 million.
The company, which is 60%-owned by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. of Japan and 40%-owned by Chemical Banking Corp., said asset growth for the year was strong.
