McDermott International Inc. said a unit will receive about $80 million of a $112 million contract awarded by an Egyptian utility.
McDermott said Babcock & Wilcox Co., the energy services company's major operating unit, leads the consortium that will build a boiler island for the Egyptian Electric Authority's new power station south of Cairo.
An Italian construction company, Nuova Cimimontubi, is also a member of the consortium.
