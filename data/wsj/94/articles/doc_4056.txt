COCA-COLA BEVERAGES Ltd., Toronto, said it completed an issue of 50 million Canadian dollars (US$37.1 million) of subordinated debt, maturing in March 2000, with Coca-Cola Financial Corp., a unit of Coca-Cola Co., Atlanta.
The debt carries a weighted average interest rate of 10.14%.
Coca-Cola Beverages, 49% owned by Coca-Cola Co., said in November it would seek the financing as part of a corporate restructuring.
