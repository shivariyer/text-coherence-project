U.S. Shoe Corp. said comparable-store sales for the four weeks ended last Saturday fell 8.3%.
Comparable-store sales are those for stores open at least a year.
The Cincinnati company said the poor weather conditions in the eastern half of the U.S., as well as the recent California earthquake, hurt sales results for the company's women's-apparel, optical and footwear retailing businesses.
Total sales for the three retailing groups last month were $122.1 million, compared with $137.4 million in January 1993, U.S. Shoe said.
This represents an 11.2% decrease.
U.S. Shoe said that in the year ended last Saturday, comparable-store sales increased 0.5%.
Total retail sales for the year were $2.16 billion, a 0.9% drop from the same period a year earlier.
