DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. said it has formed a generic-drug unit, Endo Laboratories L.L.C.
The company, a joint venture between DuPont Co. and Merck & Co., is the latest example of branded pharmaceutical drug companies paying more attention to generic drugs.
The unit will develop new generic drug products and acquire the marketing rights of certain generic products currently sold by DuPont Merck.
