Moody's Investors Service Inc., warning of continuing deterioration in parts of the East Coast trash-disposal business, said it is considering lowering its ratings on a combined $377.8 million of bonds issued by New Jersey municipalities.
The bonds were sold to finance trash-disposal facilities in five New Jersey counties and are secured by the flow of fees paid to dump waste.
Moody's said that New Jersey dumping fees are already the highest in the nation, averaging about $100 a ton, and thus can't easily be raised, limiting counties' financial flexibility.
The waste authorities in the counties -- Atlantic, Camden, Mercer, Passaic and Warren -- are "particularly vulnerable" to a potential Supreme Court ruling that could strip away from local governments the power to control where garbage is dumped.
The ruling is expected soon.
In nearby Pennsylvania, Moody's said, disposal prices are $40 a ton and lower at some dumps and incinerators.
If municipalities lost control of where trash is dumped, prices along the East Coast could plunge, undermining public investments in dumps and incinerators.
New Jersey, with nearly $2 billion in publicly financed trash infrastructure, is the most vulnerable state.
Marie Pisecki, a Moody's vice president, said bonds subject to downgrade are those solely secured by revenue from dumping fees; other waste-authority bonds issued by some of the same counties have additional credit backing.
The amounts that could be affected: $87.75 million of Atlantic County Utilities Authority; $189.5 million of Camden County Utilities Authority; $39.9 million of Mercer County Utilities Authority; $34.9 million of Passaic County Utilities Authority; and $25.7 million of Warren County Utilities Authority.
