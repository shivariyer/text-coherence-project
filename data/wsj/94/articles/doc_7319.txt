One Valley Bancorp of West Virginia Inc. said it completed its acquisition Friday of Mountaineer Bankshares of West Virginia Inc. for stock valued at $119 million.
Under the terms of the pact, One Valley exchanged 1.5 shares of common stock for each share of Mountaineer's common outstanding in a tax-free exchange.
The merger is accounted for as a pooling of interests.
The $119 million value is based on the current market price of One Valley common stock, the company said.
One Valley is a bank holding company with $2.8 billion in assets, and Mountaineer has total assets of $739 million and 23 full-service banking offices.
