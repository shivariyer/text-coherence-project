Standard & Poor's Corp. said it placed $42 billion of debt of four Japanese banking companies on its CreditWatch list for a possible downgrade.
Under review are short-term and long-term ratings of Bank of Tokyo Ltd., Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd., and Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
All four are rated double-A for short-term debt and single-A1-plus for long-term debt.
The review also includes debt of Union Bank, San Francisco, majority-owned by Bank of Tokyo; Bank of California, which is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Bank; and Sanwa Business Credit, which is a subsidiary of Sanwa Bank.
S&P said the review reflects its belief that both the magnitude and future expected write-off amounts of problem loans have increased as the economic recession continues in Japan.
S&P said it will evaluate each of the banks' problem loan situations in light of their earnings capacity, level of hidden reserves, and potential restructuring efforts within the next few weeks.
