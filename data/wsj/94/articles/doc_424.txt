The European Union Commission gave Greece one week to suspend its embargo against the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia or face action before the European Court of Justice.
The ultimatum was delivered by Hans van den Broek, the EU's foreign affairs commissioner, in talks with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias.
After the meeting, Mr. van den Broek said the commission could decide to refer Greece to the court as early as next week.
Under EU rules, member states can't decide on their own to close one of the union's external borders, although an exception can be made in cases where national security is threatened.
Greece has cited national security as a basis for its Feb. 16 decision to close its northern port of Salonika to trade with Macedonia.
Only food and medicine were exempted from the move.
The Greek action is aimed at obtaining concessions in a dispute with the former Yugoslav republic over its name, constitution and flag.
Athens argues that use of the name Macedonia implies territorial ambitions against the northern Greek province of Macedonia.
