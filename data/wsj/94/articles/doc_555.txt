Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it upgraded its ratings on $2.7 billion of Kroger's long-term debt, in part because of the grocery-store chain's "strong and geographically diversified customer franchise."
The rating agency also cited Kroger's "improving debt-coverage ratios and the company's business-development strategy, which should translate into substantially higher earnings and cash flow."
Moody's raised Kroger's senior secured notes to Ba-1 from Ba-2; lease certificates, senior unsecured notes, medium-term note program and industrial revenue bonds to Ba-2 from Ba-3; senior subordinated notes, general-term notes and reset notes to Ba-3 from B-1; junior subordinated debentures to B-2 from B-3; and shelf registration to Ba-2/Ba-3/B-1 from Ba-3/B-1/B-2.
USG Corp. (Chicago) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. raised its rating on about $1.2 billion in long-term debt of this building material concern.
The rating agency cited favorable conditions for the gypsum-wallboard industry, as well as USG's recent refinancing that improved its financial flexibility and debt-protection measurements.
Moody's boosted USG's senior secured notes that have operating company guarantees to single-B-1 from single-B-2.
It also raised the company's other senior notes, senior sinking fund debentures, and industrial revenue bonds to single-B-2 from single-B-3.
Senior sinking fund debentures, medium-term notes and industrial revenue bonds issued by USG's U.S. Gypsum Co unit were raised to single-B-1 from single-B-2.
Standard & Poor's Corp. similarly raised its ratings on USG's debt recently.
