French construction group Spie Batignolles, a unit of Schneider SA, said it won a contract for the construction of a new portion of a terminal at the Charles de Gaulle-Roissy airport, north of Paris.
The contract is valued at 400 million francs ($68.9 million), with an unspecified amount considered firm and the remainder to be confirmed at a later date.
The company said its SCGPM and Spie-Citra units will be involved in the project.
