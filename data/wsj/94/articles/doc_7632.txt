Nynex Corp., New York, said it will install public phones in New York that accept prepaid telephone cards instead of coins.
The regional phone company signed an agreement with a unit of Japan's Mitsui & Co. to acquire 5,000 coinless phones by 1996.
Nynex said it will install 1,000 such phones in downtown Manhattan this year, starting in June.
The telephone card is inserted into a slot on the phone, and the cash amount available is read by a scanner.
Customers will be able to buy the cards, in $5, $10 and $20 denominations, from vending machines, newsstands and other locations.
