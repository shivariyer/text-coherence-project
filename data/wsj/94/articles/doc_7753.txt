Schlumberger Ltd., citing the cost of trimming its seismic operations, said fourth-quarter net income fell 20%.
The oilfield-services and measurement-systems concern said earnings for the period were $124 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with $154.1 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 7%, to $1.75 billion from $1.63 billion.
Schlumberger stock rose yesterday to $58.375 a share, up 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The New York-based company said the current weakness in the price of oil "has cast a mood of uncertainty over the upstream spending of our customers."
For the year, Schlumberger's net fell 49%, to $334.8 million, including a $248 million charge related to retirement benefits, from a year-earlier $661.6 million.
Revenue increased 5.9%, to $6.71 billion from $6.33 billion.
