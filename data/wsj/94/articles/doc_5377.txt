David Wachtel Jr., 51 years old, resigned as chairman of O'Charley's Inc., a restaurant chain, to turn full time to his job as president and chief executive of privately held Western Sizzlin' Corp., a chain of steak restaurants.
Mr. Wachtel was one of a group of Western Sizzlin' franchisees who bought the chain, now based in Nashville, out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings last fall.
He will be succeeded by Gregory Burns, 38, and Charles McWhorter Jr., 39, who will be co-chairmen.
Mr. Burns, who had been chief financial officer and president, will assume the chief executive post.
Mr. McWhorter, chief operating officer, will succeed Mr. Burns as president.
Mr. Wachtel, who had been chief executive officer and president, gave up operational responsibility for the company last May, Mr. Burns said.
Since then, the company hasn't had a chief executive officer.
Mr. Wachtel said he is filing a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell as many as 230,000 shares in O'Charley's, about one third of his stake.
He is selling for "personal financial reasons."
The company has about 4.2 million shares outstanding.
