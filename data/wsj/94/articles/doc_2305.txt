Alcan Aluminium Ltd. said it agreed in principle to sell two of its seven aluminum-extrusion facilities in the U.S. and Canada and is negotiating to sell the rest of the business.
The two plants would be sold to closely held Cressona Aluminum Co. of Cressona, Pa., Alcan said.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The plants, in Elizabethton, Tenn., and Franklin, N.H., together have more than 300 employees and represent more than half of Montreal-based Alcan's 82,500 metric tons of extrusion capacity in North America.
A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds.
An Alcan spokesman said the company was discussing with other undisclosed parties the sale of the rest of its extrusion facilities in North America.
The business, which provides materials largely for the building and construction industries, had sales last year of $120 million.
Alcan said the proposed sale reflects its strategy to focus on its main raw-material, smelting and rolling operations.
