Thomas Florio, recently named president and publisher of the New Yorker, has named a second in command, relinquishing the job of publisher to Lawrence C. Burstein and giving him the additional title of senior vice president.
Mr. Burstein, 41 years old, has been publisher of Self magazine, part of the Conde Nast magazine group.
The New Yorker is owned by the Newhouse family's Advance Publications Inc., as is Self, but isn't part of Conde Nast.
Prior to joining Self, Mr. Burstein was publisher of Elle magazine, and his previous experience included a stint as associate publisher of New York magazine.
The move to the New Yorker gives that magazine someone with weekly experience who is also at ease in the Advance Publications' corporate culture.
Succeeding Mr. Burstein as publisher of Self is Beth Fuchs Brenner, 36 years old, who has been advertising director of Self.
