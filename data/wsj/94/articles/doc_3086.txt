Congress's General Accounting Office lined up with the Federal Reserve Board in its battle with the Treasury over banking regulation.
Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, who heads the GAO, told the Senate Banking Committee he agreed with the Fed's concerns that its ability to conduct monetary policy and administer the payment system would be impaired under a Treasury proposal to consolidate the regulatory functions of the four federal banking agencies into one office.
"Because benefit from consolidation should not come at the cost of risking damage to the financial system or from limiting the independence of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve concerns warrant serious consideration," Mr. Bowsher said.
Thursday, committee members made it clear that the Treasury didn't have the votes to pass its plan without changes.
Now Mr. Bowsher's testimony puts added pressure on the Treasury to reach a compromise with the Fed.
