Doskocil Cos., an Oklahoma City maker of pizza toppings and other meat products, moves into frozen appetizers and burritos with an agreement to buy an International Multifoods Corp. unit for about $135 million.
The frozen-food unit being acquired from Minneapolis-based International Multifoods also makes Italian pasta dishes.
It had revenue of about $185 million in 1993.
Robert S. Wright, the International Multifoods executive who runs the operation, will continue to do so at Doskocil.
For Doskocil, the acquisition is consistent with its new emphasis on processed foods, which offer attractive profit margins.
Since emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings in 1991, the company has retrenched by closing hog-processing plants.
Separately, Doskocil said it is still searching for a successor to John T. Hanes, the company's chairman, chief executive and president, who announced his retirement in October.
