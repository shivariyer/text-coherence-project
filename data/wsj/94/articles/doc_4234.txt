Crystal Brands Inc., operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy code protection since Jan. 21, said it entered into a $75 million debtor-in-possession financing agreement with Citicorp's Citibank unit.
The new agreement replaces the Southport, Conn., company's interim DIP facility with Citibank, which had an aggregate limit of $50 million.
Crystal Brands produces sportswear under the brand names Gant, Salty Dog and Izod as well as costume jewelry under the brand names Monet, Trifari and Marvella.
