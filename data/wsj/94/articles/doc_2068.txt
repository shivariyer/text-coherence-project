Commercial-bank earnings jumped to $11.12 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a record for the quarter, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported.
The fourth-period earnings were buoyed by improvements in the performance of banks' "core" loan business, the FDIC said.
They were the second highest for any quarter in banking history, topped only by profits of $11.45 billion in the 1993 third quarter.
Net income of the nation's 10,957 commercial banks was a record $43.43 billion for all of 1993, or 36% higher than the previous record earnings of $32 billion in 1992.
Fourth-quarter earnings climbed sharply from $7.76 billion a year earlier.
The industry's return on assets for 1993 was 1.21%, the first time since the FDIC was created in 1933 that banks had a return of more than 1% for a full year.
Their return on assets in the fourth quarter was also 1.21%, down from 1.27% in the third quarter but topping a 0.89% return in the 1992 fourth quarter.
The FDIC attributed the record earnings to an improved economy, favorable interest rates for banks and banks' efforts to bolster their financial condition.
Total loans and leases outstanding at year end rose 5.8% from a year ago to $2.1 trillion.
Growth in consumer and residential-mortgage loans mainly fueled the increase, and loans outstanding to businesses rose 0.5% after a three-year decline.
The FDIC said the nation's 2,264 savings banks and savings-and-loan institutions earned $1.81 billion in the fourth quarter, up 19% from $1.52 billion a year earlier.
In all of 1993, the thrifts had record profits of $7 billion, a 4.2% rise from $6.72 billion in 1992.
