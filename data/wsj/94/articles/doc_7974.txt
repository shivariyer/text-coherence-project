Times Mirror Co.'s flagship Los Angeles Times said it joined Gannett Co.'s San Bernardino Sun and the Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif., to offer combined sales of advertising in all three newspapers.
The Hays family owns 60% of the Press-Enterprise and Dow Jones & Co. holds 21%.
The Los Angeles ADI Network, as the packaged offering is being called, won't offer much reduction from combined rates in the three papers but is intended as a sales device to compete for national advertising across the Los Angeles region, officials at the Los Angeles Times said.
The officials added that the packaged offering, which will be available for either display or classified advertising, will offer substantial savings over television advertising.
They said the three newspapers combined reach about 33% of the adults in the vast Los Angeles region and about 48% of adults on Sundays.
