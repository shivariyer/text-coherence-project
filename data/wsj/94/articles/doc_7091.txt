RJR Nabisco Holdings Inc. posted a fourth-quarter loss of $461 million, or 35 cents a share, largely reflecting a previously announced charge related to work-force cuts.
But the New York company said that the job cuts will position the company to embark on an "aggressive earnings growth track," starting in 1994.
RJR's large fourth-quarter loss compares with a profit of $45 million, or four cents a share, for the year-earlier quarter.
Sales fell slightly to $4.05 billion from $4.09 billion.
The fourth-quarter loss also included a $32 million charge to pay for the early retirement of debt, and Charles M. Harper, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company planned to retire additional debt this year.
In a prepared statement, Mr. Harper said, "We are cautiously optimistic about domestic tobacco and believe a return to solid earnings growth in 1994 is achievable in that sector."
Analysts said that was Mr. Harper's most positive comment yet on the U.S. tobacco business, which has been battered by a price war.
"He is getting a bit more bullish on domestic tobacco," said Ronald Morrow, a tobacco analyst with Smith Barney & Upham Inc.
In interviews last year, Mr. Harper said he didn't see U.S. tobacco as a long-term growth business.
Recently, cigarette companies have raised prices moderately, and additional such increases are expected.
For the fourth quarter, RJR said its Nabisco food business's operating profit increased 16%.
RJR's stock closed yesterday at $7.375 a share, down 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
