Foreign investment in Venezuela, excluding oil, petrochemicals, coal, insurance and banking, rose to $2.5 million in January, the Superintendency of Foreign Investment said.
The figure is up from $2.07 million in January 1992 but still only a fraction of the figure of $121.6 million in January 1991.
Investment from the U.S. accounted for 81% of the total while investment from Colombia accounted for 10%.
About 80% of investment was in finances and services and 13.4% was in manufacturing.
After surging strongly in 1990 and 1991, foreign investment in Venezuela trailed off, following the first of two coup attempts on Feb. 4, 1992.
