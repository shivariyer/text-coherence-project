A Japanese government official, under fire from industry and broadcasters, retracted an earlier statement and said Japan will continue supporting its analog high-definition television system.
Akimasa Egawa, director-general of the broadcast bureau at Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, told reporters that Japan will not abandon its home-grown HDTV standard, which the Japan Broadcasting Corp. started developing more than 30 years ago.
On Tuesday, Mr. Egawa made widely reported remarks suggesting that the postal ministry would abandon broadcasts of analog HDTV and would concentrate on a digital version of HDTV similar to those now under development in the U.S. and Europe.
Many experts consider Japan's analog version of HDTV inferior to experimental digital systems in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Analysts believe Japan will eventually have to abandon its analog standard, but that day now has been postponed.
Mr. Egawa's earlier remarks drew heavy fire from electronics makers who stood to lose their heavy investment in analog HDTV sets.
