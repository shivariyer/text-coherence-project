The board committee of U.K.'s Newspaper Publishing PLC is backing a revised takeover bid from Mirror Group Newspapers PLC that includes a cash alternative.
The revised offer would allow Newspaper Publishing shareholders to take 355 pence ($5.29) a share in cash for their holdings rather than the proposed share swap.
The value of the cash election represents a 180% premium over Newspaper Publishing's share price prior to the takeover bid launched in February, the consortium said.
The cash option values the company, which publishes London newspapers the Independent and Independent on Sunday, at #74.7 million ($111.3 million).
The consortium's earlier bid still stands.
It offers #104.3 cash for every 100 ordinary shares of Newspaper Publishing and 135 new Mirror Group ordinary shares for each one-pence share.
The ordinary share offer values each ordinary share of Newspaper Publishing at 336.7 pence.
