The Dec. 22 editorial-page essay by Dorothy Rabinowitz, "An Army of Schindlers From Italy," properly recognizes the extraordinary efforts of the Italian nation generally -- and Italy's military in particular -- to save Jews from extermination.
In a world where the democracies did precious little to provide a haven for those destined to die in Nazi death camps, the inspired courage and resourcefulness of Germany's Italian ally in defying Hitler deserves our admiration and respect.
At the same time, let us not forget to add to the list of Schindler-type heroes the nation of Denmark, which in the midst of a brutal Nazi occupation, managed to save its entire Jewish population of 8,000 from the gas chambers in 1943 -- aided and abetted by German officers who defied Berlin by tipping off Danish officials to Nazi plans to round up all Danish Jews and ship them to concentration camps.
Denmark's total population, led by King Christian X, organized a massive underground effort to hide the Jews and smuggle them to Sweden across the Sund waterway, while much of the occupying German army obstructed Gestapo plans by looking the other way.
What motivates heroes like Oskar Schindler is a subject for endless debate.
What is important is to recognize their selfless acts and hold them up as examples of conscience, compassion and courage for others to follow.
On Jan. 11, in observance of the 50th anniversary of the Danish rescue of the Jews, 15,000 handwritten letters of thanks from American Jewish children to the people of Denmark will be presented by a group of youngsters to Leif Donde, Consul-General of Denmark in New York, who will accept them on behalf of Queen Margarethe II, granddaughter of King Christian X. The letters will be displayed at the Danish Resistance Museum in Copenhagen.
Mr. Donde was one of the 8,000 Jews who were saved by his fellow Danes half a century ago.
Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler
