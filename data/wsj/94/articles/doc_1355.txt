Midlantic Corp. and its Midlantic National Bank subsidiary have been freed of regulatory restrictions.
Responding to the bank's much-improved financial condition, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Comptroller of the Currency lifted regulatory agreements that had, among other things, prevented the Edison, N.J., banking company from paying a dividend.
Hammered by nonperforming real-estate loans, the bank had been operating under an agreement with the Comptroller since December 1990.
But the bank has since cleaned up its balance sheet, made massive cuts in its operating costs, and returned to profitability.
"This is an endorsement of the company's recovery," said Carole Berger, a bank analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
She predicts the bank will restore the dividend "later this year or for sure sometime next year."
A company representative said the board will take up the dividend issue "in the near future."
