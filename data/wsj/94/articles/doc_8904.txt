With the exception of blacks, the number of minorities who received doctorates increased substantially between 1982 and 1992, according to the American Council on Education.
Overall, 27% more minorities earned Ph.D.s in 1992 than 10 years earlier, while the overall number of doctorates climbed about 6%, the group said.
Minorities accounted for 2,682 of the 25,759 doctorates awarded in 1992.
Asians had an 83% gain, receiving 828 doctorates in 1992, up from 452 in 1982, while Hispanics had a 41% gain to 755 from 535.
Native Americans nearly doubled their numbers to 148 from 77 a decade earlier.
But blacks saw a 9.2% decline, finishing 1992 with 951 degrees earned, compared with 1,047 in 1982.
The drop was due to a sharp fall in degrees awarded to black males, who had a 20% decline.
Black females showed minimal gains.
Ph.D.s in education continued to be the most popular doctorates among minorities, accounting for 29% of minority doctorates, the report said.
Meanwhile, the congressional General Accounting Office has concluded that fewer than 5% of all undergraduate and graduate scholarships were targeted to minorities in the 1991-92 school year.
