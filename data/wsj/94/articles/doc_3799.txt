Vice President Al Gore is enlisting corporate executives to publicize government programs aimed at boosting the semiconductor industry.
Although a news briefing scheduled tomorrow is being billed as a "new partnership between government and industry," most of the initiatives to be discussed have been introduced previously.
In one new program, Mr. Gore is expected to announce that the Commerce Department is planning to establish a metrology center at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to consolidate government research into semiconductor measurements.
Mr. Gore also is expected to lay out details about the Semiconductor Technology Council, a group that was included in the Defense Department's authorization bill this past fall.
The council is supposed to push for government funding of parts of a technology "road map" laid out last year by the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group.
Despite industry urging, however, Mr. Gore isn't expected to name industry members for the council, because of delays in the selection process.
Council members from the government have been designated by law.
Mr. Gore, who is to be joined by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and officials from the Pentagon and the Environmental Protection Agency, is planning to emphasize the role of the semiconductor industry in building the so-called information superhighway.
