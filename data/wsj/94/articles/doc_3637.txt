Commenting on allegations by the Food and Drug Administration, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. said tobacco companies have lowered tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes in the past 40 years by more than 60%.
The company released a letter to FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, prompted by the FDA's comment this week that there is growing evidence that tobacco companies deliberately maintain the level of nicotine in cigarettes at addictive levels.
James W. Johnston, chairman and chief executive officer of the tobacco-making unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., said, "R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. does NOT increase the nicotine in the tobacco we use in the manufacture of our cigarettes."
The letter cited industry statistics showing that the average nicotine level in cigarettes has fallen to 0.8 milligram since the early 1950s from 2.7 milligrams, and the average tar level has dropped to 11.5 milligrams from 37 milligrams.
