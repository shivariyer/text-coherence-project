California Gov. Pete Wilson's official in charge of damage estimates for the Jan. 17 Los Angeles-area earthquake said the cost may be "near the lower end" of a range between $13 billion and $20 billion.
At a news conference in Pasadena, Richard Andrews, director of the state's office of emergency services, said current estimates put damages "perhaps at $15 billion."
In the days immediately after the quake, state officials had estimated that damage from the quake would be between $15 billion and $30 billion, and had called such numbers conservative.
"As we continue with our inspections and get a better handle on the possible damage to underground water and sewage lines and private damage, we will update those figures for you periodically," Mr. Andrews said.
Separately, in a letter to Gov. Wilson, state Director of Finance Russell S. Gould estimated the public cost of the quake at $11.6 billion to the federal government, $1.9 billion to the state of California, and $135 million to state and local governments.
Mr. Gould's letter stressed, however, that the estimates "will change over time as new information becomes available."
