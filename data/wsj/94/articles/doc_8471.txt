The U.S. Labor Department said a federal court in New York awarded 224 employees of Waldbaum Inc. more than $1.8 million in back wages and damages due to violations of record-keeping and overtime-labor laws.
In October, Judge Charles H. Tenney had determined the company unintentionally, but improperly, violated the labor laws, and asked the Labor Department to calculate back wages owed to employees.
Judge Tenney also issued an order prohibiting Waldbaum from further violations.
Waldbaum is a unit of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., a grocery chain majority-owned by Tengelmann Group of Germany.
In Montvale, N.J., an A&P spokesman said that the violations were unintentional and that employees are now fully paid.
