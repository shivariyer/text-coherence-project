Farmers Insurance Group estimated it will pay $600 million in claims for the Los Angeles earthquake, one of the highest claims payouts yet reported by an insurance company on the disaster.
The claims are about evenly split between commercial claims and claims filed by individuals on their homes and cars.
So far, 27,000 claims have been reported.
The Los Angeles-based company, a unit of B.A.TT Industries PLC, is the country's third-largest home insurer.
The nation's largest home insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Association, also said it will pay at least $600 million in claims.
The company has received 80,000 claims.
Insurance companies expect to pay $2.5 billion on the earthquake, making it one of the most expensive insurance disasters in U.S. history.
