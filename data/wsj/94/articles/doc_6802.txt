POCO PETROLEUMS Ltd., Calgary, Alberta, said it expects to raise 98.9 million Canadian dollars (US$74.4 million), after commissions, on the sale of new shares to an underwriting syndicate led by Burns Fry Ltd., Toronto.
The oil and gas producer said it reached an agreement with the group to issue 10 million common shares from the treasury at C$10.30 each on a bought-deal basis.
The transaction would raise the number of Poco shares outstanding to about 92.7 million.
The company said it will use proceeds to finance oil and gas exploration and development projects and property acquisitions, and initially to reduce long-term debt.
It said it plans to file a preliminary prospectus today and expects the transaction to close Feb. 22.
