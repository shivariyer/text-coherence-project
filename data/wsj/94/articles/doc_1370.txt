Tyco International Ltd., in a new attempt to outbid rivals in the acquisition of Mark Controls Corp., proposed a $19-a-share tender offer, or a total of about $95 million, for all the company's shares outstanding.
Tyco International, based in Exeter, N.H., is a maker of fire-protection equipment.
Mark Controls, in Skokie, Ill., manufactures industrial valves.
Mark Controls agreed last week to be acquired by Danaher Corp. for $17.75 a share, or about $89 million, after a bidding war involving rivals Crane Co. and Tyco International.
With the latest offer, William E. Bendix, Mark Controls chief executive, said the company is now in discussions with both Tyco and Danaher and will "evaluate the alternatives available."
