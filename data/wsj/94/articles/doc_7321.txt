A court-appointed trustee overseeing the bankruptcy restructuring of Towers Financial Corp. sued its former chairman and others for $1.2 billion, claiming they defrauded the company of more than $400 million.
In a suit filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, Alan Cohen, the trustee, charged that Steven Hoffenberg "systematically covered up" $400 million in losses at the debt-collection company by reporting "blatantly false financial statements."
In addition, the suit asserts that Mr. Hoffenberg, who made an unsuccessful bid for the New York Post last year, and others "grossly overstated" Towers's assets, and that they created accounting records to support the alleged fraudulent financial statements so that he could borrow hundreds of millions of dollars from creditors and investors to "aggrandize himself and support his extravagant lifestyle."
The suit is seeking treble damages under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute.
Mr. Hoffenberg declined to comment.
His attorney, Michael Rosoff, who also is named in the suit, said he hadn't yet seen the suit and couldn't comment on it.
"It's the fifth separate lawsuit that Alan Cohen has filed against Mr. Hoffenberg, which doesn't strike me as being a particularly efficient or appropriate use of Towers's assets," Mr. Rosoff said.
As trustee, Mr. Cohen is currently conducting an auction to sell Towers.
A bankruptcy judge is scheduled to hear the results of the auction Wednesday.
Towers filed for protection from creditors under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code last March.
Mr. Hoffenberg faces civil-fraud charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission and has been penalized in two states for keeping debts that his companies had collected for clients.
