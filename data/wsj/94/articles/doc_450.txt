Cargill Inc. will expand its oilseed processing plants at Sioux City, Iowa, and Iowa Falls, Iowa, instead of reopening its Savage, Minn., plant, which closed four years ago.
In a news release, Cargill said processing capacity at the two facilities will be increased by about 25,000 bushels a day.
Permits are being secured, and construction at the two sites will begin in the spring of 1995, the company said.
Cargill is an international marketer and processor of agricultural, industrial and financial commodities.
