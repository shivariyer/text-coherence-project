Baxter International Inc. signed multiyear supply agreements with a major hospital group that last year curtailed its dealings with the company over concerns about Baxter's "ethics and business practices."
Baxter, a hospital-supply concern, valued the agreements with Premier Health Alliance at about $300 million over their life.
Premier is a cooperative that, among other services, makes purchases on behalf of about 190 hospitals and health systems nationwide.
The pacts include a five-year agreement calling for Baxter Healthcare Corp. to provide Premier with surgical-procedure kits and sterile gowns.
The two other contracts are three-year agreements to provide the Westchester, Ill., alliance with devices and catheters used in heart surgery.
In the spring of 1993, Premier said it would reduce its business with Baxter by up to $50 million in the coming 12 months; it had been making about $250 million in annual purchases from Baxter.
Baxter's guilty plea, in March of last year, to a charge of violating federal law prohibiting cooperation with the Arab boycott of Israel played a role in Premier's decision.
But it also reflected unhappiness over what Premier then characterized as a "series of incidents over the last four years that undermined member hospitals' confidence in Baxter's ethics and business practices."
A spokeswoman confirmed that the alliance has in fact taken business away from Baxter.
"We have carried out the directive member hospitals gave us last spring, to reduce by up to $50 million our business with Baxter," she said.
But she added that the alliance continues to evaluate existing or new business opportunities with Baxter, and to "make decisions on awarding contracts based on the best overall value they bring to our hospital members."
She said the alliance will continue to make its evaluations on a contract-by-contract basis, and "we also continue to monitor Baxter's progress to improve the business relationship" with its big customer.
