Rayrock Yellowknife Resources Inc., Toronto, said it agreed to purchase the 56% stake it doesn't already own in the Dee gold mine in Nevada for $21.1 million.
A subsidiary of Homestake Mining Co., San Francisco, owns 44% of the mine, and a 12% stake is held by an individual who helped discover the gold deposit.
Rayrock, a Toronto mining and oil-and-gas concern, said the Dee mine produced about 26,000 ounces of gold in 1993 and has proven reserves of 169,000 ounces.
The company said between 700,000 and 800,000 ounces of gold at a newly discovered deposit at the mine is "likely to be mineable," if the price of gold climbs to $400 an ounce or higher.
The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval.
Rayrock said it will finance the acquisition with its working capital and available lines of bank credit.
