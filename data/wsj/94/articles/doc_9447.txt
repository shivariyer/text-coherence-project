Public Service Co. of New Mexico, Albuquerque, N.M., said it plans to take a fourth-quarter write-down of $112 million, or $2.69 a share, related to an expected rate reduction.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, the utility had a net loss of $133.2 million, or $3.23 a share, after certain charges.
Revenue was $216.6 million.
The utility said yesterday that it has agreed with the staff of the New Mexico Public Utility Commission to reduce electric rates by $30 million, or 6.5%, a year.
The agreement is subject to approval by the three members of the commission.
A write-down had been expected by securities analysts.
Thus, Public Service's stock closed unchanged at $11.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Public Service said that it will achieve the rate reduction by, among other things, reducing operating costs by $10 million a year and the write-down.
