Spaghetti Warehouse Inc. ousted Louis Neeb as chairman, chief executive and president, citing philosophical differences over the direction of the Italian-restaurant chain.
The company's founder and former chairman, Robert R. Hawk, was named to succeed Mr. Neeb as chairman.
Mr. Hawk was also named interim chief executive and interim president.
Spaghetti Warehouse announced the news after the close of business yesterday.
Company officials couldn't be reached to elaborate.
Mr. Neeb, who was named president in 1991 and became chairman in October, also couldn't be reached.
The company said its expansion would be curtailed until a new CEO and president is named.
The 21-year-old chain, with most of its restaurants located in converted urban warehouses, shifted gears last year and started to open restaurants in suburban areas.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Spaghetti Warehouse shares were down 50 cents to $7.875.
The stock had traded as high as $19.50 a year ago and $30.75 in late 1991.
