Four music distribution companies said they settled lawsuits challenging their efforts to bar music retailers from selling used compact discs.
The music companies last year had attempted to curtail the growth of used CD sales in retail stores by withholding advertising dollars to retailers that traded in the used CDs.
Terms of the settlement weren't disclosed.
The four music companies said they felt their policies were lawful, but they feared the dispute would sour relations with retailers.
The music companies included Sony Corp.'s Sony Music Entertainment Inc., the Warner/Elektra/Atlantic Corp. unit of Time Warner Inc., Thorn EMI PLC's CEMA Distribution, and UNI Distribution, a part of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s MCA Inc.
