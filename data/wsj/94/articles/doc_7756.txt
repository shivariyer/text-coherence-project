KPMG Peat Marwick, a major accounting firm, said that its Australian affiliate will pay $97 million to settle a suit alleging faulty audits of a state-owned merchant bank that collapsed four years ago.
The settlement is one of the biggest ever made by an accounting firm in Australia, according to attorneys familiar with audit-negligence cases.
In 1992, the Australian state of Victoria sued Peat Marwick Hungerfords, alleging malpractice in its audits of Tricontinental Group bank, a subsidiary of the State Bank of Victoria.
The bank had lent money to Australian business people who tried without success to take over certain U.S. entertainment companies.
The bank collapsed in 1990 with $1.85 billion in debt.
The suit alleged that Peat Marwick Hungerfords failed to detect the bank's problems in time to avert the bank's failure.
Peat said that despite the settlement, which is covered by insurance, it doesn't admit any wrongdoing.
