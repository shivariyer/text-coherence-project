Nike Inc. said it will put up $25,000 to help Tonya Harding defend herself if there is an effort to bounce the figure skater from the U.S. Olympic team.
Nike officials said the offer isn't contingent on whether Ms. Harding is guilty or innocent of allegations by her ex-husband that she approved an assault on her figure-skating rival, Nancy Kerrigan, last month in Detroit.
The ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, made the allegation in a negotiated guilty plea yesterday.
Ms. Harding hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing, and no formal move has been made so far to bar her from Olympic competition.
A Nike spokesman yesterday said the company was concerned with "the issue of athlete's rights" in the Harding case.
The $25,000 would be earmarked only to defend the figure skater against any efforts by Olympic Committee officials to keep her from competing in the games later this month, he said.
Olympic Committee officials have declined to comment on Ms. Harding's situation.
The committee has said it will decide before Feb. 10 whether to strip the skater of her U.S. Figure Skating Association membership, a move that would keep her out of the Olympics.
