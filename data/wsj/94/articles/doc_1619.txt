Moody's Investors Services Inc. downgraded its ratings of the long-term debt, preferred stock and commercial paper of this natural resources, chemicals and food processing company.
About $5 billion of debt is affected.
Citing depressed oil prices, slumping chemical markets and Occidental's "weak" cashf-low protection measures, Moody's downgraded long-term debt to Baa-3 from Baa-2.
The rating on preferred stock was downgraded to Ba-1 from Baa-3, and commercial paper was lowering to Prime-3 from Prime-2.
The company said it had to comment on the move.
