R.H. Macy & Co.'s board, riven by internal dissension, failed to agree on an outline of a reorganization plan for the retailer, which is struggling to stay independent after it leaves bankruptcy-law protection.
Chief Executive Officer Myron E. Ullman III asked Cyrus R. Vance, the court-appointed mediator, for one more day to come up with the company's proposal, which creditors are scheduled to hear tomorrow.
The stalemate comes as the result of an 11th-hour maneuver by board member Laurence Tisch, who urged Macy's directors to weigh alternatives to the plan Macy management has been negotiating with General Electric Co.'s GE Capital unit and mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments.
Mr. Tisch is arguing that Macy should value itself at $3.8 billion in its plan, a move intended to distribute greater value to Macy's public bondholders.
The GE-Fidelity joint plan values the company at a lower $3.5 billion.
The board's indecision is viewed as a blow to Macy's Mr. Ullman, who took the lead in proposing the plan with Fidelity and GE Capital to fend off unwanted suitor Federated Department Stores Inc.
However, if Macy's board comes up with a plan deemed distasteful by secured creditors, which include Fidelity and GE Capital, those creditors may back Federated.
Under bankruptcy law, senior creditors can block a reorganization plan.
Daniel Harmetz, the Fidelity manager who has been negotiating with Macy, has already said he would withdraw his support should the board value Macy above $3.5 billion.
Macy senior creditors, who get paid off first under bankruptcy law, are owed $2.4 billion, plus interest.
The largest piece of senior debt is jointly owned by Prudential Insurance Co. of America and Federated.
