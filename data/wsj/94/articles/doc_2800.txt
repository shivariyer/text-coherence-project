IBM thought it had an idea that could lower its own travel costs and make an offer the airlines couldn't refuse.
But they did.
In current negotiations with the nation's two largest carriers, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, International Business Machines Corp. added an unusual request.
It asked for steeper-than-usual corporate discounts; in exchange, IBM said the airlines could retain the frequent-flier miles that they would normally distribute to traveling employees.
The benefits to IBM's bottom line, if not to its employees, are obvious: Travel costs go down.
The airlines, at least in theory, also could benefit.
Carriers are increasingly concerned about the number of non-revenue passengers -- they represent more than 6% of all customers -- and about the growth generally of unused frequent-flier miles, which represent liabilities on the airlines' balance sheets.
"We weren't interested in the concept," a United spokesman said.
Neither was American.
The airlines won't elaborate, but industry officials say the carriers feared they would be blamed by thousands of IBM employees for withholding their precious miles.
