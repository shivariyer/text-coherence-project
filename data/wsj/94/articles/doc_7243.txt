Murphy Oil Corp. said it will cut administrative costs by offering holders of small lots the opportunity to sell their shares without paying a commission.
The oil and natural gas company, based in El Dorado, Ark., said holders of fewer than 100 shares of Murphy common stock or fewer than 182 shares of Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co., a company Murphy acquired in 1991, can sell those shares through Shareholders Communications Corp. without paying a fee.
The oil and natural gas company said the program is open to stock of record Jan. 21 and will expire Feb. 25.
A company spokesman estimated there were 4,400 lots of less than 100 Murphy shares and 1,500 lots of less than 182 Ocean Drilling shares.
