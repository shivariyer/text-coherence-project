ADVANCED MEDICAL Inc. said it omitted its 50-cents-a-share semiannual dividend on its 10% cumulative preferred stock and delayed the planned redemption of the series' 400,000 outstanding shares.
Advanced Medical, a San Diego-based maker of intravenous-infusion equipment, said the dividend payment and redemption would have led to the violation of loan agreements with its senior lender.
"Negotiations to refinance the company's nonpublic debt are continuing, and we chose to delay payments on the preferred stock to enhance the company's ability to meet scheduled debt commitments and to conserve cash during this critical phase.
We do not expect to make any further payments on the preferred stock until the debt restructuring is completed," Joseph W. Kuhn, vice president, said.
