Suntory Ltd., the largest whisky distiller in Japan, reported that its unconsolidated pretax profit for 1993 was off 5.2% from 1992.
Pretax profit for the period was 9.18 billion yen ($87.7 million), down from 9.68 billion yen a year earlier.
Sales fell 2.8% to 737.28 billion yen.
The company is predicting that beer sales will fall 5.2% to 178.90 billion yen during 1994 from 188.72 billion yen during 1993, reflecting Suntory's decision to end a license agreement with U.S. brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos. under which Suntory produced Budweiser beer in Japan.
