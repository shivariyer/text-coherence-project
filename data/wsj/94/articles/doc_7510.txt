Johnston Industries Inc., despite strong operating profit, expects to post a more than 40% decline in fiscal second-quarter net income, mainly due to portfolio losses in an investment company in which Johnston holds a 44% stake.
In an interview, officials of the textile company said they expect to post a decline in net for the quarter ended Dec. 31 to about 10 cents a share, or about $1.1 million, from 17 cents a share, or $1.9 million.
Per-share numbers for a year ago reflect a 3-for-2 stock split effective earlier this week.
Nonetheless, David L. Chandler, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We think we can comfortably exceed earnings per share of a year ago for the full year," adjusted for the stock split.
He also said the company is reviewing raising the dividend, possibly in the third quarter.
The company last raised the dividend 25% in December 1992, to eight cents a share.
For the second quarter, Gerald B. Andrews, president and chief operating officer, explained that Johnston's stake in Jupiter National Inc., a publicly traded venture capital firm, would result in a pretax loss for Johnston of $174,000.
Jupiter had a $3 million portfolio loss related to an investment in Zoll Medical Corp., a company whose stock has since nearly recovered.
A year ago, Jupiter National contributed pretax profit of $2.8 million to Johnston's earnings.
Mr. Chandler said, however, that Johnston expects the Jupiter National portfolio to provide positive benefits to the company in the third and fourth quarters.
The officials expect to report a 12% to 14% increase in sales for the second quarter, from the year-ago $33.7 million.
The overall order backlog for the period was up about 13% to 14% from the previous year.
Mr. Andrews also was optimistic about the balance of the fiscal year.
For the year ended June 30, 1993, Johnston had net of $8.9 million, or 81 cents a share, restated for the split.
Sales were $154.1 million.
