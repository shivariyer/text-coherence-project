I read your article on Texas mutual funds, and I was disappointed that it emphasized the negative aspects of longer-term performance histories.
I acknowledge that the five-year and 10-year performance records of the funds you mentioned trail the industry averages.
But I would point out the progress that our fund has made in the past few years, and the environment in which we have operated.
Concorde Value Fund Inc. is a no-load equity fund operating under the value tradition, a philosophy that did not perform well during the late 1980s.
Instead, it was a period when growth funds were the favored investment, and our fund's performance during those years reflects the market's bias.
However, over the past three years, we have made significant progress.
The fund's three-year annualized return ranks it in the 27th percentile of Morningstar's group of growth and income funds, and is 11% higher than Morningstar's comparable index for growth and income funds.
Morningstar's risk-adjusted rating, in contrast to Lipper's total-return statistic, is a combination of performance and risk, designed to express the relative attractiveness of a fund's risk/reward profile.
A rating of "3" indicates that Concorde Value Fund's relative attractiveness was in the middle 35% of funds in its class as of Dec. 31, 1993, an improvement over the rating of "2" that the fund had held since March 31, 1992.
Morningstar's three-year risk rating evaluates a fund's downside volatility, or how risky the fund is, relative to that of other funds in its class.
That rating also has improved since 1992.
