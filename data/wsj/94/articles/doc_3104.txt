Dragon Systems Inc., a closely held maker of speech recognition software, unveiled new products with bigger vocabularies and lower prices.
Dragon said its new DragonDictate Classic Edition, which works with IBM-compatible personal computers, recognizes as many as 60,000 words and costs $1,995.
That's twice the vocabulary at the same price as its previous top-of-the line product.
One competitor, Kurzweil Applied Intelligence Inc., Waltham, Mass., has a 50,000-word vocabulary system that costs $2,995.
International Business Machines Corp. makes a 20,000-word speech recognition system with a list price of $990.
Dragon also announced an improved 30,000-word system for $995 and a 5,000-word "starter edition" for $695.
Dragon's speech recognition systems are speaker-independent, but their accuracy improves as they get used to a particular speaker's inflection.
Like all large-vocabulary speech-recognition systems, DragonDictate requires speakers to pause briefly between words.
Speech recognition systems have been getting closer to the ideal of a typewriter that can take dictation in recent years, but sales have remained slow because of cost.
Four years ago, Dragon's 30,000-word system was priced at $9,000.
Janet Baker, president of Dragon, said "we think with prices coming down more people will try it."
