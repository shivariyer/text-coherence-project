CXR Corp. said it will issue 6.3 million shares to Houston investment firm Daniel Dror & Co. for $2.52 million, giving Dror a controlling stake in the company.
After the transaction, Dror will hold 7.8 million shares, or 50.2% of CXR's common shares outstanding.
Dror currently holds 1.5 million shares, or a 16% stake.
CXR, a San Jose, Calif., maker of telephone-testing equipment and modems, said it will use the proceeds to make acquisitions and expand its product line.
The company said it used a previous $600,000 cash infusion from Dror to pay off substantially all its bank debt.
Last November, CXR named Dror's principal, Daniel Dror, chairman of CXR, effective Jan. 25.
Mr. Dror succeeded Raymond E. Jacobson, 71 years old, who is retiring.
