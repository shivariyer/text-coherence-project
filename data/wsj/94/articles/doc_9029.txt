PAGING NETWORK Inc., Dallas, said it sold $300 million of senior subordinated notes due 2006, priced at 8 7/8% for sale at par.
The sale was an increase from $200 million of notes originally offered.
The paging-services concern said the notes are rated single-B-2 and single-B by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Corp., respectively.
The notes were drawn from the company's recently filed $600 million shelf registration.
Paging Network said it will use net proceeds of the sale to repay the debt under its revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. led the underwriting.
