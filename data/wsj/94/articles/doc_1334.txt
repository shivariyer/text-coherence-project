New York's City Council voted to extend the rent stabilization and rent-control laws for three years until April 1, 1997.
The Council also voted 28-18 to adopt a measure that would limit the rights of certain wealthy individuals and families to take advantage of these laws.
The measure calls for apartments that rent for $2,000 or more a month after April 1, 1994, to be deregulated once they are vacated or their leases expire if these units are occupied by households whose income exceeded $250,000 a year for the previous two calendar years.
As previously reported, New York state legislators last year enacted a law affecting wealthy individuals whose rent exceeded $2,000 a month as of Oct. 1, 1993.
The City Council's measure extends the deadline for six more months.
New York City housing experts say that the deregulation measure will affect fewer than 1% of the more than one million rent-regulated households throughout the city's five boroughs.
Landlords and other opponents of rent regulation had also backed other proposals, which were rejected, that would have further restricted rent regulation.
New York City's rent laws were the subject of a front page Wall Street Journal article Monday.
