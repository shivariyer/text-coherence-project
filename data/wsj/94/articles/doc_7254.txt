Thermo Electron Corp. said two of its public subsidiaries acquired analytical instrument and process-control businesses from Baker Hughes Inc. for $134 million.
Thermo Instrument Systems Inc. will pay $93 million for units that manufacture process-measurement and control equipment, while Thermedics Inc. will acquire the Ramsey Technologies and Epsilon Industrial materials and measurement businesses for $41 million.
Baker Hughes' EnviroTech, Noran Instruments, TN Technologies and Tremetrics units will go to Thermo Instrument.
The four businesses had combined sales of $129 million in the year ended Sept. 30.
Ramsey, which makes equipment that weighs and inspects bulk-packaged materials, and Epsilon, a development-stage company working on equipment that measures the moisture content of materials, had combined revenue of $59 million in the year ended Sept. 30.
Baker Hughes said the price for the units is "slightly in excess" of its total investment.
The company said the agreement, which is expected to close by the end of next month, does not include the computer peripherals business in Europe, Tracor Europa.
Thermedics, which makes explosives and drug-detection equipment, said the acquisitions will help extend its new quality-assurance product line for the beverage industry to related markets such as food inspection.
Thermo Instrument, an instrument maker, said it gains new technology in the on-line process instrumentation market.
Separately, Thermo Remediation Inc., another public Thermo unit, declared its first cash dividend, of 15 cents a share, payable March 15 to holders of record Feb. 15.
The company said it intends to pay a cash dividend semi-annually.
