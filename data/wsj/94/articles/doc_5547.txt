National Security Group Inc. said a circuit-court jury in Russell County, Ala., ordered a company subsidiary to pay $3.5 million in a personnel case.
The verdict against National Security Insurance Co. stemmed from litigation involving the demotion and reassignment of a marketing representative.
National Security Group said its subsidiary is filing post-trial motions and intends to file an appeal, if necessary, to the Alabama Supreme Court.
A spokesman for National Security Group, an insurer based in Elba, Ala., said the company would be in a better position to determine what consequences, if any, the verdict might have on its accounting statements once all post-trial motions have been ruled upon.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday, National Security Group closed at $26 a share, unchanged.
