DuPont Co. opened a representative office in Ho Chi Minh City in anticipation of new business opportunities in Vietnam.
DuPont is among the biggest U.S. firms to invest in Vietnam since the U.S. trade embargo was lifted Feb. 3.
DuPont said in a statement that it anticipates a promising outlook for the agricultural, construction and textile industries in Vietnam and "intends to fully participate in these sectors."
David Pang, vice president for DuPont Asia Pacific, indicated that the company hopes to quadruple its sales in the Asia-Pacific region to $10 billion by the year 2000, or about 20% of DuPont's total global sales.
