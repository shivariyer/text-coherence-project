Winterthur Insurance Co. said it will acquire a majority stake in German insurer DBV-Holding AG from Germany's Commerzbank AG.
While Winterthur declined to disclose total value of the transaction, some analysts suggested the multi-step transaction might cost around 700 million Swiss francs ($473.6 million).
Winterthur has had trouble expanding market share in Germany.
Last month, Winterthur sold its 28%-stake in the Swiss medium-sized insurance company Helvetia Versicherungen, which has a strong market position in Germany, because Helvetia had vowed to remain independent.
Also, Winterthur swapped its 37.4%-holding in Germany's Nordstern Allgemeine Versicherungs AG for 3% of the share capital of France's Union des Assurances de Paris, known as UAP, after Winterthur failed to obtain a majority position in Nordstern.
With the DBV acquisition, the Swiss company's share of the German market will climb to around 3% from 1% before.
Winterthur said that Commerzbank in a first step will transfer its majority stake of 50% plus one share in DBV-Holding to an intermediate holding company to be jointly owned by Winterthur and Commerzbank.
Winterthur will become a majority shareholder in that intermediate company, to be called Commerzbank/Winterthur Holding, by acquiring a 75%-interest less one share in the course of this year, while Commerzbank will end up with a 25%-holding plus one share.
In the final stage of the transaction, DBV-Winterthur-Holding will be created with Commerzbank/Winterthur Holding owning a 50%-interest plus one share; public shareholders, 25% minus two shares; and the DBV public legal institute, 25% plus one share, Winterthur said.
