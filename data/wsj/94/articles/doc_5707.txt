Societe Commerciale de l'Ouest Africain, an international trading subsidiary of Cie. Financiere de Paribas, said its chairman has resigned, citing the company's financial difficulties.
SCOA shares plunged 3.4% on the Paris Bourse to 8.65 francs ($1.45) from 8.94 francs on volume of 221,000 shares Thursday.
The board appointed Guy de Narbonne, SCOA's managing director, to be interim chairman.
SCOA said its financial difficulties, together with last month's 50% devaluation of the CFA African franc, "have led the company to abandon development projects that were planned in the distribution sector in France."
It said SCOA is retrenching and will devote efforts to reducing debt.
The CFA African franc, the currency used in 14 French-speaking African countries, was devalued by 50% against the French franc last month -- the first time the currency had been adjusted since 1948.
As a result, earnings of Franc Zone subsidiaries of foreign companies have been halved, as have the values of their assets.
A group of French corporate investors estimates that the currency adjustment will cost French companies with Franc Zone operations a total of 10 billion francs ($1.67 billion).
There are about 1,200 subsidiaries of 80 French companies in the region.
Paribas owns a 53.7% majority interest in SCOA, which has extensive trading interests in French West Africa.
Paribas indicated recently that its 1993 earnings had been eroded by losses incurred by SCOA, but it didn't provide any figures.
SCOA has been a financial drain on Paribas for many years.
In the first six months of 1993 alone, SCOA incurred an attributable consolidated loss of almost 600 million francs ($100.5 million), compared with 136.2 million francs in the same period of 1992.
The company posted a loss of 277 million francs in 1992, up from 199.7 million francs a year earlier.
The company has made a number of strategic errors in recent years, one being a diversification into computer distribution in Europe through a subsidiary called Omnilogic International.
The unit contributed 482 million francs of SCOA's 1993 first-half loss before it was sold off in September for a symbolic franc.
The first-half loss meant that SCOA's debts exceeded its assets, and Paribas was forced to come to its rescue with a transfusion of 200 million francs of fresh capital.
The company then cut the nominal value of its shares to 1 franc from 20 francs, and slashed its capital to 90 million francs from 1.82 billion, wiping out more than a billion francs of accumulated losses in the process.
A remaining 681 million francs were transferred to a reserve account to be used to offset new losses in 1993.
One of SCOA's main activities is distributing automobiles in France and in eight African countries, and the company bore the full brunt of the 15% drop in French car sales last year.
SCOA has been trying to reduce its indebtedness with asset sales in recent years.
Its consolidated revenue fell by more than 40% between 1990 and 1992 to 7.39 billion francs.
