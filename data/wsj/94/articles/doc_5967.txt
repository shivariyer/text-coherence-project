BETHLEHEM STEEL Corp., Bethlehem, Pa., said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed public offering of 12 million common shares.
The steelmaker said 10.2 million shares will be offered in the U.S., while 1.8 million will be sold internationally.
Bethlehem said it plans to contribute all or substantially all of the offering's proceeds to the company's pension fund; any remaining proceeds will be used for general purposes, including capital expenditures for modernization.
Bethlehem said Salomon Brothers will be lead manager for the offering.
The overallotment option is for 1.8 million additional shares.
Bethlehem currently has 91.5 million common shares outstanding.
If all of the offered shares are sold and the full overallotment option is exercised, the company will then have about 105.3 million common shares outstanding.
