Cintas Corp. said bad winter weather and the earthquake in Los Angeles that interrupted business would cause "a loss in total sales" of about $500,000 in the fiscal third quarter.
The Cincinnati-based uniform company added there will be "a one-time, adverse impact on net income" of about $500,000, or one cent a share, for the period ending Feb. 28.
In the year-earlier period, Cintas posted net income of $11 million, or 24 cents a share, on sales of $112.8 million.
"There is no on-going negative impact to the company from these events," Cintas said.
"The manufacturing facilities have fully recovered and business is back to usual."
Cintas said snow temporarily interrupted business in its Midwestern and Northeastern operations and caused the temporary closing of three manufacturing plants in Kentucky and forced the company "to procure garments from alternative suppliers at a higher cost."
