The federal trial of Phar-Mor Inc. co-founder and former President Michael I. Monus has been continued at his request, said James V. Moroney, assistant U.S. attorney.
The trial was scheduled to start Feb. 14 in federal court in Cleveland.
Mr. Monus petitioned to put off the trial, citing difficulties getting access to Phar-Mor records and witnesses and time needed to review the recent release of a report written by a court-appointed examiner.
Despite opposition from the U.S. attorney's office, Judge George White granted Mr. Monus's motion and said he will set a new trial date at a March 2 hearing.
Prosecutors expect the trial to begin in late March or early April.
Mr. Monus was indicted on 129 federal counts for an alleged $500 million fraud of the deep-discount retailer and for embezzling $15 million from the company.
Phar-Mor, based in Youngstown, Ohio, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1992.
Two other former Phar-Mor executives have pleaded guilty to federal charges and are cooperating with the U.S. attorney.
