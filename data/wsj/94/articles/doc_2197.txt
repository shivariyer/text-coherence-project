Emerson Radio Corp., the consumer-electronics maker, said a federal bankruptcy court approved its reorganization plan and that the company plans to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by the end of the month.
Parsippany, N.J.-based Emerson, which filed for bankruptcy protection last September, said the plan includes a rights offering giving shareholders the right to purchase as much as 30% of the reorganized company's stock.
Judge Novalyn L. Winfield in New Jersey on Friday confirmed the plan, which was previously agreed to by the company and its principal creditors.
Under the plan, Emerson, founded in 1947, will receive $75 million from Fidenas Investments Ltd. in Nassau, Bahamas.
That stake will consist of $30 million in equity and $45 million in long-term debt.
Fidenas, which currently owns 20% of Emerson's equity, provided $15 million in debtor-in-possession financing to Emerson.
In return, Fidenas will own 60% of newly issued common shares.
