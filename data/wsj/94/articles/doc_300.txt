Thor Industries Inc. said it entered the business of financing retail recreational-vehicle sales.
The company said Thor Credit Corp., a new finance company, was formed by it and Ganis Credit Corp., a national financial institution engaged in recreational-vehicle and marine financing.
Wade F.B. Thompson, Thor Industries' chairman, described the venture as "an excellent profit opportunity" for Thor, in addition to providing Thor's 650 dealers with a competitive source for sales financing.
Thor is the second-largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles and the largest builder of small and midsized buses in North America.
