Texas Utilities Co.'s TU Electric subsidiary said it will ask the Public Utility Commission to reconsider its decision turning down the company's 15.3% rate increase request.
Although the commission hasn't yet issued a final order, the utility says it understands the increase would be 8.7%.
"This increase is insufficient to cover the cost of sustaining reliable electric service . . . and to begin restoring the company's financial integrity," TU Chairman Erle Nye said.
