New York State Electric & Gas Corp., Binghamton, N.Y., said it will slash its work force by 16% and consolidate several offices as part of a cost-cutting program.
The electric utility said it would trim 800 jobs, including about 200 through attrition, under the program.
The company said the cuts include corporate staff.
In addition, the reorganization will involve local salaried supervisory positions.
New York State Electric & Gas said the plan wouldn't require a restructuring charge.
The company said the weak state economy and increasing tax expenses prompted the reorganization.
Among specific changes, the company plans to close 28 satellite walk-in pay locations, leaving it with 13 walk-in locations.
In addition, it will consolidate electric and gas crews in some regions.
