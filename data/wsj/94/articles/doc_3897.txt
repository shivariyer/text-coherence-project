Players International Inc. said it amended a Securities and Exchange Commission filing and removed 1.5 million shares that the company was to have sold, plus an additional one million shares that insiders were to have sold.
Players, which develops and operates riverboat casinos, said the move reflects its belief that its stock price doesn't reflect the value of its shares.
In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Players' shares rose 87.5 cents, or 3.7%, to $24.625.
