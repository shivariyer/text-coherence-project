Ionics Inc. said its Resources Conservation Co.
International unit signed a $40.2 million contract with Diamo SP, a Czech Republic state enterprise, to provide a system to treat waste that threatens to contaminate drinking water near Prague.
The water-treatment concern said Diamo, which is responsible for cleaning up a former uranium-mining site, will use Resources' system to treat an underground reservoir of sulfuric acid solution formed in the process of extracting uranium ore.
The system is scheduled to begin in two years, Ionics said.
