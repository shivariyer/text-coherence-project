After two years of negotiations, the Ontario government said it completed the sale of SkyDome, home of the Blue Jays baseball team, to a group of private investors for 151 million Canadian dollars (US$110.7 million).
The sale brings to an end the province's nearly decade-long financial nightmare with the stadium, located in downtown Toronto adjacent to the city's landmark CN Tower.
Begun in 1986, SkyDome's construction costs ballooned to nearly C$600 million from an original estimate of C$230 million.
The Ontario government wrote off more than half of these costs, or C$320 million, in 1991.
The new owners of SkyDome, a 28-member group that includes such prominent companies as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Canadian subsidiaries of Ford Motor Co. and Coca-Cola Co., apparently expect the stadium will be profitable with a reduced level of debt.
SkyDome has consistently turned a profit on an operating level, but has been deep in the red after taking interest costs into account.
Besides the 50,000-seat sports stadium, the SkyDome complex includes a hotel, a fitness club and acres of restaurants, including North America's biggest McDonald's.
The stadium has the world's first fully retractable roof, which can be opened or closed in 20 minutes to suit the weather.
Under terms of the purchase, the investment group will pay C$151 million, plus another C$22 million in interest costs dating from when a deal was first struck nearly two years ago.
The Ontario government said the protracted negotiations involved dozens of parties, including the buying group and the various owners of land under SkyDome.
The government said it expects to receive net proceeds from the sale of C$134 million, after paying C$39 million, mainly to settle lawsuits by contractors that helped to build the stadium.
