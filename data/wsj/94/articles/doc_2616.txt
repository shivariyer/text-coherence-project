A U.S. bankruptcy court judge ruled that Mirror Group Newspapers PLC, a former arm of the Robert Maxwell media empire, cannot claim assets of the New York Daily News in its attempt to recover funds looted by the late media baron.
Federal Judge Tina L. Brozman ordered expunged the $95 million Mirror Group claim on Maxwell Newspapers Inc., the holding company formed by Mr. Maxwell to operate the tabloid Daily News.
Mr. Maxwell died mysteriously in November 1991 at sea, after which his empire unraveled amid losses and discoveries of financial irregularities -- including hundreds of millions in missing pension-fund money.
The ruling allows Maxwell Newspapers to distribute a large payout to U.S. creditors, an action held up by the Mirror Group claim, according to Marc Kirschner, a partner of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, which represents Maxwell Newspapers Inc.
Maxwell Newspapers filed for federal bankruptcy protection in 1991.
During bankruptcy, real estate developer Mortimer Zuckerman bought the paper.
Maxwell Newspapers emerged from bankruptcy last June, and has since been liquidated.
The distribution of most of the money to creditors is expected within the next 60 days, said Mr. Kirschner.
There are more than 1,800 individual or corporate creditors with allowed claims.
Judge Brozman, while noting the extent of the Maxwells' scheme, ruled that "Maxwell Newspapers derived no benefit and retained no fruit of the Maxwells' fraud."
Judge Brozman concluded in her ruling that Mr. Maxwell's interest in purchasing and operating the Daily News, "was to keep the newspaper alive so that Maxwell Newspapers could function as a money-laundering device" for his own purposes.
