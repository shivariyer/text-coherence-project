Halliburton Co., Dallas, said it expects to report a pretax charge of $62 million, related to the previous sale of assets, for the fourth quarter.
Halliburton said the charge relates to the sale of its seismic-related business to Western Atlas International Inc., the oilfield subsidiary of Litton Industries Inc.
Halliburton, an energy-services company, said the charge involves costs associated with the sale, such as increased expenses for severance of employees, termination of contracts, revaluation of assets and expected losses on some existing contracts.
In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Halliburton had a net loss of $178.2 million, or $1.66 a share, after restructuring charges of $185.8 million.
Revenue was $1.69 billion.
The company also said it completed the sale of its seismic business to Western Atlas for $190 million in cash and senior notes.
