Pacific Telesis Group said its PacTel Cellular unit will invest nearly $250 million over five years to build a digital wireless network in California and Georgia.
PacTel said the network will incorporate the code division multiple access system, or CDMA, one of two main competing digital standards being adopted in the U.S.
A host of companies, including several Baby Bells, have made verbal commitments to back CDMA.
CDMA systems assign a special electronic code to each call signal, allowing more calls to occupy the same space and be spread over an entire frequency band.
As a result, the call-handling capacity is boosted by 20 times, compared with conventional analog cellular systems.
Other companies such as McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., however, are spending millions to build a competing digital system, known as Time Division Multiple Access, or TDMA.
This technology places each call signal into a time slot and transmits it within a single frequency.
"TDMA is here today, and has been since last March," a McCaw spokesman said.
Jeffrey Hines, a PaineWebber analyst, says it is too early to tell which of the competing technologies is superior.
But because the incompatible technologies are already starting to be deployed, "the customer is going to lose out in the end."
Various features on a TDMA digital phone, for instance, can't always be used in a region where a CDMA system has been deployed, and vice versa.
