Chrysler Corp. will offer for the first time lower-priced leases on its bread-and-butter LH midsize sedans, and it began discounting minivans by as much as $2,600 to pre-empt Ford Motor Co.'s forthcoming Windstar van.
Chrysler officials said they decided to begin offering more aggressively priced leases on the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision LH sedans to respond to growing demand for lease deals in the midpriced market.
Ford, General Motors Corp. and Japanese auto makers are heavily promoting low-payment leases to boost sales.
Chrysler also has hefty supplies of unsold Concordes and Visions that a lower-priced lease could help clear out.
But according to newsletter Ward's Automotive Report, Chrysler had a 62-day supply of unsold Intrepids as of Dec. 31, well within the 60-to-65-day supply range auto makers consider ideal.
Chrysler's decision to step up minivan discounts, largely in the form of lower prices for option packages, replays a strategy the No. 3 U.S. auto maker has used before to hammer challengers to its leadership in the minivan market.
By cutting its minivans' prices and advertising a "National Minivan Sale" that ends May 31, Chrysler hopes to siphon away customers who might buy the new Windstar when it goes on sale March 24.
"It's not unexpected," a Ford spokesman said.
"It gives us an opportunity to see what Chrysler's plans are."
