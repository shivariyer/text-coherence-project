Donald W. Freeman unexpectedly resigned yesterday afternoon as chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr. Freeman, 32 years old, who held the title of chairman, assumed the chief executive's duties Wednesday, after the Holland, Mich., maker of recycled polyester products dismissed CEO Curtis Appel and its vice president of investor relations, Joel Ramey.
