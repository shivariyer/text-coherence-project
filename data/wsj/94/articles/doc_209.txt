Clayton Williams Energy Inc.'s 1993 fourth-quarter results swung to a loss from a profit because of the oil-price slide, Chairman Clayton Williams Jr. said.
Earnings for the Midland, Texas, oil and gas producing company won't be officially released until next week.
But Mr. Williams, in an interview, said the concern is showing a fourth-quarter loss of $2.6 million, or 46 cents a share, against a year-earlier quarterly profit of $1 million, or 33 cents a share.
Revenue for the fourth quarter is pegged at $14.1 million, compared with $18.6 million during the 1992 quarter.
Earnings reflect the addition of 2.5 million shares in Clayton's initial public offering.
Mr. Williams said the sharp drop in oil prices during the last half of the year caused the loss.
The drilling of two unsuccessful wells during the fourth quarter contributed to the negative numbers as well.
