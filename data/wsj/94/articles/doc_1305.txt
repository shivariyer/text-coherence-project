AgriDyne Technologies Inc. said the U.S. Patent office approved patents related to the company's use of neem seed for making bioinsecticide.
Neem trees grow in India, Africa and other equatorial areas.
The patents cover AgriDyne's two main products, Azatin and Terplex insecticides, and Align, an insecticide it expects to ship late this year.
