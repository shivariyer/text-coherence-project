Flight International Group Inc. said it and three of its subsidiaries have filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
The aviation-services company said it has "reached consensus in principle" with the majority of its institutional lenders for a debt restructuring.
It also said it expects to emerge from reorganization as a profitable company.
Company officials couldn't be reached for further details.
The company's stock was delisted by the Nasdaq Stock Market several years ago.
