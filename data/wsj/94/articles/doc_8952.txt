Reluctant to rock the boat on a slow trading day, investors continued their buying trend, pushing small-company stocks slightly higher to another record.
The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks the performance of small-capitalization issues traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market and the major exchanges, gained 0.62 point, or 0.24%, to end at 261.89, its fourth consecutive record.
The Nasdaq Composite Index just missed its third straight closing high, slipping 0.13 point to 792.18.
However it traded in record territory just before the close.
Traders said the combination of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, the East Coast storm and a closed bond market caused many market players to stay home or refrain from making large moves.
In addition, the California earthquake shut down some Los Angeles brokerage operations and damped spirit at others across the country.
Some immediate beneficiaries of the California earthquake appear to be construction issues, as investors predicted that the group could profit when cleanup of the disaster begins.
Among those moving higher on the New York Stock Exchange were Kasler Holding, a Highland, Calif., builder of public works, up 1 7/8 to 10, and Calmat, a Los Angeles producer of construction materials, up 2 3/8 to 24 1/8.
Granite Construction, a Watsonville, Calif., contractor for public infrastructure projects, rose 2 1/2 to 24 3/4.
Nasdaq decliners ran ahead of advancers, 1,462 to 1,424, on Nasdaq National Market volume of 203 million shares, down from Friday's 254.2 million.
Overall volume slipped to 243.5 million shares down from 299.7 million on Friday.
Despite today's bounce on thin volume, optimism runs high that smaller stocks can continue their streak.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through Friday's record to gain 3.09, or 0.08%, to 3,870.29.
