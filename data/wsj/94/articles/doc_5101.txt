The Clinton administration suspended its formal investigation of Indonesia's worker-rights policies for six months, saying the move will enable the country to enact recently adopted labor regulations.
The action, at least for now, will ease political tensions between Washington and Jakarta over the issue of worker rights, which is a main condition for U.S. extension of duty-free status for Indonesia under the Generalized System of Preferences.
The GSP is a program designed to boost developing countries' exports to the U.S.
The improved relations also give the Clinton administration an important ally in Asia as trade tensions increase between the U.S. and Japan.
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who has primary responsibility for preference system reviews, cautioned that despite the move to halt intensive review, "more needs to be done" by Indonesia to address U.S. concerns.
The U.S. is concerned about Jakarta's strong hand in labor contract negotiations.
Mr. Kantor said the U.S. isn't yet prepared to formally end its investigation of Indonesia's duty-free status eligibility.
But he said that in six months, his office will review the issue.
The review will come a few months before President Clinton's scheduled visit to Indonesia for the annual year-end summit of leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
The U.S. also announced yesterday that Kazakhstan and Romania have been granted duty-free status.
