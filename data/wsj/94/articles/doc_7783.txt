Despite a continuing downturn in Japan's economy, Kao Corp., Japan's leading maker of personal-care products, expects a record pretax profit for the current fiscal year.
The company's continuing cost-cutting efforts and recent sales volume gives Kao confidence it will meet its forecast pretax profits of 46 billion yen ($414 million) on expected sales of 640 billion yen for the year ending March 31, said Tomiaki Nagase, Kao's senior managing director.
The company said the profit outlook is boosted primarily by such "rationalization" moves as reducing inventory and streamlining sales and distribution.
In particular, Kao cites efficiencies gained from a new computer system linking retailers directly with sales and marketing people in Kao's head office.
Pretax profit "is in a better position than sales," he said, but added that "sales are also running almost as we expected."
If the projected pretax profit is realized as anticipated, it will be the 13th consecutive year of record profit.
