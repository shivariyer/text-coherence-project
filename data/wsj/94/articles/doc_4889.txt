Your "Frosty Muggs" page-one article on Jan. 17 about Lillehammer, Norway's lack of a sunny disposition is unfortunately based on a misunderstanding of a Lillehamringer's use of a smile.
It may surprise you, but a greeting with a smile could be taken as an insult or even a ridicule, and definitely not as a friendly greeting.
A friendly and polite greeting is an indication of respect, and, for gentlemen, includes a serious bow and the lifting of a hat or cap to indicate the high esteem held for the person being greeted.
There is no lack of smiles once the greeting is over, and you will find a good sense of humor and smiles among the people.
Their ways may be too formal today.
However, it may be difficult at first for them to get used to the American greeting with the friendly smile.

Gudbrandsdalen means Gudbrands valley, named after a wealthy and powerful noble, Gudbrand, who lived there early in the second millennium.
