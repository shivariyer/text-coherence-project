Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it is slashing prices on several flash memory chips by as much as 34% in an effort to lure customers away from a competing technology sold by archrival Intel Corp.
Flash chips, which hold data when the electrical current is turned off, are one of the fastest-growing segments of the chip business.
AMD will cut the price of flash chips that store four megabits of data.
The chips previously came in versions priced at $20 to $25 and will now be priced between $15 and $17.
That's about half the price of an Intel eight-megabit chip; for the same price, two AMD chips would store the same amount of data.
The AMD prices will fall to less than $10 by the fourth quarter, keeping pace with Intel's planned price reductions.
Intel's chips require 12 volts of electrical current to program, compared with five volts for AMD's chips.
The lower voltage -- an asset in applications such as portable computers, where power consumption is a key issue -- had previously commanded a price premium.
Walt Lahti, a vice president at the Scottsdale, Ariz., research firm In-Stat Inc., estimates that Intel's flash sales grew 80% to $372 million in 1993.
Sales of second-place AMD surged fivefold to $232 million, he said.
Flash chips have been hampered by incompatible designs that make it difficult to use different suppliers' chips interchangeably.
Steve Grossman, an AMD marketing manager, said its pricing is designed to help make its five-volt technology into an industry standard.
AMD also will cut the price of a one-megabit flash chip, operating at a speed of 90 nanoseconds, by 34% to $6.75 each.
Another version, operating at 120 nanoseconds, will be cut 17% to $6.50, the company said.
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, AMD closed at $21.75, unchanged.
