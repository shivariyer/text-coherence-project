A federal-court judge ruled yesterday that General Motors Corp. must restore retiree health-care benefits that were reduced or eliminated in the 1980s.
The ruling by Judge John Feikens in U.S. District Court affects some 45,000 retirees.
A GM spokesman said the company was considering an appeal and that it was "premature to speculate" about the possible costs of the ruling.
"We believe we do have the right to ammend, modify or change our benefits plan," Richard F. O'Brien, GM's vice president of corporate personnel, said in a prepared statement.
Mr. O'Brien called GM benefits "among the best in all of industry."
The suit charged that the Detroit company breached contractual obligations to provide lifetime health benefits to retirees.
GM stock rose 50 cents, or 0.8%, to close at $61.50 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
