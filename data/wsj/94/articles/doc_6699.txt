A shareholder lawsuit that Spectrum Information Technologies Inc. had agreed to settle is being expanded after new disclosures of insider sales and a federal investigation of the wireless-technology company.
Spectrum is under scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission because of upbeat statements it made about the value of its patents.
In November, Spectrum said it had agreed to settle a related class-action shareholder lawsuit for $1.5 million and new warrants, pending final terms.
John Sculley, Spectrum's new chief executive, had made settling the litigation a top priority when he joined the company in October.
Company executives have since cited the settlement as a sign that the company is putting its problems behind it.
But the lawyer for shareholder plaintiffs yesterday said the two sides haven't settled anything.
"In light of what has been occurring over the last several weeks, our discovery in this case is being broadened substantially," the attorney, Daniel Krasner, said.
Mr. Krasner said the settlement agreement was never presented to the court and the complaint now will be expanded in light of recent disclosures about Spectrum.
These include the sale of stock by company President Peter Caserta and other insiders after the hiring of Mr. Sculley sent shares rising strongly, the disclosure of the SEC investigation, and the dismissal of Arthur Andersen & Co. as Spectrum's auditor after the accounting firm found problems with internal controls.
Officials of Spectrum, which is based in Manhasset, N.Y., couldn't be reached for comment.
The shareholder suits, later consolidated into a class-action complaint in federal court in New York, were filed after the wild ride taken by Spectrum's stock last spring when American Telephone & Telegraph Co. disavowed a boast from Mr. Caserta that the deal would be worth "hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties."
Spectrum shares fell 12.5 cents, or 2%, to $6.0625 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday.
