It is understandable that some career prosecutors see prosecution as the prime instrument of crime control ("Attorney General of Social Work," by Alicia Mundy, editorial page, Jan. 5), but the person at the top needs a little extra vision to examine the entire system to see whether it's working the best it can.
Individual prosecutors might enjoy the "leverage" that mandatory minimums give them to make sweet deals with drug dealers who name their suppliers, but Attorney General Janet Reno is right to be concerned that the dealers and suppliers often end up getting lighter punishments than small-time first offenders who have no information to bargain with, and that nonviolent first offenders are getting tougher sentences than most people convicted of murder and rape.
Twelve years of such nonsense has left us with a 45% increase in violent crime and a constantly increasing portion of nonviolent offenders taking up costly prison space while the most vicious predators are paroled early.
Three-out-of-five inmates today are doing time for nonviolent offenses; one-out-of-10 is locked up for drug possession (according to Justice Department figures).
Resistance to change is a hallmark of career bureaucrats, but hardly a reason to block genuine improvements that might make the streets safer and the justice system more rational.
