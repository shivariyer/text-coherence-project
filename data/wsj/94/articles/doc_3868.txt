Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Japan Tobacco Inc. conditionally agreed to double its maximum investment in research to more than $56 million, allowing Agouron to expand antiviral-drug study.
Japan Tobacco will pay $7 million upfront.
Thereafter, the partner will make antiviral-program payments of at least $8 million over two years, or of more than $21 million over four years if two certain preclinical research milestones are met.
Separately, Agouron said it this week will reveal the structure of the rhinovirus 3C protease -- an enzyme critical in the replication cycle of viruses responsible for the common cold.
The Japan Tobacco pact is to design compounds to inactivate protease enzymes required for replication of hepatitis C, herpes and the rhinoviruses responsible for upper-respiratory infection.
Agouron has received $9.8 million of a potential $28 million from a 1992 drug-research pact in which the Japanese company acquired a 2% stake in Agouron.
