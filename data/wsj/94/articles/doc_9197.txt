Chrysler Corp. said it is considering increasing production capacity of its pickup trucks because of growing demand for several redesigned models.
Until now, Chrysler has been relying heavily on overtime to meet demand for such hot-selling models as the Dodge Ram and Dakota pickups and Cherokee sport utility vehicles.
The auto maker said it is "still studying options."
In the meantime, Chrysler said it scheduled overtime tomorrow and next week at its assembly plant in Detroit that makes the Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle.
Separately, Chrysler said it has received 57,000 orders so far for its new Neon subcompact automobile.
It will take until early March to fill the backlog of orders, Chrysler said.
Chrysler, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. all planned overtime this week and next week at several U.S. and Canadian assembly plants.
Auto plants will be closed Monday in observance of the Martin Luther King holiday.
The domestic auto makers said they planned to build 225,507 cars and trucks this week, up 32% from the 170,733 vehicles built in the same week a year earlier.
