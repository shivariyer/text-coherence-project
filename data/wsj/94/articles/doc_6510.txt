Herman's Sporting Goods Inc. and its official unsecured creditors' committee said they agreed on a reorganization plan for the company.
The plan is expected to provide unsecured creditors with cash and equity that will exceed 90 cents on the dollar for their claims.
The agreement is subject to review by the committee's investment bankers.
The Carteret, N.J., retailer said it intends to file the reorganization plan with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey shortly and expects to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection by mid-1994.
Herman's operations, as well as its secured debt, were purchased by a U.S.based investor group in March, and the company filed for bankruptcy-code protection soon after.
Herman's currently has about 98 stores in the Northeast corridor, down from 253 stores at acquisition.
A Herman's official said the existing operation is expected to generate $340 million to $350 million in sales in the fiscal year, which started Tuesday.
