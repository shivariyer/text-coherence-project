Marubeni Corp., one of Japan's six largest general trading houses, announced that it cut its forecast for unconsolidated profit for the year ending March 31, to around seven billion yen ($64.4 million).
The company said the revision is a result of extraordinary losses stemming in part from liquidation of its unprofitable financial unit, Marubeni Leasing Corp.
The forecast was cut 46% from 13 billion yen, and would represent a 36% drop from the 10.92 billion yen profit the company posted last fiscal year.
Sluggishness in Japan's stock market led to substantial losses in the specified money trusts and fund trusts managed by Marubeni Leasing.
