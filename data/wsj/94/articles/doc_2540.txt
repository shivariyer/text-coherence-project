Texas insurance regulators have asked Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. to refund premiums to as many as 100,000 life insurance policyholders unless the company can prove they weren't defrauded.
Under a multistate agreement announced last week to settle charges of fraudulent sales practices, Met agreed to refund premiums to 60,000 policyholders nationwide.
Under the formula used to calculate the number of eligible policyholders in each state, only 3,000 Texas residents qualified.
Texas Insurance Commissioner Robert Hunter said as many as 97,000 more policyholders in Texas -- almost every individual who bought a whole-life insurance policy from Met between 1988 and 1993 -- might have been defrauded.
"I've asked Met to provide proof that the remaining 97,000 were not misled," Mr. Hunter said.
"We will continue working with the department in the hopes of arriving at a speedy resolution of the issue," said a Met spokesman.
"We've already pledged that not one of our policyholders will be hurt financially because of this situation."
About 30 states have agreed to the multistate resolution to settle the charges against Met.
Texas is the largest holdout.
