Germany's Federal Cartel Office ordered Fried Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp to sell the automobile-suspension operations of its Krupp Brueninghaus subsidiary.
If the German diversified steel and industrial group doesn't comply with the order, the cartel office said it will ask an independent auditor to sell the unit.
The Krupp and Hoesch firms were allowed to merge in April 1992 on the condition that the unit be sold by Dec. 31, 1993.
But the combined company gave notice at the end of 1993 that it wouldn't stick to the contract because market conditions had worsened.
The cartel office has said it wouldn't accept this reason because conditions had worsened across the industry.
The firm said it would fight the order in court.
