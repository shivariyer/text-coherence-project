W. Daniel Barker, 67 years old, was named to the board of this contract anesthesia-service provider.
Mr. Barker, a health-care consultant and professor emeritus of community health at Emory University School of Medicine, fills one of two empty board slots created when two executives left in January: Terry Vitez, 50, executive vice president of medical affairs, and Richard Ballard, 45, president, left the company and their board seats in a restructuring.
