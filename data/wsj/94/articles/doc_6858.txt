Georgia-Pacific Corp. said it will spend $1.6 billion during the next two years to upgrade and enhance its wood-products, pulp and paper operations.
The Atlanta forest-products company said it plans to invest most of the money in its wood-products businesses.
About $900 million will be spent this year, with the funds coming from operations and asset sales.
In 1993, capital spending totaled $467 million.
Analysts generally applauded the news, saying now is an ideal time for the company to make more capital investments.
"With the timber shortage in the Pacific Northwest, there are opportunities for companies like Georgia-Pacific, with a large Southern base, to pick up some of the slack and do it profitably," said Chip Dillon of Salomon Brothers.
