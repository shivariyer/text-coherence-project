Amax Gold Inc. said it received a commitment for a $100 million line of credit from Cyprus Amax Minerals Corp.
A portion will be used to pay existing debt guaranteed by Cyprus Amax.
In addition, Cyprus Amax will purchase three million Amax Gold common shares at $6.888 each to repay about $20.7 million of Amax Gold debt to Cyprus Amax, raising Cyprus Amax's share of the gold company to 42% from 40%.
Amax Gold can pay back any money borrowed on the credit line in Amax Gold convertible, preferred stock.
The conversion to common stock would increase Cyprus Amax's stake to just under 50%.
