The U.S. and Japanese governments have agreed to resume stalled negotiations over reaching a new trade "framework" in Washington on Monday, a senior Japanese government official said.
The two countries are trying to reach an agreement on increasing foreign access to Japanese markets -- in autos and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement -- by the time Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets in Washington with President Clinton next Friday.
The two countries decided to restart the talks between high-level negotiators after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor spent the week in Tokyo meeting with top Japanese politicians and making veiled threats of sanctions if an agreement isn't reached.
The senior Japanese government official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said that Japanese leaders told Mr. Kantor this week that Japan is adhering to its refusal to accept numerical targets.
