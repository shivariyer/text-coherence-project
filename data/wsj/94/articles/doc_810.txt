Carolco Pictures Inc. and Live Entertainment Inc. said they agreed in principal to merge through an exchange of common stock.
It is the second time the two entertainment companies, which are related, have agreed to combine.
The companies said that, under the current proposed agreement, Carolco holders will receive one share of newly issued Live common stock for each 5.5 shares of Carolco stock currently held.
The ratio may be adjusted under certain conditions.
The exchange would result in Live shareholders owning between 22% and 29% of the continuing corporation, which would be called Carolco Entertainment Inc. and would be headed by Mario Kassar, chairman of Carolco.
The transaction is subject to a number of conditions.
Carolco and Live said they plan to sign a final agreement within 30 days.
Carolco, based in Los Angeles, is a producer of various big-budget movies, including "Terminator," and more recently, "Basic Instinct."
Live is a home-video concern with distribution and retailing interests.
The two companies previously proposed a merger in 1991, when Carolco held more than a 50% stake in Live.
Those plans were called off as financial conditions deteriorated at both companies.
Carolco last October averted threatened bankruptcy-law reorganization by completing a financial restructuring that included about $112.5 million in new capital.
Before restructuring, Carolco held a 36.7% stake in Live.
However, much of that stake was distributed to creditors.
