A federal judge ordered Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Massachusetts Inc. to pay an estimated $9 million to nearly 500 former employees whose jobs were transferred to Electronic Data Systems Corp. in 1992.
The employees filed a class-action suit.
The suit contended that even though the workers were offered jobs with EDS, they were entitled to severance benefits from Blue Cross, the largest health-service provider in the state.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert E. Keeton ruled that 480 former Blue Cross employees should get what they would have received under their former employer's severance plan, plus interest accrued after their jobs were transferred.
The ruling, which was released yesterday, doesn't affect Dallas-based EDS, a unit of General Motors Corp.
A Blue Cross attorney termed the payments an undeserved "windfall" and vowed an appeal.
