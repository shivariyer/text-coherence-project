Move over, Michael Jordan.
Former Texas Tech University basketball star Sheryl Swoopes, who wowed Texas fans with her speed and shooting touch, has landed on the pages of Vanity Fair magazine in a big-time endorsement deal for athletic-shoe giant Nike Inc.
And in signing the contract, Ms. Swoopes, named last week the Associated Press's female athlete of 1993, has reached another milestone.
She is the first female basketball player ever to be featured in a Nike ad campaign-no small achievement in a sport that usually abandons women players after college.
"I think five, 10 years from now," Ms. Swoopes says from her home in Lubbock, "people are going to look back on it and say, `Out of college, she signed with Nike.
If I work hard, and if I'm good enough, maybe something will happen for me.'"
Though Nike officials won't disclose details of the contract, a representative for Ms. Swoopes says it extends through the 1996 Summer Olympics.
Nike officials say Ms. Swoopes is part of an ad campaign aimed at women.
In a two-page ad in the February issue of Vanity Fair, she tells readers about working out twice a day, playing basketball with her brothers and becoming a "black, female role model for younger kids."
Now the 6-foot-tall 22-year-old, who led her team to the national title last year, is finishing the last few hours of a sports science degree at Texas Tech.
She still works out with the school's basketball team to stay in shape for 1996.
And she is an announcer on radio broadcasts of the team's games.
Though she stays busy, Ms. Swoopes is frustrated by the limited postgraduate opportunities in women's basketball.
She played for three months last year for an Italian women's team, but says she left after it failed to make good on all its promises.
"There's nothing to do unless you go overseas and play," Ms. Swoopes laments.
"I love to play.
I just don't want to have to do it overseas."
