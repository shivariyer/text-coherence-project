Toronto Sun Publishing Corp. wrote down by 46.6 million Canadian dollars ($35.5 million) the value of assets it purchased in several costly forays into the U.S. newspaper business.
After the write-down and a C$6.1 million provision for staff-reduction programs, the Toronto newspaper publisher reported a fourth-quarter loss of C$49.4 million, or C$2.07 a share.
A year earlier it had profit of C$723,000, or three Canadian cents a share.
Toronto Sun is 62%-owned by Maclean Hunter Ltd., a Toronto publishing and broadcasting concern.
Paul Godfrey, president and chief executive officer of Toronto Sun, said the company wrote down the entire C$28.9 million carrying value of securities related to its former ownership of the Houston Post newspaper.
He said the company still expects to recover the money eventually, but decided to treat the asset more conservatively.
