Western European car sales rose a meager 1.9% in February, reflecting continued weakness in the overall Western European economy.
Sales in 19 Western European countries rose to 936,060 vehicles from 918,610 units in February 1993, according to preliminary figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, or ACEA.
In the first two months of the year, sales rose 4.2% from a year earlier.
February's lackluster month-to-month growth, which was down from the 7.1% increase in January, is more worrying since February 1993 sales were exceptionally weak, a spokesman for the ACEA said.
Year-earlier sales were depressed because consumers rushed to buy cars in December 1992 to take advantage of tax breaks offered by several European governments.
These days only France provides any sort of tax break: Auto owners who ditch their old car to buy a new one get a 5,000 French franc ($855.35) check from the government.
The measure, which was part of a demand-boosting package unveiled by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last month, has had a substantial impact: With the two national makers Renault SA and PSA Peugeot Citroen SA matching the government with 5,000 franc rebates, French auto registrations increased 8.2% last month, making France one of the more robust European car markets.
But sales in Italy and Germany remained "very weak," an ACEA spokesman said.
Registrations plunged 16% in Italy, while they were up a bare 0.5% in Germany.
Arthur Maher, an analyst at DRI Europe in London, said the data show consumer confidence remains shaky as European economies slowly pull out of recession.
"To get the auto market in a durable recovery you need a situation where people don't feel threatened by unemployment.
For that, you need an economic recovery," Mr. Maher said.
