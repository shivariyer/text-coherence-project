Salant Corp. said it withdrew plans to sell its Obion Denton children's sleepwear division due to the unit's improving performance.
The New York apparel company had declared its intention to sell the unit in March 1993 as part of a restructuring effort.
But a company spokesman said the unit had become profitable recently, and its prospects were improving.
"We made some radical changes in our operations," said Richard P. Randall, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
"We closed some facilities and moved some manufacturing south of the border, into Mexico."
Obion Denton represents about 10% of Salant's more than $400 million in annual sales, the company said.
Salant said it had some "heavy negotiations" with potential buyers, but the company decided it could get stronger returns by keeping the unit.
Salant, which makes apparel under the Perry Ellis and John Henry brand names, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last Sept. 20.
