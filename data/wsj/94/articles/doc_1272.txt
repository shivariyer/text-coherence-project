National Westminster Bank PLC, one of Britain's largest commercial banks, said it plans to pay $500 million to acquire Citizens First Bancorp., a 50-branch New Jersey bank.
The purchase will expand the market share of NatWest's U.S. banking subsidiary, NatWest Bancorp, in certain affluent areas of New Jersey.
Citizens First, with headquarters in Glen Rock, N.J., employs 880 people and has net assets of about $2.6 billion.
Under the agreement, subject to certain approvals, NatWest will pay Citizens shareholders $9.75 a share or exchange 0.22034 NatWest American Depositary Receipt for each Citizens First share.
The company said that between 50% and 60% of the Citizens First shareholders will receive ADRs, taking into account shareholder preference.
One ADR represents six ordinary shares of NatWest's parent company.
NatWest plans to merge Citizens First with National Westminster Bank NJ, a unit of NatWest Bancorp.
After the merger, NatWest Bancorp will have assets of about $26 billion and a network of 183 branches in New Jersey and 127 in New York City, Long Island and Westchester County, N.Y.
Allan D. Nichols, Citizens First chairman, stands to profit handsomely from the acquisition.
According to the company's 1993 proxy, he holds options on 347,222 Citizens First shares, exercisable at $3.60 a share.
Based on the $9.75-a-share offering price, Mr. Nichols's options have an underlying value of about $2.1 million.
The options, according to last year's proxy, would become immediately vested upon completion of any agreement.
Mr. Nichols says he has exercised 20,000 options.
And if his employment contract is terminated following the deal, Mr. Nichols would receive a bonus equal to his salary, $430,000, and would also be paid for the entirety of his current contract, which expires Feb. 26, 1995.
Mr. Nichols, 56 years old, said he expects his contract to be terminated following the acquisition.
