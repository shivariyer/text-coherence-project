Imagine my surprise to find a quote from my story about growing up on welfare in your Jan. 6 lead editorial "The Road Not Taken."
It was especially surprising to see the quote used to buttress an argument with which I am in complete disagreement.
My father walked out many back doors to insure our well-being; key to that well-being was the health insurance than any family with children knows is vital.
Our being on welfare was the only way for my parents to be sure that their four children could see a doctor when we needed one -- and for several years, we needed one quite a few times.
My father's painful choice is replicated by hundreds of thousands of poor women and men who put the survival of their children ahead of their personal relationships.
President Clinton's focus on health-care reform that includes universal, irrevocable coverage will make a major difference to families -- on welfare or not.
Health care that can be depended on will make it a lot easier for women on welfare to go to work -- even if that work is the dead-end, minimum-wage work they have been offered before.
