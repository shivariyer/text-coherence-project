Venezuela said it would drop a challenge to a U.S. clean-air regulation after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed to modify the rule, the EPA said.
The rule, intended to reduce smog-producing chemicals, would require Venezuela to impose costly controls on gasoline it ships to the U.S.
It was issued in final form in December, but Venezuela challenged it under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The Venezuelans said the rule discriminated against foreign oil suppliers by imposing a different formula on them than on domestic U.S. producers.
U.S. officials concluded the rule, as written, probably would violate GATT.
Under the agreement, the EPA said it would amend the rule so Venezuela's obligations are calculated in a way similar to that of domestic producers.
The agency said it would ask for public comment on its proposal.
The environmental agency said the GATT challenge, if successful, could have required the U.S. to alter the clean-air regulation more fundamentally.
