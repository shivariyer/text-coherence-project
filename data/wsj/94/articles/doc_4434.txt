SA Holdings Inc. said it received an exclusive authorization and license from the Russian government to publish and distribute reference books on Russian Parliament membership, other governmental membership and executive-branch committees.
The company said the information will be published in Russian and English reference books and distributed primarily to governmental offices, universities and law firms around the world.
SA Holdings, through its Baltic States and CIS Ventures unit, will publish and distribute the books and will "participate with certain Russian governmental agencies" in royalties generated by the sales.
