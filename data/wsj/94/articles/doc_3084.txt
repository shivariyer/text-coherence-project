The Clinton administration said it reached "preliminary understandings" with the French government by which France will relax strict controls on its imports of U.S. fish.
A dispute has simmered between the two countries since Feb. 5, when the French government said it would run lengthy tests on fresh fish from outside the European Union.
The action resulted in shipments of U.S. fish rotting in containers at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.
Last year, the U.S. exported $82 million in frozen fish to France.
Resolution of the dispute would avert punitive actions the U.S. has been considering -- including the possibility of blocking imports of French products such as cheese.
Rufus Yerxa, deputy U.S. trade representative, told reporters that starting today, the French will reopen Charles de Gaulle Airport to fish and animal products, and resume its old practice of conducting only spot inspections of shipments from sources that don't have a history of problems.
Mr. Yerxa said the French told U.S. officials the "sole" reason for the increased inspections was health concerns.
He quipped: "I just said that for the halibut."
U.S. officials said they plan to make a final decision by "the latter part" of this week.
