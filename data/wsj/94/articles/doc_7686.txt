Firmer financial issues, spurred on by strong bonds, helped to lift small-company stocks from the lower levels of the past two sessions.
The Russell 2000 Index, which measures the performance of small-capitalization issues traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market and the major exchanges, rose 0.79, or 0.30%, to 262.84.
Monday and Tuesday, the index lost 1.75, or 0.66%, after posting a closing record Friday.
The Treasury's 30-year bond ended up nearly 1/2 point, boosting interest-rate-sensitive stocks.
Wainwright Bank & Trust, Boston, jumped 1 to 4 1/4; Selective Insurance Group, Branchville, N.J., added 1 1/4 to 29 1/4; and Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin, Madison, Wis., rose 7/8 to 24 after posting improved fiscal third-quarter earnings.
Baltimore-based investment firm Alex. Brown (NYSE) closed up 1/2 at 25 5/8 following strong fourth-quarter and full-year results announced after the close of trading.
The company reported fourth-quarter net of $2.42 a share, up from $1.37 a year earlier.
For the year, net was $5.61 a share, up from $3.72 in 1992.
Transportation stocks also were strong, with truckers faring particularly well.
Consolidated Freightways (NYSE), Palo Alto, Calif., edged up 1/8 to 25 3/8; Yellow Corp., Overland Park, Kan., added 1/2 to 27 1/8; and Memphis, Tenn.-based M.S. Carriers moved 1 1/4 higher to 24 3/4.
Another group filled with standouts was the communications sector.
Jones Spacelink, Englewood, Colo., rose 3/8 to 2 5/8, and American Business Information, Omaha, Neb., jumped 2 to 17.
In a "brand name" initial public offering, Playtex Products Inc. was priced after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $13 a share, or the low end of its proposed $13 to $15 range, through lead underwriter Merrill Lynch.
Playtex makes tampons and infant-care products.
The 20 million-share offering, co-managed by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney Shearson, comes as the company "is beginning to see a turnaround in its results," says Linda Killian, a principal in Renaissance Capital, a Greenwich, Conn., institutional research firm that specializes in IPOs.
The IPO is a "play on the Playtex brand, yet brand names have come under a lot of pressure," she said, noting that the issue is not one of a small handful of new issues that Renaissance has felt comfortable recommending as a buy this year.
On the earnings front, Three-Five Systems (Amex), a Phoenix opto-electronic-products company, surged 7 to 43 1/2.
The company said its fourth-quarter earnings rose to 51 cents a share from 12 cents a year earlier.
QuickResponse Services, a Richmond, Calif., provider of data and network services, jumped 2 to 22 1/2.
Late Tuesday, the company said fourth-quarter earnings climbed to 14 cents a share from one cent a year earlier.
Starter (NYSE) tumbled 3 1/4 to 12 1/4.
The sportswear maker, based in New Haven, Conn., said after the close Tuesday that it expects fourth-quarter net of six cents to nine cents a share, compared with pro forma earnings of 14 cents a year earlier.
Merrill Lynch & Co. cut Starter to near-term "neutral" from "above average."
Butler Manufacturing, a Kansas City, Mo., maker of pre-engineered building systems, fell 2 3/4 to 25 1/4.
The company said its fourth-quarter operating profit rose to 43 cents a share from 35 cents a year earlier.
Butler expects its first-quarter loss to widen from the 27 cents reported a year earlier.
Also, Butler said the sale of its Walker division will be somewhat dilutive in the near term.
Though the sale will benefit the company by reducing interest expense, the overall effect will be to lower 1994 earnings by 38 cents a share.
A First Albany downgrade to "neutral" from "buy" pushed Medusa (NYSE) down 2 3/4 to 31 3/4.
The brokerage firm said it cut the rating based on the price of the Cleveland Heights, Ohio, cement company's stock.
News that Cobra Industries (NYSE) got an order for 300 of its Park model recreational vehicles, which retail for $18,500 to $22,000, lifted the Gosben, Ind., company's stock 1 to 8 1/2.
Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, Calif., zoomed 1 1/4 higher to 10 1/2.
The company said it received word from the European Patent Office that it plans to grant the company a fundamental patent covering the DNA molecule and methods for recombinant production of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein.
The protein may have therapeutic value to treat life-threatening conditions such as adult respiratory-distress syndrome, hemorrhagic shock and fatal complications of infection, burns and trauma.
William Haneman, senior vice president of Nasdaq over-the-counter trading at Legg Mason Wood Walker, said, "Financial stocks are holding up nicely also because they've had some good earnings without any major surprises."
Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin, for example, posted third-quarter earnings of 72 cents a share, above analysts' estimates of 70 cents.
In the year-earlier quarter, the company had net income of 56 cents.
But yesterday's move higher wasn't confined to the rate-sensitive group.
Larry Kinney, head of over-the-counter trading at SoundView, said the bond rally, continued optimism over the earnings flow and a bounceback from Tuesday all played a role in the advance.
The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 2.41, or 0.31%, to end at 788.80 after losing a total of 7.88, or 0.99%, in the past two days following Friday's record-setting session.
