Best Products Co. said sales for February rose 12% to $88.6 million from $79 million, while sales at stores open at least a year also rose 12%.
The company, a catalog showroom retailer operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection, said its operations in 22 states were diverse enough to offset weather-related weaknesses in some markets.
Results were also "well balanced between jewelry and hard lines," Best said.
