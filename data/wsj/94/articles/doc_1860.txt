An obvious problem for economic growth in the next two years is that a sustained decline in the personal saving rate as a means of financing higher consumption seems unlikely.
Nineteen ninety-three tax legislation is going to affect household cash flow for the first time this year.
This tax increase is likely to lower the saving rate still further, all else equal.
Where this fall in saving would come from on the household balance sheet is certainly an area of pure conjecture, but the magnitude of the adjustment involved is troubling. . . .
We must realize that the situation in the household sector is far less positive than it was during the 1980s.
Not only is personal saving at a record low, but households are less liquid than at any time in memory.
