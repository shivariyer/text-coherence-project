A Textron Inc. automotive parts maker faces financial liability for a faulty fuel-pipe assembly that it supplied to General Motors Corp., according to people familiar with a recall announced last week.
GM recalled 53,000 new S-10 pickup trucks, and expects to make the change on 67,000 unsold vehicles, saying that the faulty parts didn't meet federal standards for fuel leakage in a collision.
GM wouldn't name the supplier of the part, and Textron, in Providence, R.I., didn't return calls yesterday.
But a person familiar with the situation said the supplier was a Cincinnati-based Textron unit, Randall Textron.
The unit was also named as the supplier in the current issue of the Automotive News trade weekly.
A GM spokeswoman said the unidentified supplier "has stepped up to it, and acknowledged its responsibility."
She said that the company has otherwise "been a quality supplier to us for many years."
