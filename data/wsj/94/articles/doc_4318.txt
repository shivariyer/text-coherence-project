National Westminster Bank PLC announced a more than twofold increase in 1993 pretax profit -- and was rewarded with a 5.4% drop in its share price.
Despite the overall improvement in earnings, which was in line with market predictions, analysts voiced concern about a decline in the British concern's net interest income during 1993 and expectations of continuing weak demand for loans in 1994.
Shares fell to 504 pence ($7.46) from 533 pence on the London Stock Exchange.
NatWest said pretax profit rose to #989 million ($1.46 billion) from #367 million.
But the increase mainly reflected a #537 million fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts to #1.26 billion.
Net interest income -- the difference between money earned on loans and interest-bearing investments, on the one hand, and money paid to depositors, on the other -- dropped 1.6% in 1993 to #3.7 billion, and analysts forecast a further fall of around 2% in 1994.
