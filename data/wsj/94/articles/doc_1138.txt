Landing on newsstands this week is Crayola Kids, a new magazine that is a joint venture between publisher Meredith Corp. and crayonmaker Binney & Smith Inc.
Already, over 30 magazines aim at children between the ages of three and eight, but the publishers of this one say its focus on reading and creative projects is unusual.
Custom magazines are on the rise.
Unlike most others, however, Crayola Kids doesn't include among its ads a single pitch for its crayons.
Nor does it tout them in articles.
The magazine does include activities involving crayons, but it doesn't suggest using the Crayola brand.
"We intend to operate this at the highest standard of consumer journalism," said John Loughlin, head of custom publishing for Meredith, in Des Moines, Iowa.
Mr. Loughlin said the partners promised advertisers a circulation of 250,000, starting with this first bimonthly issue.
Subscriptions are being offered for about $15, and a massive direct-mail campaign is under way.
Mr. Loughlin said Crayola Kids will be advertised on six million boxes of General Mills' Berry Berry Kix cereal this summer.
"This is a multimillion dollar investment, and we expect to break even in 24 to 36 months," he said.
