Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the debt rating on senior notes of Rowan Cos., reflecting its view that the company's increased exposure to the depressed drilling industry will result in continued losses.
The rating agency lowered the debt rating on the company's $200 million of 11.875% senior unsecured notes to Ba3 from Ba2.
Moody's said that it expects Rowan's Marathon LeTourneau acquisition, which is to close during the current quarter, will increase Rowan's "already considerable exposure" to "extremely volatile and unpredictable" exploration and development activity.
Rowan, a Houston offshore contract-drilling and helicopter-service provider, last year agreed to purchase the Marathon LeTourneau Co. unit of General Cable Corp. for about $50 million.
The unit produces heavy equipment for the mining and timber industries and builds drilling rigs.
Moody's said in a statement that the new rating factors in an expectation of some earnings improvement from the continuing strength of domestic gas prices, as well as Rowan's considerable liquidity.
For its part, Rowan said in a statement that while oil and gas prices are still unpredictable, it believes its 1994 first quarter will be much better than the 1993 first quarter's net loss of $13.5 million.
The company said its cash and receivables at year-end 1993 exceeded $200 million, up from $84 million a year earlier.
As for Marathon LeTourneau, the company was slightly profitable last year and "appears it will be profitable in the current quarter," said C.R. Palmer, Rowan's chairman and chief executive.
"I foresee no circumstance that will alter Rowan's ability or commitment to customers, employees, suppliers, lenders or shareholders."
