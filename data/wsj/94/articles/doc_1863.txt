Hewlett-Packard Co. announced a 30% price reduction on a desktop-scanning system and said it will sell the product with software of Calera Recognition Systems Inc.
Calera, of Sunnyvale, Calif., specializes in technology for recognizing characters.
With the reduction, Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett's ScanJet IIP scanner will have a list price of $599, the company said.
Separately, Hewlett announced two models of so-called server computers for sharing files among networks of personal computers.
The electronic-data concern said its NetServer LF computer starts at $3,349 and its NetServer LM starts at $4,449.
The systems give users a choice of several Intel Corp. microprocessor chips.
