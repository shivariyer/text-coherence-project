Thor Industries Inc. said it received its largest-ever order, valued at about $15 million, from Go Vacations Inc., a recreational-vehicle rental concern based in Toronto, to build 450 motor homes.
The maker of recreational vehicles and small and midsize buses said the vehicles will be built at its Four Winds facility in Elkhart, Ind., and will be shipped to Go Vacations' 10 rental centers in the U.S. and Canada beginning next month.
The order will increase production of the company's Class C motor homes by about 20%.
