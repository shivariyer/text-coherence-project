The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange said it will launch a new futures contract based on the FT-SE mid-250 equity index Feb. 25, three weeks after a competitor launches a similar contract.
Roger Barton, the exchange's managing director, said the new contract is the result of intensive research, and demand from Liffe members and U.K. fund managers looking to broaden their use of derivative products.
Volume on the FT-SE 100 futures contract on Liffe last year totaled 3,119,971, up 19% from a year earlier.
The FT-SE Index is Britain's most widely tracked measure of equity performance.
Mr. Barton said the recent performance of the FT-SE 250 Index determined the appropriate timing for a launch is now.
But Liffe apparently has been rushed into announcing the new contract because OMLX, the London Securities and Derivatives Exchange, plans to launch conventional and flexible futures and options on the index on Friday.
In an unexpected move last November, the London Stock Exchange awarded both OMLX and Liffe licenses to trade derivatives on the index of medium-sized U.K. companies.
