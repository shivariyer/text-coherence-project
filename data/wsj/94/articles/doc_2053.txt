The state's Consumer Protection Board said Nynex Corp. was wrongly passing on certain advertising costs to telephone customers, and asked local regulators to eliminate those charges from local phone rates.
The Baby Bell has launched an aggressive TV and print campaign lately to inform customers of its move to adopt the single Nynex brand name for all its telephone operating units.
Nynex, like other regulated phone companies, is prohibited from using ratepayer revenue to fund nonstandard phone services.
Nynex denied the board's accusation.
"None of the costs to promote the one-brand effort are coming from ratepayers," a spokesman said.
And a spokeswoman for the Public Service Commission said the regional phone company hasn't yet asked to recover advertising expenses through its rates.
