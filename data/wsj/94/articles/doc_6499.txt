Mobil Corp. said it will increase its 1994 capital and exploration budget by 17%, to $4.2 billion from last year's $3.6 billion.
Mobil's chairman, Allen E. Murray, said the increase "reflects a strong balance sheet and continued optimism about attractive opportunities for growth."
He added that the Fairfax, Va., oil concern will stay flexible and the budget can be revised "if the business environment warrants changes during the year."
Mr. Murray said 65% of the spending will be focused in the international area, about the same rate as last year.
Spending in 1993 was down from 1992's $4.5 billion because of the timing of some expenditures and a somewhat smaller capital appropriations budget.
Spending for exploration and producing will rise to $2.6 billion from $2 billion.
In marketing and refining, the budget will stay the same at $1.2 billion, and spending at the chemical division will remain at $300 million.
In addition to the capital and spending projected for this year, Mobil said its cash investments in equity companies will be about $200 million, double last year's level.
