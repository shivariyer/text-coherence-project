Dr. Otto L. Willbanks's March 7 Letter to the Editor "Canada's Health System on Brink of Bankruptcy" was most inaccurate.
Canada's health system is as bankrupt as the country's deficit or as bankrupt as America's $3 trillion-plus deficit: in other words, governments don't go "bankrupt."
The Canadian medical system is not a failure.
I and my friends have the means to opt out and go to private medicine, yet we have chosen to stay within the system.
Medical care is not hard to get, despite what the American media has said.
A two-hour visit in February to an American hospital emergency department with complaints of a sore elbow cost me $1,600 (Canadian).
Talk about a failure.
Our system works because it is simple, direct and has no interference from lobbyists, the media, the AMA and publicly traded health promoters.
