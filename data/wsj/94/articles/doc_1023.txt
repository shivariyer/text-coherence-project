Domtar Inc. said it plans to form a separate company from its groundwood printing papers division and sell it through a public offering in Canada.
Terms haven't been set, but Domtar expects to get more than the business's book value of 193 million Canadian dollars (US$141.1 million), said Pierre Fitzgibbon, Domtar's new chief financial officer.
The new company, to be called Alliance Forest Products Inc., comprises two paper mills and two sawmills in Quebec.
The business last year had revenue of about C$260 million, Mr. Fitzgibbon said.
Domtar, a Montreal-based maker of forest products, melamine panels and gypsum products, said the move fits its strategy of focusing on fewer sectors.
Proceeds from the transaction to close in May are to be used for investments and to reduce debt.
Domtar said Pierre Monahan is resigning as vice president and chief financial officer to become president and chief executive of Alliance Forest Products.
He is succeeded by Mr. Fitzgibbon, who had been vice president, corporate development, and treasurer.
