Garnet Resources Corp., Houston, said a Russian oil company agreed to drill an exploratory well on land licensed to Garnet in southwestern Turkey.
Garnet, an oil and natural-gas exploration company, said it agreed not to identify the Russian company that will start drilling by Aug 20.
Garnet said the well site is on a 1.7-million-acre block 65 miles north of Antalya on Turkey's Mediterranean coast.
Drilling the well will increase the Russian company's 20% interest in the block to 40%, and that interest will increase to 65% if the Russian company drills a second well, Garnet said.
Garnet's interest will be 27.78% after the first well and 13.89% if both wells are drilled, the company said.
After both wells are drilled, Global Natural Resources Corp. will have an 11.11% interest in the block, and a multicompany joint venture, which Garnet did not identify, will hold the remaining 10%.
