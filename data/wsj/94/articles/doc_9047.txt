SPX Corp., Muskegon, Mich., said it agreed to acquire an additional 49% interest in Sealed Power Technologies Ltd.
Partnership from Riken Corp., Tokyo, in a transaction valued at $239 million.
SPX, an auto-parts supplier, already holds a 49% interest in Sealed Power Technologies, which makes vehicle replacement parts.
The latest acquisition will result in a $100 million charge against fourth-quarter earnings, SPX said.
That charge will be partially offset by an estimated $65 million gain from the previously reported sale of SPX's Sealed Power Replacement and Truth divisions.
