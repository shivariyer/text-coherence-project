Olympia & York Developments Ltd.'s U.S. subsidiary agreed in principle to hand over one of its prime New York office towers to the building's creditors.
The creditors, who hold $200 million in bonds secured by the property at 59 Maiden Lane in lower Manhattan, had previously called their loan after the subsidiary, Olympia & York Cos.
(USA), breached certain covenants of the loan agreement.
The parties resolved the dispute through negotiation.
The O&Y unit continued to pay interest on the 10.375% bonds, which were due to mature in 1995.
For the O&Y unit, the agreement quells a contentious group of creditors as the company negotiates to restructure a total of $5 billion of debt.
It also removes the company from future responsibility to fund asbestos removal and tenant improvements when the 43-story building's main leases expire in 1999.
Olympia & York (USA) "is not shy about dropping buildings.
They're committed to get down to core holdings and assets that will provide long-term values," a company spokesman said.
The company doesn't expect to continue to manage 59 Maiden Lane for the new owners, the spokesman said.
David Brail at Dickstein & Co., a New York distressed-bond concern that helped negotiate the agreement, said 59 Maiden Lane had $27 million of income last year before interest payments.
"The building is very profitable," he said.
Major tenants include Home Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Under terms of the agreement, the creditors will pay the O&Y unit $3.5 million plus certain of its expenses.
Ownership of the building will be reorganized through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing into a real-estate investment trust, shares of which will be held by the current bondholders.
Olympia & York Developments Ltd. is based in Toronto.
It reorganized last year under Canadian bankruptcy law and is currently controlled by its creditors, mainly Canadian banks.
