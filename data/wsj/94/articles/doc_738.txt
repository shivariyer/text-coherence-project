Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 5,000 last week to 340,000 from a revised 345,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said.
The four-week average, which is considered a better barometer of the labor market than the one-week figure, declined 8,750 to 337,250 from a revised 346,000 in the previous week.
The figures are adjusted for seasonal changes.
