Lockheed Corp., Calabasas, Calif., said representatives of the Turkish and U.S. governments agreed for Turkey to receive 40 more of Lockheed's F-16 fighter jets.
A spokesman for Lockheed's Fort Worth, Texas, division estimated the value of the agreement to Lockheed at $350 million, or about $8.75 million per plane.
He said a formal contract is expected "in a matter of weeks."
The agreement provides for the planes to be delivered beginning in 1998 from a factory operated near Ankara, Turkey, by Tusas Aerospace Industries Inc., a joint venture partly owned by Lockheed.
The planes are assembled in Turkey from parts produced by Lockheed and Turkish manufacturers.
Turkey's latest purchase would increase its total of F-16s either in service or on order to 240.
