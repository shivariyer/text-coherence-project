Struggling small-company stocks fell sharply for a fourth straight day, with one key index hitting its lowest closing level of 1994.
Small-stock prices gave back everything they had gained this year, despite the fact that both the Russell 2000 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index set record highs just a week and a half ago.
The Russell 2000 Index fell to 257.04, a loss of 5.47, or 2.08%.
The barometer started the year at 258.59.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market, widespread weakness and a continued assault on the technology sector ripped 17.21, or 2.23%, from the Nasdaq Composite Index, sending it to its lowest closing level this year, 755.29.
The index began 1994 at 776.80.
Smaller issues, along with the rest of the market, were down sharply all day, receiving another jolt minutes before the close when the "uptick rule" was triggered on the Big Board after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 50 points.
The rule restricts program trading.
The Dow industrials average ended 63.33 lower at 3699.02 and has lost 170 points in the past four trading sessions.
Observers attribute the recent bloodletting in the small-cap group primarily to overall market declines caused by rising interest rates.
But they add that small stocks were particularly susceptible to a steep correction because they were deeply overbought.
Declining issues surged past Nasdaq advancers, 2,323 to 888, on Nasdaq National Market volume of 266,175,400 shares and total volume of 309,556,000.
On Monday, National Market volume was 267,522,800 shares while overall volume was 300,924,000.
In the small-cap arena, Physician Computer Network, Laurence Harbor, N.J., dropped 3/4 to 4; Weitek, a Sunnyvale, Calif., integrated circuits concern, slid 1 to 6 7/8, and Asante Technologies, a San Jose, Calif., data networking firm, sagged 1 1/4 to 9.
Meanwhile, America Online continued its roller-coaster ride, falling 4 1/2 to 77.
The Wall Street Journal reported that new competition looms for the Vienna, Va., company next year.
In earnings news, Micrografx, Richardson, Texas, slid 1 1/2 to 6 7/8.
After the close Monday, the company said it expects a fiscal fourth-quarter and fiscal 1994 loss due to lower-than-anticipated revenue from its professional graphics products.
The software company posted a 1993 fiscal fourth-quarter loss of 51 cents a share on charges and a loss of 34 cents for the year, also on charges.
Similarly, Comverse Technology's disappointing 1994 earnings outlook lopped 4 7/8 from its stock price, causing it to end at 9 1/8.
The Woodbury, N.Y., computer systems company said significant increases in planned investment operations and a slowing in large Government Systems Division orders will likely cause 1994 net operating results to decline from the 1993 levels.
For 1993, Comverse earned 65 cents a share.
A poor fiscal second-quarter earnings outlook sent Geneva Steel down 2 to 15 on the Big Board.
The Vineyard, Utah, company said late yesterday that it expects to report a loss of $14 million to $15 million for the period on $10 million of extraordinary financing costs.
In the same quarter last year, Geneva Steel reported a loss of $4.6 million.
Empi skidded 4 to 10 7/8.
Late Monday, the St. Paul, Minn., developer of biomedical devices said its first-quarter net income and sales will fall below analysts' expectations of 29 cents to 30 cents a share on sales of $17.7 million to $18.3 million.
American Medical Electronics plunged 3 3/4 to 13.
The Richardson, Texas, medical device company said its board continues to seek the resignation of long-time President and Chief Executive Joseph Mooibroek, due to the "necessity for a change of leadership."
Mr. Mooibroek refused to resign but requested that the company's four outside directors submit resignations, which they declined to do.
New issues managed to duck the broadbased losses.
First Alert jumped to 18 3/4 from its initial offering price of $17.
The Aurora, Ill., maker of home smoke detectors and other safety products said proceeds will go toward repaying subordinated debt and reducing long-term bank debt.

Applied Digital Access climbed to 15 1/4 from its offering price of 12 yesterday morning.
The San Diego maker of network test and performance-monitoring systems plans to use proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Paul-Son Gaming, Las Vegas, rose to 12 1/4 from its offering price of 11 1/4 a share.
Proceeds will go to expand operations, upgrade management information systems, repay bank debt and retire indebtedness to former holders and for working capital.
Silver King Communications, St. Petersburg, Fla., gained 1 1/4 to 11 3/4.
The Wall Street Journal reported that cable-industry executives say Turner Broadcasting System might be interested in 12 UHF stations operated as Home Shopping Network affiliates by Silver King, which was recently spun off by Home Shopping.
The Russell and Nasdaq Composite "were quite extended and they had more to give up," said Anthony O'Bryan, a market analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.
"Also, the Nasdaq Composite is heavily weighted with big-cap tech issues which have been hammered pretty well lately."
Mr. O'Bryan said smaller stocks, and equities in general, are due for a bounce after the huge losses accrued in the past few days.
But that won't happen this week "without help from bonds."
But other market watchers are more dubious.
"The Nasdaq and the Russell had been outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index and the Dow industrials -- because they would hold up better and then rally," said Greg Kuhn, who heads Kuhn Asset Management.
What was alarming, however, was that technology issues nearly singlehandedly led the advance, Mr. Kuhn added.
Now that sellers have brutalized tech stocks, there is very little other leadership to maintain the highs.
Mr. Kuhn sees warning signals from the poor breadth and rising rates.
He recommends small-cap investors raise their cash levels to 100% based on a belief that the correction is far from over.
Earlier, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and Smith Barney Shearson Inc. recommended that market players cut their stock and bond exposure and increase their cash holdings.
