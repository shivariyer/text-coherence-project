IGI Inc. said it plans to rid itself of its unprofitable biotechnology operations by spinning them off as a separate publicly traded company to shareholders.
The plan is subject to a favorable tax ruling on the spinoff and certain financing arrangements, among other factors.
"The purpose of the spinoff is to provide enhanced access" for both companies to the capital markets, said Buena, N.J.-based IGI, which also makes and markets animal-care, cosmetic and personal-care products.
The company reported a net loss for 1993 of $4.2 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with the modest net income a year earlier of $66,032, or one cent a share.
Revenue rose 15% to $28 million.
The 1993 net loss included a $3.2 million operating loss on the biotechnology operations, as well as a $2.8 million allowance for costs of the planned spinoff.
A year earlier, the profit included biotechnology operating losses of $1.3 million.
In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange, IGI closed at $11.25, down 75 cents, or 6.3%.
