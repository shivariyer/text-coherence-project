How much largess can Texas afford?
As your article correctly points out, just about every business relocation or expansion in the state is now accompanied by a "bribe" in the form of tax abatements, low-interest loans, freeport exemptions and the like.
But promises of new jobs and tax revenues are always exaggerated, and the Texas taxpayer winds up footing the bill.
Maybe it will take a class-action lawsuit by those who are subsidizing the recipients to stop the nonsense!
Instead of misallocating scarce fiscal resources and continuing to erode our tax base, we should be focusing the state's economic-development efforts on the factors that really matter, such as public education, adult literacy, physical infrastructure, regulatory reform and business retention.
