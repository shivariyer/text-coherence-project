Southwest Airlines said that February traffic, including Morris Air, rose nearly 24% from February 1993.
The carrier reported 1.6 billion revenue passenger miles for the month, up from 1.3 billion miles for February 1993.
A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile.
Load factor, or percentage of available seats filled, rose to 66.9% from 66.7% a year earlier.
Separately, Southwest said it will offer daily nonstop flights between San Jose International Airport in San Jose, Calif., and Lindbergh Field in San Diego, starting April 15.
The airline said fares on the five daily flights will be $69 each way.
