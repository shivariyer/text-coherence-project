The Republican National Committee denounced a proposal pending before the Securities and Exchange Commission designed to end the "pay to play" practice in the municipal-bond market.
In a comment letter filed with the SEC, the Republicans predicted the proposed rule won't survive constitutional scrutiny and called for its immediate withdrawal.
SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said recently he believes the rule will pass constitutional muster and that the SEC's lawyers share this view.
Drafted by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the rule would bar a bond dealer from doing business with a jurisdiction within two years of making a political contribution to an official of the jurisdiction.
The SEC's comment period on the proposal just ended, and it is expected to act on the rule before long.
Noting the rule would cover contributions to state and local officials running for federal office as well as incumbent state and local officials and candidates for state and local office, the Republican National Committee said in a comment letter that federal law gives the Federal Election Commission exclusive civil jurisdiction over federal campaign-finance activity.
It said that because incumbents in Congress could take political gifts from bond dealers while state or local officials challenging federal lawmakers couldn't, the rule "raises serious `equal protection' constitutional concerns."
The MSRB has said its proposal is immune from constitutional challenge because the board, a self-regulatory body subject to SEC oversight, is not "a government actor."
But the National Association of State Treasurers called this stance "disingenuous," and told the SEC that the proposal "will have to satisfy constitutional scrutiny."
Attempts to ascertain the Democratic National Committee's views on the proposal weren't immediately successful.
