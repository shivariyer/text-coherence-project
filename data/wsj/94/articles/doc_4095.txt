The United Auto Workers union threatened to strike General Motors Corp.'s assembly plant in Oklahoma City as soon as Wednesday in yet another backlash against the auto maker's productivity campaign.
The union, which is negotiating a new local contract with GM, is upset because plant workers are experiencing a rising number of repetitive trauma injuries, said Mike Hermes, vice president of UAW local 1999.
Mr. Hermes attributed the injuries to GM's productivity drive, which has eliminated 2,000 workers in the plant and speeded up many jobs.
The plant currently employs 4,300.
The Oklahoma City plant produces two midsized sedans, the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and Buick Century.
A GM spokeswoman declined to comment on the contract negotiations in Oklahoma City, but said the company was hopeful about reaching a new contract without a strike.
Last month, the UAW struck GM's truck-assembly plant in Shreveport, La., for four days after GM increased the plant's line speed.
The strike ended after GM agreed to add 100 workers.
