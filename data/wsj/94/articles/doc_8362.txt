Bass PLC told shareholders that the "gentle" recovery in the U.K. economy is having little benefit on its business of brewing and hotels.
Ian Prosser, chairman, said at the annual meeting that the company would have to seek improvements for the year as a whole from management action rather than business conditions.
Mr. Prosser said the beer business had been volatile but that Christmas sales were slightly above 1992's level.
However, profit margins have been pressured by competition.
Bass said that in its Bass Taverns division fiscal 1994 profit is slightly ahead of fiscal 1993, although the division is operating nearly 10% fewer outlets.
The reduction in the number of outlets will probably affect Bass Taverns' profit by about #9 million ($13.4 million) in the year's first half.
The fiscal year ends in September.
Profitability is being boosted by cost reduction but Bass repeated that profit will be reduced an additional #5 million this year.
Bass first made that announcement in December.
In its hotels operations, Bass said Holiday Inn Worldwide dollar profits "continue to move forward" with the addition of hotels.
A further 282 hotels are to be opened to add to the 1,795 hotels that already operate under the name.
In the U.S., both franchised hotels and Bass's company-managed hotels have improved revenue per room by 1.7% and 2.6%, respectively.
In Europe, however, Holiday Inn is still experiencing difficult trading.
Average room rates are down more than 5% from a year ago although the U.K. has begun to show some improvement after several years of weak trading.
Overall, Bass said that despite the extra cost of duties announced by the government in late 1993, operating profit is a little above that for the first six months of fiscal 1993.
But pretax profit is likely to be "broadly in line" with the year before as the lower sterling deposit rates and the strong dollar have meant higher net interest payable.
