Patrick Petroleum Co., Jackson, Mich., said it will take a fourth-quarter $9.7 million charge related to the write-down of some oil and gas properties, which will result in a loss for the fiscal year.
In the year-earlier quarter, Patrick had a loss of $20.1 million, or $1.62 a share.
That quarter also included a $17 million writedown of oil and gas properties and other assets.
For all of 1992, Patrick had a loss of $21.9 million, or $1.79 a share.
In light of the losses and in an effort to improve Patrick's shareholder value, the company said it is considering a merger, sale of assets or other actions.
The company said it is negotiating the sale of its 9.4% stake in Penske Corp., a Detroit holding company controlled by entrepreneur Roger Penske.
The deal is expected to be completed this spring.
