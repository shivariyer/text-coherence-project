Emulex Corp., Costa Mesa, Calif., a maker of computer-network-communications equipment, said it will hold a special shareholders meeting Feb. 24 to approve terms of a distribution of all the stock in its QLogic Corp. unit.
Emulex said holders of record Jan. 14 will be asked to approve a 1-for-2 reverse split in Emulex stock, resulting in about 5.5 million Emulex shares outstanding, and then a 1-for-1 distribution of QLogic stock to Emulex holders.
Emulex said a record date for the distribution hasn't been fixed.
Shares of QLogic, which sells a line of small-computer-interface devices, are expected to trade on the Nasdaq National Market System, Emulex said.
