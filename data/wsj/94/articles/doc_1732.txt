Avon Products Inc. launched a line of intimate apparel and casual clothing for women in the U.S. and said it expects the line to contribute $65 million to $75 million in sales this year.
The line, called "Avon Style," includes Warners and Fruit of the Loom foundation garments, Scaasi sleepwear and casual sportswear.
Avon Style is featured in a separate 16-page catalog and in an eight-page insert in New York-based Avon's regular brochures.
"The results of our market testing of the apparel line in the United States last fall were outstanding," said James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer.
Brand-name apparel is a relatively new item for Avon in the U.S., but the company said it sells apparel in 17 countries.
Last year, the company's apparel sales were more than $350 million.
