Westinghouse Electric Corp., in another break from the past, named Fredric G. Reynolds, a PepsiCo Inc. executive, chief financial officer and executive vice president.
Mr. Reynolds's appointment follows by seven months the naming of another outsider, Michael H. Jordan, to be chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr. Jordan and Mr. Reynolds worked together at PepsiCo, where the 43-year-old Mr. Reynolds most recently was chief financial officer of PepsiCo Foods International.
He succeeds Warren H. Hollinshead, whose ties to former Chairman Paul E. Lego were considered by analysts to be too strong.
Mr. Lego's management team lacked credibility on Wall Street.
Mr. Hollinshead, 58, is retiring.
In a statement, Mr. Jordan, who is attempting to revive Westinghouse's sluggish operations and revamp its finances, said Mr. Reynolds "brings strong operational experience and a strategic financial background that we need to help us achieve financial credibility and a strong performance culture at Westinghouse."
He also noted that Mr. Reynolds has a strong international background.
Much of Mr. Jordan's business experience lies in the international arena, which is one of his chief focuses for Westinghouse.
Maureen P. Lentz, an analyst with Roulston & Co. in Cleveland, called Westinghouse's decision to reach outside the company for a chief financial officer "a good move" because it represents a break with the past.
One of the first challenges Mr. Reynolds will face is helping the company sell $500 million in preferred stock, considered by Mr. Jordan to be crucial for the company's growth.
Mr. Reynolds also will face a huge task in aiding Mr. Jordan's plan to squeeze earnings growth from what are considered by many to be slow-growth businesses mired in an inbred culture.
Westinghouse's core businesses include power generation, broadcasting, electronic systems and Thermo King, a transportation-refrigeration company.
