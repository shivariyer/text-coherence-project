In a bid to boost the value of its stock, Hollinger Inc., the publishing empire controlled by Conrad Black, plans a public sale of as much as 30% of its stake in its UniMedia Inc. unit.
Hollinger said it could follow the 40 million Canadian dollar (US$29.6 million) initial public offering of UniMedia stock with the sale of up to a third of its American Publishing Co. unit through a similar transaction in the U.S. in a few months.
David Radler, president and chief operating officer of Hollinger, said the company's main purpose in the UniMedia sale is to help investors put a "reasonable" value on Hollinger and its assets.
"We have a number of subsidiaries, and we don't think that their value is reflected in the value of Hollinger shares," Mr. Radler said.
Even the sale of part of Hollinger's flagship newspaper, Britain's Daily Telegraph, to the British public and obtaining a listing for those shares has failed to propel Hollinger's value upward.
In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Hollinger shares closed at C$14 a share, down 50 Canadian cents.
Once the UniMedia issue is completed, expected in mid-March, the company will hold not only the Quebec newspapers that formed the basis of Mr. Black's publishing empire but also Sterling Newspapers Ltd., which owns and operates a chain of newspapers in western Canada.
Hollinger said it will keep its minority holdings in Southam Inc., a Toronto-based publishing and printing concern, and in the Financial Post newspaper.
But UniMedia will be Hollinger's "preferred investment company in Canada" for future newspaper acquisitions.
