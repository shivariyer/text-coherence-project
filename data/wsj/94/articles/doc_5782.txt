Gitano Group Inc., which recently put itself up for sale, said it expects to report fourth-quarter net income of about $4 million and a narrower net loss for all of 1993.
New York-based Gitano, which has spent the past year downsizing its jeans and budget-apparel business, said that it expects to post a fourth-quarter profit compared with a net loss of $146 million the year earlier, when it had $100 million in restructuring charges.
For all of 1993, Gitano expects to report a net loss of $45 million compared with a 1992 net loss of $238 million.
Since Gitano put itself on the block last month, its management has been "holding discussions with a number of interested parties," the company said in a news release.
Gitano reiterated that it isn't unlikely that a sale of Gitano will realize an amount in excess of the $130 million Gitano owes to its secured lenders.
The company has phased out its manufacturing businesses and now is a marketer of apparel using the Gitano label.
GITANO GROUP Inc., which is up for sale, reiterated last week that it is "unlikely that a sale of Gitano will realize an amount in excess of the $130 million Gitano owes to its secured lenders."
