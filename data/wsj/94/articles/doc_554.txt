Insurance losses from winter storms, the Los Angeles earthquake and other catastrophes are expected to exceed $7 billion for the first quarter of 1994, one of the worst periods ever for the nation's property and casualty insurers.
The latest catastrophe claim estimates overshadow a report issued yesterday showing that the insurers posted net income of $18.5 billion last year, more than three times the $5.8 billion net income in the catastrophe-ridden year of 1992, according to the Insurance Services Office Inc. and the National Association of Independent Insurers.
The $7 billion estimate does not include a string of tornadoes that hit four Southern states over the weekend.
Sean Mooney, senior vice president of the Insurance Information Institute, said, "From an insurance point of view, this will be the worst winter on record."
In contrast, in the full-year 1993, losses from catastrophes totaled just $5.7 billion.
In 1992, the nation's worst year for catastrophes, insurers posted $23 billion in catastrophe losses, and the second-worst year, 1989, left them with $7.6 billion in disaster red ink.
"It's a little bit of calm between storms," Mr. Mooney said of the 1993 figures, which are estimated to represent 96% of the country's property and casualty-insurance business.
"We're obviously very concerned about 1994."
While the tornadoes quickly met the $5 million, 1,000-claim threshold in insured property losses to be declared a catastrophe, damage estimates are not expected for several days, according to the American Insurance Services Group, a trade group and official scorekeeper for disaster claims.
For 1993, the two insurance-trade groups found that the industry's underwriting loss dropped to $18.7 billion from $36 billion, a decline mainly explained by fewer catastrophes.
Among 1993's worst disasters was a blizzard that edged up the East Coast, while 1992 gave the industry two major hurricanes, including the $16.5 billion Andrew.
In addition to higher claim losses, analysts say that the insurance companies could earn less income on their investments this year if the bond market continues to perform poorly.
The trade groups said that property and casualty insurers had pretax operating profit of $13.2 billion in 1993, exclusive of realized capital gains, a sharp improvement over 1992's loss of $2.5 billion.
The underwriting loss was 8% of earned premiums of $234.9 billion, down from the 15.9% of earned premiums of $226 billion for 1992.
In the fourth quarter of 1993, the industry's consolidated net income was $5.9 billion, against a net loss of $1.2 billion a year earlier.
But the $8 billion of net investment income for the fourth quarter of 1993 was down 4.3% from $8.3 billion a year earlier.
Meanwhile, A.M. Best Co., the insurance rating concern, said there's more bad news on the horizon for property and casualty insurers, stemming from underwriting of years past.
Yesterday, the rating concern said the insurers, over the next 25 years, will face environmental and asbestos claims with a value, in today's dollars, of $132 billion.
But those insurers have so far reserved or paid just $15 billion in claims.
As a result, "you're going to have substantial earnings drain and capital depreciation" for the 50 or so insurers who wrote most of the insurance at companies facing the liabilities, said John Snyder, an A.M. Best senior vice president.
Mr. Snyder said possible Superfund reform might lessen the cost to insurers by curtailing litigation costs and streamlining cleanup processes.
