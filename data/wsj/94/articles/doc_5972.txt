Amsco International Inc. reported sharply lower fourth-quarter earnings partly because of lower gross margins and a drop in customer orders for capital equipment.
The Pittsburgh company, a supplier of infection control, decontamination, and surgical products and services, said profit plunged 60% to $6.2 million, or 20 cents a share, from $15.3 million, or 47 cents a share, a year ago.
The period included a loss of $4.9 million, or 16 cents a share, from the company's investment in the Amsco Sterile Recoveries Inc. unit, compared with a loss of $2.6 million, or seven cents a share, for the same investment in the 1992 quarter.
Sales dropped 10% to $146.8 million from $163.9 million.
Customer orders for capital equipment fell 24% to $77.3 million.
Amsco said it will eliminate about 100 jobs world-wide as a result of reorganizing its operations around two global groups, one for marketing, product development and manufacturing, and the other for product sales and service activities.
