BMC Software Inc., abandoning its reliance on mainframe technology, said it acquired closely held Patrol Software, which uses "smart agent" technology to troll for problems on corporate computer networks.
BMC said it paid $33.7 million for Patrol, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., and its Patrol Software Pty. Ltd. affiliate in Australia.
The purchase marks a sharp turnabout in strategy for BMC, which currently derives all of its revenue from mainframe-computer technology.
The company has surprised many analysts in its ability to stay profitable despite a stampede away from mainframes to smaller machines like workstations and servers tied to networks of personal computers.
During the fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30, BMC reported net income of $20.2 million, or 77 cents a share, on revenue of $68 million.
BMC didn't provide revenue or earnings figures for Patrol.
Though BMC said it still will sell mainframe software, its focus now will be on computer networks used by companies to run applications critical to their business.
Russ Caccamisi, BMC's executive director of marketing, said the company expects its nonmainframe revenue to grow to "double digit" percentages from zero over the next several quarters as BMC begins to market Patrol's technology.
Patrol's software uses "knowledge modules," known elsewhere as "smart agents," to patrol computer networks in search of problems that could lead to lost time or mangled data.
Problems spotted by the agents are relayed to a central console and, possibly, fixed before the system collapses.
Mr. Caccamisi said the technology is designed to appeal to corporate information directors, who still fear a loss in control and oversight as they seek to shift to smaller computing platforms.
"It's impossible to manage these networks with human beings," Mr. Caccamisi said.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday, BMC stock closed at $63.25, up $3.
