The Empire State Building will undergo some $1.8 million in renovations to make it more accessible to the disabled as part of a settlement with the Justice Department.
The agreement settles one of the first complaints filed under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
The complaint was filed in January 1992 against HelmsleySpear Inc., the managing agent, and Empire State Building Co., the leaseholder, by New York Lawyers for the Public Interest Inc., on behalf of an advocacy group for the disabled.
Among the changes at the landmark, most of which are scheduled to be completed this year, are the addition of ramps to the observation decks and the installation of special, lower telescopes for the wheelchair-bound.
The Justice Department, which didn't sue in the case, said it has 900 investigations related to ADA complaints, and has filed or is involved in 15 lawsuits.
