United Asset Management Corp., citing rising fees and contributions from acquisitions, said it expects to report a 27% to 29% rise in fourth-quarter net income on a 9% revenue gain.
William H. Park, senior vice president, said the Boston money-management company expects to report net income of $14.6 million to $14.8 million, or 49 cents to 50 cents a share, for the fourth quarter, on revenue of about $118 million.
In the year-earlier quarter, United Asset had net income of $11.5 million, or 44 cents a share, on revenue of $108 million.
Results have been restated to reflect a pooling of interests from acquisitions.
United Asset owns 38 money-management units with $105 billion in assets.
Mr. Park said the quarter's revenue increased because of market appreciation.
Market performance, coupled with client contributions to portfolios, increased total assets 12%, to $84 billion at Dec. 31, 1993.
Five acquisitions last year, and two startups, contributed the balance of asset gains.
