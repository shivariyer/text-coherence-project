Three cheers for Paul Gigot and his Dec. 27 editorial-page article "Syria Diary: Assad Has a Deal We Can Refuse."
He articulates the many grave difficulties faced by Israel in negotiating peace with Syria.
Assad's brutal dictatorship is a giant destabilizing influence in the Middle East.
Israel, as America's best friend in the U.N. and as the only legitimate democracy in the region, deserves our staunch support and encouragement throughout the peace process.
Our administration's overtures to the Syrians provoke grave anxieties on the part of Americans who are well-informed about the realities of the Middle East.
