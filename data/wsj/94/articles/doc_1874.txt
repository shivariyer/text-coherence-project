General Motors Corp. reached a tentative labor agreement that could end a strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants.
The strike had already idled two assembly plants.
The strike was provoked by GM's proposal to stop producing a brake caliper in Dayton and instead buy it from an outside supplier with lower labor costs.
The United Auto Workers union said as many as 650 jobs could be lost by the action.
Neither side would say how the caliper debate was resolved, but a joint statement from both company and union said the settlement would increase "job security" for Dayton workers.
The 3,000 workers in Dayton were to remain on strike this morning pending the outcome of a 10 a.m. EST ratification vote on the tentative agreement.
"Assuming the contract is ratified, the Dayton plants will resume full production on the second shift," a GM spokesman said.
The strike shut down GM's Fort Wayne, Ind., truck plant, which produces its hot-selling full-size pickup truck, and GM's Lansing, Mich., assembly operations, which build the Pontiac Grand Am, the Buick Skylark and the Oldsmobile Achieva.
In addition, GM said it halted its medium-duty truck line in Janesville, Wis., though it kept the rest of the facility running.
A total of 7,900 assembly workers were sent home because of the strike.
