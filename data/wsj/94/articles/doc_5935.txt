TRW Inc., Cleveland, reported a 7.8% jump in fourth-quarter profit, boosted by strong results in its North American automotive operations and lower interest expenses.
Profit rose to $63.6 million, or 96 cents a share, from $59 million, or 94 cents a share, in 1992.
Sales fell to $2 billion from $2.1 billion for the company, which operates automotive, space and defense and other businesses.
TRW said increased sales from its North American and European air-bag systems business were more than offset by lower space and defense industry sales.
The company said a restructuring program completed last year improved its financial performance.
"TRW should benefit in 1994 from higher North American vehicle production," including increased orders for its air-bag products, and improved performance in the steering systems business world-wide.
"We expect little improvement in the European economy this year," TRW added.
