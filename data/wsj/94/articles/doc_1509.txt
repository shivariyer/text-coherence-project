A group led by Mirror Group Newspapers PLC was given government clearance to buy a majority stake in Newspaper Publishing PLC, which owns the Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers.
Earlier, the Mirror consortium had won a bidding battle for Newspaper Publishing against Independent Newspapers PLC, a Dublin-based publishing company controlled by Tony O'Reilly, chairman of H.J. Heinz Co.
Mirror Group's partners in the purchase are the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, the Spanish newspaper El Pais and some founders of Newspaper Publishing.
The consortium will own about 66% of Newspaper Publishing, up from 47% prior to the takeover battle.
Mr. O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers will own a 29.9% stake, but there was speculation that, having lost the takeover battle, he might sell his holdings to the Mirror consortium.
