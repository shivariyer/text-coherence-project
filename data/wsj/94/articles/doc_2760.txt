BANKERS LIFE HOLDING Corp. raised its quarterly to 15 cents a share from two cents, payable April 1 to stock of record March 18.
The Chicago-based insurance holding company said the increase reflects the board's confidence that the company's operations will continue to generate strong earnings and cash flow.
The company recently reported a 51% increase in 1993 pro forma net income to $136.1 million, or $2.49 a share.
In addition, it said the board believed the dividend should be "comparable to the rate paid by its peer life/health insurance companies."
