Imo Industries Inc., Lawrenceville, N.J., said it recorded a $168 million anticipated loss on disposal of its Electro-Optical Systems Inc. business, and plans workforce cuts by mid-1994.
The disposal decision resulted in a fourth-quarter loss of $245.6 million, or $14.52 a share, compared with net income of $333,000, or two cents a share, one year ago.
Revenue declined 24% to $153.1 million from $201.9 million.
The company, which makes analytical and optical instruments, electronic and mechanical controls and engineered power products, took a $9 million charge to account for a plan that will eliminate 700 jobs, or 11% of its work force.
The company added that it would seek a waiver from the holders of some of its debt in order to borrow an additional $35 million for working capital and letters of credit.
Imo, which announced its results after the market closed, finished down 12.5 cents at $8 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
