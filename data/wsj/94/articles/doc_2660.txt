R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. said it plans to acquire a 51% stake in Editorial Lord Cochrane SA, a printing company in Chile, for $58.7 million.
Donnelley, the world's largest commercial printing company, said Cochrane's primary operation is a printing plant in Santiago that produces magazines, catalogs, directories and books.
Cochrane also has joint-venture interests in companies that print magazines and catalogs in Buenos Aires and in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and in companies involved in magazine distribution and pre-press operations in Argentina and Chile.
The Chicago company said the deal, expected to close in mid-April, will mark its first venture in South America.
The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including completion of due-diligence studies and approval by its board.
