ElectroCom Automation Inc., Arlington, Texas, said it expects to report fourth-quarter earnings were between 34 cents and 38 cents a share, G.D. "Dan" Thompson, president and chief executive, said.
The company had earnings of $6.8 million, or 25 cents a share, on sales of $88.8 million a year earlier.
Sales totaled $119 million to $129 million in the latest quarter.
The 1993 fourth-quarter results were within analysts' forecasts of 35 cents to 40 cents a share, the company said.
For the year, the maker of automated document processors and package sorters expects to report per-share earnings of $1.04 to $1.08 on sales of $405 million to $415 million.
The company had profit of $27.7 million, or $1.02 a share, on sales of $469.8 million a year earlier.
Mr. Thompson repeated the company's prediction that its results in 1994 will resemble 1993's numbers.
