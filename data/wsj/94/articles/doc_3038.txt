In a move to bring back one of its most prolific producers of the 1980s, Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit signed an exclusive joint venture agreement with Jon Peters that calls for him to develop movies and other entertainment projects.
Mr. Peters resumes his association with Warner nearly five years after he left that company, along with longtime partner Peter Guber, to run Sony Corp.'s Hollywood studio.
Sony, which paid $3.4 billion for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. in 1989, subsequently paid $200 million to buy the Guber-Peters Co.
Warner promptly sued Sony, seeking $1 billion in damages for stealing the producers who, under exclusive contract to Warner, made such films as "Batman."
Sony settled the suit by giving Warner various rights and assets valued by analysts at over $500 million at that time.
Though Mr. Guber remains chairman and chief executive at the renamed Sony Pictures, Mr. Peters's tenure there was short-lived.
In May 1991, he left his post as co-chairman to start his own entertainment company tied to the Sony unit.
Mr. Peters said he still has a half-dozen ongoing projects there, which he will continue to oversee.
However, he will focus his energies at Warner and will relocate to its Burbank, Calif., lot.
Mr. Peters, a onetime hairdresser who was closely associated with Barbra Streisand in the 1970s, produced "A Star is Born," "The Main Event," and "Caddyshack."
In association with Mr. Guber, he produced "Gorillas in the Mist," "The Witches of Eastwick," "The Color Purple" and "Rain Man."
