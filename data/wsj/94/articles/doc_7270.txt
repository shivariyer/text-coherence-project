McKesson Corp. said it will lower its stake in its Armor All Products Corp. unit by offering $140 million principal amount of debentures exchangeable into Armor All common shares.
McKesson, whose principal business is health-care services, has been steadily lowering its stake in Armor All, which makes car-care products.
"As we continue to focus more on the health-care business we feel Armor All will have a better future as an independent company," a McKesson spokesman said in San Francisco.
McKesson sold 17% of its stake in Armor All in 1986 and another 26% of the company last year.
Currently, McKesson holds about 12 million Armor All shares, or 57% of the 21 million shares outstanding.
