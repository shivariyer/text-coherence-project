ABC News said it is looking into an incident of staging on "World News Tonight With Peter Jennings."
In the Jan. 26 incident, the broadcast aired a report from correspondent Cokie Roberts, who was shown in front of Capitol Hill wearing a coat.
Mr. Jennings referred several times to the fact that she was live on Capitol Hill.
In fact, Ms. Roberts was in the studio and the Capitol scene was imposed electronically, but Mr. Jennings did not know that.
The newscast frequently uses such a backdrop for cosmetic reasons but always makes clear that the reporter is not actually at the scene.
Ms. Roberts was wearing the coat, which added to the illusion, at the request of the newscast's new executive producer, Rick Kaplan.
Through an ABC News spokeswoman, Mr. Kaplan declined to comment yesterday on the incident, which was a violation of ABC News policy.
The incident was first reported in yesterday's issue of Variety, a trade paper.
ABC News is a division of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
