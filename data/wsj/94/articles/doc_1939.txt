Kmart Corp. directors declined to increase the company's quarterly dividend, but stopped short of saying they will halt the retailer's record of 29 consecutive years of higher dividends.
In leaving the quarterly payout unchanged at 24 cents a share, Kmart said the board recognizes the "importance" of the dividend record, but said "based on 1993 results, it is premature to consider increasing" the payout this spring.
Hit by restructuring and other charges, Kmart posted a loss of $974 million, or $2.15 a share, in 1993 on sales of $34.16 billion.
Kmart typically increases its dividend at this time of year, but a spokesman said the board could still increase it later in the year.
The latest dividend is payable June 13 to holders of record May 12.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading, Kmart was quoted at $18, up 12.5 cents.
