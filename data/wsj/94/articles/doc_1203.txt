BellSouth Corp. will likely push to revise the terms of its proposed $500 million investment in QVC Inc., looking for a cheaper price tag or other adjustments to offset a steep slide in QVC's share price.
The Atlanta-based regional Bell telephone company has until Aug. 15 to decide whether to proceed with the investment in Barry Diller's home-shopping channel.
Last November, as QVC shares traded in the $50-and-up range, BellSouth had agreed to pay $60 a share for about 8.3 million new shares, or roughly a 12% stake, getting two seats on the QVC board.
But QVC's stock price has hovered down in the low $40 range for much of the time since, closing yesterday at $40.125, down 37.5 cents, or 0.9%, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
QVC's nose dive has been helped along by a less-than-stellar fourth-quarter performance and ballooning costs of launching TV-shopping services in Latin America and the United Kingdom, said Craig Bibb, a cable analyst for PaineWebber Inc.
If BellSouth were paying market value for QVC's stock today, its half-billion-dollar investment would entitle it to acquire nearly 12.5 million shares and upward of a 16% stake, although it isn't at all clear that Mr. Diller would be open to such an option.
Revising the terms wouldn't be as critical an issue if QVC's share price rose enough by BellSouth's do-or-die August deadline, but PaineWebber's Mr. Bibb believes it could take a year for QVC stock to hit $60.
People familiar with the deal also expect the Baby Bell to push to link an investment to a successful effort by QVC to take over another programming property, such as a Hollywood studio or another cable channel.
Earle Mauldin, BellSouth's chief financial officer, said in an interview that it is too early to say whether BellSouth will proceed with its option to invest in QVC.
But he indicated that the Baby Bell, known as a tight-fisted negotiator, wouldn't be willing to pay a premium for QVC as it stands today.
"Obviously, when the option is at $60 and QVC is selling in the low $40s, we would have a value question as we approach the expiration date of that option," Mr. Mauldin said.
"You don't have to be a rocket scientist" to figure that out, he added.
BellSouth's ultimate clout in pushing for any changes would be the threat of pulling out altogether.
But BellSouth may have a hard time persuading QVC's Mr. Diller to go along with any changes.
With zero debt and $200 million in annual cash flow, QVC has enough clout to finance most cable acquisitions on its own, said PaineWebber's Mr. Bibb.
"QVC doesn't need their money unless they go after a major acquisition," he said.
Mr. Diller, for his part, said BellSouth hasn't told him of any plans to push for new terms.
"We haven't heard from them at all," he said in an interview.
Mr. Diller is said to be interested in making a run at MGM Studios, among other properties.
BellSouth's Mr. Mauldin won't comment on any such possibilities as they relate to BellSouth, saying only that "I don't see any reason we couldn't revisit" the terms.
"We could let it lapse, rediscuss the business relationship between the parties, or pay $60 for something that is selling for $45 because of what we believe will happen in the future," Mr. Mauldin said.
"It's too speculative to deduce what we might do right now."
He cautions, however, that a lot could happen between now and then to force BellSouth's hand.
"QVC's stock price could be back up to $60 by then," Mr. Mauldin says.
BellSouth has made it clear that it is keenly interested in acquiring major programming assets, and QVC offers up enviable prospects on that score. the telephone company had agreed last fall to invest as much as $1.5 billion to help QVC in its hostile bid for Paramount Communications Inc., almost solely because of the studio's motherlode of programming riches.
QVC ultimately lost the high-stakes tug-of-war for Paramount to Viacom Inc., leaving BellSouth with a fallback option to invest $500 million in QVC.
Some Wall Street analysts say the only question is exactly when the regional Bell company will push for new terms.
"Until something is signed in blood, everything is subject to renegotiation," said Jack Grubman, a partner at Salomon Brothers Inc.
