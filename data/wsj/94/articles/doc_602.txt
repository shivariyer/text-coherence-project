Financier George Soros has cashed out of a Minneapolis munitions maker after deciding its business was inconsistent with his charitable activities.
Mr. Soros said he sold his roughly 6% stake in Alliant Techsystems Inc., which makes weapons including tank ammunition, mines, torpedoes, cluster bombs and medium-caliber machine-gun rounds.
But Mr. Soros, who manages nearly $4 billion through the Quantum Fund and other investment vehicles, didn't sell the stock as an investment move, he said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
"Rather, Mr. Soros determined that maintaining Quantum's investment in the company was not compatible with his philanthropic and humanitarian activities," the filing said.
A spokesman for Mr. Soros declined to comment further.
An Alliant spokesman said the company's "large shareholders make profit decisions every day" and the company was "glad to have had him as a shareholder, and perhaps one day he will again be a shareholder."
The spokesman said the company hadn't seen the filing.
Mr. Soros, heavily involved in Eastern and Central European affairs, has donated millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to Bosnia and denounced the West's reluctance to help the former Yugoslavia.
Last week he announced $4 million of emergency aid for Macedonia.
The move away from Alliant may be connected with concern over the proliferation of land mines by people associated with Mr. Soros.
The president of Mr. Soros's Open Society Fund, Aryeh Neier, likened the use of mines to torture in a November New Yorker article that noted Soros's investment in Alliant.
Mr. Soros got rid of his Alliant position March 22, selling 613,457 common shares at prices ranging from $24.48 to $24.50 each, according to the filing.
The filing didn't say how much he paid for the shares.
