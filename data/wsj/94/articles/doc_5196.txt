United HealthCare Corp. continued its expansionist drive with a definitive pact to acquire Ramsay-HMO Inc. for stock currently valued at $501 million.
Ramsay-HMO, based in Coral Gables, Fla., owns and operates a 172,000-member health-maintenance organization serving southern Florida.
United HealthCare, based in Minneapolis, is one of the nation's biggest managed-care organizations, operating a number of HMOs and preferred-provider organizations, among other activities.
Terms of the pact call for Ramsay holders to exchange each of their shares for 0.67 United HealthCare shares.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, United HealthCare closed down 62.5 cents to $85; at that price, the transaction's exchange ratio would give Ramsay holders stock valued at $55.95 for their shares.
After a midafternoon trading halt was lifted, Ramsay shares rocketed up $9.375, or 20%, to close at $55.25.
The transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests, United HealthCare said.
The company said it expects the transaction, which is subject to approval by regulators and by Ramsay stockholders, to close in mid-May.
United HealthCare clearly has embarked on a growth-through-acquisition strategy.
Early in 1993, it paid $100 million to acquire closely held Western Ohio Health Care Corp., and later last year issued shares then valued at about $386 million to acquire HMO America Inc. of Chicago.
More recently, it agreed to acquire closely held Complete Health Services Inc. of Alabama in exchange for shares currently valued at $214 million.
Last month, it also acquired a 350-employee Tennessee medical and disability management concern; terms weren't disclosed.
Published reports have indicated it has made overtures to acquire TakeCare Inc. of Concord, Calif. -- which recently spurned an $800 million bid from another suitor -- but a United HealthCare spokeswoman declined to comment yesterday on that issue.
Excluding acquisitions not yet closed, membership in the health plans United HealthCare owns increased 87% to 1.5 million in the 12 months ended Jan. 31; enrollment in the plans it owns and manages was 2.54 million, up from 1.77 million.
United HealthCare's shares, bolstered by investors' conviction that HMOs will benefit under the Clinton administration's planned health-care cost controls, have more than doubled from their $40-a-share level of a year ago.
United HealthCare said it considers the southeastern U.S. an attractive area for expansion, in part because the region hasn't been penetrated by managed-care services to the extent that some other areas have.
For the six months ended Dec. 31, Ramsay-HMO's net rose 55% to $7.7 million, or 98 cents a share, on revenue that increased 33% to $165.8 million.
