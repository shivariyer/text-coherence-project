Electronic Data Systems Corp. struck a deal to electronically link tens of thousands of coin-operated arcade games throughout North America.
If an initial test project succeeds, video-game players in one state or province will be able to compete against their counterparts across the continent, according to EDS and the Chicago-based Amusement and Music Operators Association.
John Schumacher, executive vice president of the 1,700-member association, said the group envisions "virtual" tournaments, where players of electronic dart games, for example, could compete against each other.
EDS reached the 10-year deal, whose terms weren't disclosed, with National Amusement Network Inc., a joint venture of the trade organization and Canada's TVphone Inc.
A spokeswoman for EDS, a unit of General Motors Corp., said the computer-services concern will be paid according to the number of people who play the hooked-up games.
Officials said they expect as many as 100,000 game terminals throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico to be linked within five years.
For EDS, which will provide the networking and computer hardware expertise, the plan is further proof of a shift in focus.
The company, a leader in the corporate computer business, has in the past year moved to become a force in the growing consumer market for multimedia products and services.
Earlier this year, EDS said it bought a 31.7% stake in an electronic-banking system in Europe and last year it announced plans to work with SPI Holding Inc. to provide on-demand videos to hotel rooms.
EDS, meantime, remains in the running for a $4 billion computer-services contract from Xerox Corp., expected to be announced later this year.
