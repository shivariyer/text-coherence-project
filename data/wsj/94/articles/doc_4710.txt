Three investment bankers left Kidder, Peabody & Co.'s Chicago office to join Robert W. Baird & Co.'s Chicago operation.
Baird, a brokerage house that is 80%-owned by Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., said the additions mark a "major expansion of its investment banking and principal investment activities."
Among the defectors from Kidder's Chicago office is Paul E. Purcell, 47 years old, who headed the General Electric Co. unit's Midwest investment banking activities for the past seven years.
Mr. Purcell, who had been a managing director at Kidder, was named head of Baird's mergers and acquisitions group, a newly created position that Baird said underscores the growth of the operation.
Mr. Purcell was with the company for 22 years; he'll head a staff whose size hasn't been determined, but will begin at five people, Baird's M&A group.
Paul J. Carbone, 32, former senior vice president at Kidder and a 10-year veteran there, will work with Mr. Purcell.
Steven G. Booth, a 33-year-old Kidder vice president, also moved with Mr. Purcell to Baird.
Baird noted that it has "significantly increased" its investment banking and M&A activity in recent years, and last year raised $4.3 billion in equity and debt capital for corporations, municipalities, schools and nonprofit organizations.
