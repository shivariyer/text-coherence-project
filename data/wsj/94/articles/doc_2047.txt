The U.S. sales arm of Tokyo-based Nissan Motor Co. said it settled a classaction lawsuit filed by owners of fire-prone Nissan vans in Texas, which increases to $1,000 the amount of money van owners can receive toward the purchase or lease of another Nissan vehicle.

U.S.A. said the agreement gives owners of 1987 to 1990 Nissan vans, code-named C-22, a $1,000 coupon that also may be used by a spouse, parent or child.
Van owners may opt to receive a $750 coupon that can be sold to anyone.
The coupon, which expires in March 1995, could cost Nissan $30 million if every Nissan van owner cashes in.
Nissan said it will begin notifying van owners of the larger coupon by mail this week.
The settlement replaces a settlement reached in California last month, which would have given van owners a $500 coupon toward another Nissan car or truck.
Nissan in February said it will buy back all of the estimated 33,000 Nissan vans it sold from 1987 to 1990 because of potential engine fires.
