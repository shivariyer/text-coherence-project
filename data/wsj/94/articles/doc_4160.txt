Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said he supports irradiation as a means of improving food safety and will ask the Food and Drug Administration to approve the process for beef.
"Concerns do exist on aspects of consumer confidence and worker safety," said Steve Kinsella, the Agriculture Department's press secretary.
"But clearly, irradiation is worth taking a look at."
In irradiation, the meat will be exposed to low levels of radiation to kill pathogens such as the E. coli bacteria.
Although the process is already used in fruits and poultry, consumer acceptance has been slow.
An FDA review of the process could take at least 18 months.
