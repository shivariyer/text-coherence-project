J.C. PENNEY Co. raised its quarterly dividend 17% and approved the repurchase of as much as $573 million in common stock.
The new dividend of 42 cents a share, up from 36 cents, is payable May 1 to stock of record April 8.
Penney, of Plano, Texas, said the buyback of as many as 10 million shares is intended to offset the issuance of common stock under the company's equity compensation plans.
Under those plans, the retailer issued 1.3 million shares in 1993 and 1.5 million shares the year before.
Penney had about 261 million fully diluted shares outstanding as of Jan. 31.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Penney shares closed at $57.25, unchanged.
