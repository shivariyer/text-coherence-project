Citicorp named Pei-yuan Chia, 54 years old, a vice chairman of the banking company, bringing the number of vice chairmen to four.
The move was not surprising given Mr. Chia's role as the bank's senior executive responsible for consumer banking.
Mr. Chia, a director of Citicorp and Citibank since April 1993, is one of six members of the management committee, the company's senior policy body.
He has been with the company for 20 years and was one of a group of marketing executives hired from General Foods Corp. to help build a consumer/credit card operation.
The Hong Kong native, who comes from a prominent Shanghai banking family, has oversight responsibility for Citibank's global consumer businesses in more than 40 countries and for Citibank's corporate banking activities in Asia, Citicorp said.
Mr. Chia earned his bachelor's degree in economics from Taiwan's Tunghai University and a master's in business administration from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
