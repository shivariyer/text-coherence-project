A key lawmaker on telecommunications issues said he'll try to free utility companies to compete more easily with telephone companies and cable operators.
At a House subcommittee hearing, Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.) said he'll try to amend a bill he sponsored with Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.) that would eliminate some barriers to competition for telephone and video service.
In its current form, the bill would permit some utilities to compete in those markets.
But others that operate as part of multistate utility-holding companies would remain restricted under provisions of the Public Utilities Holding Company Act.
Mr. Boucher's amendment would remove those restrictions, which affect utilities servicing 30% of Americans.
The move comes as administration officials are increasingly citing electric utilities as a potential new source of competition to cable and phone companies, many of which are joining forces.
Utilities often install fiber-optic lines along with their power lines, for their own internal communications, and lease some of the lines to telephone companies.
Under the Clinton administration's telecommunications proposals, detailed in a "white paper" released yesterday, utilities and other new telecommunications providers could be protected from state and local rate regulation.
The states could petition the Federal Communications Commission to regain control over the rates.
While some large utilities are pushing to provide telecommunications services directly to customers, others simply want to protect their lease arrangements from regulation, said Charles Meehan, executive director of the Utilities Telecommunications Council.
