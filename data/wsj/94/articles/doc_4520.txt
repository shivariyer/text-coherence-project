Washington Energy Co. said holders sued it in federal court in Seattle, charging it with misleading investors.
The company also said fourth-quarter earnings fell 39%.
Last year, state regulators ordered the company to cut electricity rates 5%, or $15.4 million, several months after the company filed for an increase.
Washington Energy stock, which traded as high as $26 a share last year, has slipped since, closing yesterday at $17.75, up 12.5 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
Washington Energy said the suit alleges it didn't properly disclose the potential risk associated with its rate request.
Plaintiffs and their attorneys couldn't be reached to comment.
The company said it "strongly denies" violating any laws.
Fourth-quarter net fell to $8.3 million, or 33 cents a share, from year-earlier net of $13.6 million, or 60 cents a share.
