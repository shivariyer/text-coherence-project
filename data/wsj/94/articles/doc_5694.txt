The Province of Ontario agreed to drop basketball from its sports-betting lottery, clearing the way for a National Basketball Association franchise in Toronto.
To make up for the province's lost gambling revenue, the NBA and the new franchise agreed to make various contributions to charitable causes similar to those that got funds from the lottery.
Plans for a professional basketball team in Toronto had been endangered because the NBA won't permit franchises in areas where betting on basketball is legal, and the provincial government didn't want to give up its sports-betting revenue.
The new team, which hasn't yet been named, is to begin playing in 1995.
Basketball will be dropped from the province's Pro-Line lottery on Oct. 1, 1995, according to the agreement.
The team will contribute five million Canadian dollars (US$3.7 million) over three years to a new charitable foundation and raise C$1 million annually thereafter through such things as exhibition games.
The NBA will contribute C$1.5 million to Ontario hospitals and provide C$2 million in TV time and ad space over four years to promote tourism in Ontario.
