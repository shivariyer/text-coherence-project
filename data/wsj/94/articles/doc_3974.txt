The U.S. is considering blocking imports of certain French products, with cheese at the top of the list, according to U.S. diplomats here, unless Paris relaxes the strict border controls it slapped on foreign fish earlier this month following violent riots by French fishermen.
"Our patience is wearing thin.
We are actively considering what measures to take," said a U.S. diplomat who asked not to be identified.
The U.S. exports an estimated $100 million of fresh and frozen fish to France each year.
According to U.S. fish exporters, the French government's sudden decision on Feb. 5 to run rigorous and lengthy health tests on fresh fish from outside the European Union resulted in shipments of American fish rotting in containers at Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport.
Fish from Norway and Senegal was also affected.
Since then, the French authorities have closed that airport to incoming shipments of fish, forcing most U.S. fish exporters to rerout their shipments for France to other European airports.
A spokeswoman for the French Farm and Fishing Ministry played down any connection between the riots in early February and the clampdown on non-EU fish imports.
Charles de Gaulle airport "was closed for fish imports in early February because it did not meet the necessary sanitary conditions," she said.
