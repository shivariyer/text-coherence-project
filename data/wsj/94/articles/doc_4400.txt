The federal government reported a budget surplus of $15.61 billion in January, down from a $29.82 billion surplus in January 1993.
There was a $8.25 billion deficit in December.
Analysts said the year-to-year drop reflects a calendar quirk in which Social Security benefits for January 1993 were actually paid out in December 1992, which helped to fatten the January surplus last year.
In its monthly statement, the Treasury said receipts totaled $122.97 billion last month, compared with $112.71 billion a year earlier and $125.42 billion in the previous month.
Outlays totaled $107.36 billion last month, compared with $82.90 billion a year earlier and $133.67 billion the month before.
For the first four months of the fiscal year, which started Oct. 1, the total deficit was $76.44 billion, compared with $90.65 billion during the year-earlier period.
Kathleen Stephansen, federal budget analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, says the deficit outlook is very encouraging.
She said that the economic recovery is playing a part, since receipts are rising and unemployment outlays are declining, but that deficit reduction laws are also responsible.
The government paid $17.90 billion in interest last month on the federal debt, down from $52.70 billion in December.

Receipts from Resolution Trust Corp. totaled $74 million last month, as it once again began selling off assets of failed thrifts under renewed authority from Congress.
