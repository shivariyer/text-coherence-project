Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's seven-year Iran-contra probe finally ended yesterday with the release of a 566-page report that charged the Reagan White House "covered up" the scandal.
It remains to be seen whether the Walsh prosecution in fact surfaced anything significant that hasn't already been reported by the Tower Commission or Congressional hearings in 1987.
Nonetheless, tax-payers paid dearly for the Walsh marathon.
He spent at least $37 million on research, lawyers and often questionable expenses.
That breaks down to $65,371 for every one of the 566 pages in his final report.
Assuming 250 words a page, his report cost an eye-popping $2,615 a word.
A new standard, no doubt, for running the meter on a litigation idling in park.
