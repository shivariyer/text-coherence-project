Union Bank of Switzerland, Zurich, said Friday its 1993 group net income soared 69% to 2.268 billion Swiss francs ($1.58 billion) from 1.343 billion francs a year earlier.
The bank also said it plans to raise its dividend on 1993 earnings, which rose in line with forecasts.
The company said it doesn't foresee a similar profit rise for 1994.
UBS's cash flow rose 41% in 1993 to 4.507 billion francs from 3.191 billion francs in 1992, while assets rose 17% to 311.3 billion francs from 266.7 billion francs in 1992.
The company said the dividend will increase 3 francs a bearer share to 32 francs and 60 centimes a registered share to 6.40 francs.
It also plans subscription rights equal to about 13.40 francs a bearer share and 3.45 francs a registered share.
The bank said the rights aren't a capital increase, but are meant to acknowledge its extraordinary success last year.
Meanwhile, the company said that provisions in 1993 reached a record 2.231 billion francs, but that in 1994, provisioning needs should decline.
