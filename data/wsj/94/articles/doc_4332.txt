Decora Industries Inc., Fort Edward, N.Y., said it signed a manufacturing and distribution agreement with Rubbermaid Inc., its major customer, through March 31, 1999.
The terms weren't disclosed, but Decora, a maker of consumer and industrial coating and adhesive products, said that in recent years, sales to Rubbermaid, Wooster, Ohio, have accounted for more than two-thirds of its consolidated revenue.
Net income for Decora for the nine months ended Dec. 31 totaled $1.3 million.
Revenue was $38.3 million.
Under the terms of an original agreement signed in April 1990, Decora produces its Con-Tact covering material exclusively for Rubbermaid.
The new agreement, Decora said, "solidifies the ongoing joint efforts of both Rubbermaid and Decora to expand revenues beyond the basic domestic sales of Con-Tact."
