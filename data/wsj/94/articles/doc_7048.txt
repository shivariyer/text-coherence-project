Reebok International Ltd., sidestepping a sharp decline in U.S. footwear sales, posted fourth-quarter net income of $50.7 million or 59 cents a share, compared with operating profit of $49.8 million a year earlier.
The 1992 fourth-quarter results included a charge from asset sales, yielding a net loss of $67.7 million, or 74 cents a share.
Revenue fell to $602.6 million in the latest quarter, compared with $660 million a year earlier.
Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive of the Stoughton, Mass., company, attributed the decline in part to a 23% drop in U.S. footwear sales.
