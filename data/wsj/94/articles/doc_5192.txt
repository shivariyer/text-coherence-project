Japan's Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co. and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group are forming a petrochemical joint venture in Singapore, a spokesman for the Japanese firm said.
The partners plan to build a 310,000-ton-a-year styrene-monomer unit and a 140,000-ton-a-year propylene-oxide unit on Seraya Island off the coast of Singapore.
The cost of the project is estimated at 51 billion yen ($497.3 million).
Construction will start in March, with the completion targeted for the spring of 1997.
The Shell group has a 70% stake in the Seraya Chemicals Singapore Pte. Ltd., while Mitsubishi holds 30%.
