Caterpillar Inc. said it plans to build diesel engines in China through a joint venture pact with Shanghai Diesel Engine Co., China's leading diesel engine maker.
Terms of the joint venture, the Peoria, Ill., company's first manufacturing partnership with a Chinese firm, weren't disclosed, but Caterpillar will have a 55% stake and contribute technological expertise as well as cash.
The engines will be sold throughout China.
Caterpillar sells about $3.7 billion of engines annually world-wide.
