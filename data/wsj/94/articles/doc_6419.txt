Centex Corp. said it plans to sell a 51% stake in its construction products subsidiary through an initial public offering that is expected to raise as much as $173.4 million.
Centex, one of the nation's largest home builders, said it will use proceeds to reduce debt.
The unit, Centex Construction Products Inc., makes cement, ready-mix concrete and gypsum wallboard.
Centex Corp. said the move is designed to make it easier for the construction products operation to raise capital and make acquisitions.
"We like the business and we want to expand it," said Laurence E. Hirsch, Centex Corp.'s chairman and chief executive.
The cash infusion, meanwhile, will help protect Centex Corp. against a possible downturn in the real estate market, Mr. Hirsch said.
While the company has been riding high because of low interest rates and the housing rebound, "We're in the real estate business and preparing for cycles," he said.
Centex Construction Products has benefited of late from higher cement and gypsum prices, and the unit's loss-plagued New Mexico gypsum operation is now profitable, analysts said.
"It's a business that turned the corner about a year ago," said Lawrence J. Horan of Prudential Securities Research Inc.
Current management will continue to run Centex Construction Products, the company said, and Mr. Hirsch will be chairman of the affiliate.
The initial public offering of 10.2 million shares, expected to be priced between $15 and $17 a share, will be managed by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., Dillon Read & Co. and Lehman Brothers.
