Securities and Exchange Commissioner Richard Roberts suggested that political influence-peddling has helped make negotiated sales of municipal bonds more prevalent than competitive sales.
Noting that the bulk of munis were sold competitively 20 years ago but that negotiated underwritings now account for much of the market, Mr. Roberts said that some of the reasons for this reversal "may not be positive."
In a speech to the National Economists Club, Mr. Roberts said pointedly that one reason for the current dominance of negotiated sales "may be the increase in political influence-peddling in the municipal-securities marketplace and the fact that an issuer is more easily able to control a negotiated transaction."
Mr. Roberts said a municipal-bond disclosure package to be considered by the SEC at an open meeting today will address the influence-peddling problem by making it clear that issuers must disclose any relationships material to the selection of finance professionals.
