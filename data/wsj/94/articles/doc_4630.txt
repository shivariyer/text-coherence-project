Ciba-Geigy AG, the large Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, said its additives division reached an agreement to set up its first joint-venture operation in China.
The new company, Shanghai Ciba GaoQiao Chemical Co., will be built in Pudong in Shanghai.
The other partners in the venture are China's Shanghai Gao Qiao Petrochemical Co. and Japan's Nippon Alkyl Phenol Co., Tokyo.
Ciba will control 58.5% of the joint-venture company, both directly and through its holdings in Nippon Alkyl Phenol, the Swiss company said.
Ciba said its total investment in the project, including planned expansions, will be about $30 million.
The new plant, which will employ about 150 people, is expected to begin operations in 1997.
The plant will produce two of Ciba's plastic stabilizers, Irganox 1010/1076 and Irgafos 168, as well as the intermediate substances required to produce them.
Raw materials for the production will be purchased locally, Ciba said.
"Until now, our products have been imported into China and supplied to endusers with the help of our liaison offices in Beijing and Shanghai," Klaus Grundmann, head of Ciba's additives division, said.
"With this joint venture, we will be able to manufacture our two most important products for China in China."
Mr. Grundmann added that being able to produce locally would give Ciba a competitive advantage.
Although the joint venture is the first in China for Ciba's additives division, the Swiss company's six other divisions are already present in the country.
Ciba is active in China in several ventures, including in the areas of electronic scales -- through Mettler Toledo -- animal health, pharmaceuticals, contact lenses, plant protection and pigments.
