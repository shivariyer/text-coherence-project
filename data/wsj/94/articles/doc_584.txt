Grumman Corp. directors said they are taking "no position at this time" on Northrop Corp.'s unfriendly acquisition bid of $60 a share, or $2.04 billion.
The Grumman decision, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, leaves the door open to another bid by Martin Marietta Corp., which had earlier offered $55 a share, or $1.93 billion, in a negotiated buyout agreement with Grumman, a defense-electronics concern and builder of tactical aircraft.
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Grumman shares closed at $63.25, up 25 cents.
The tender offer by Martin Marietta, a Bethesda, Md., aerospace and electronics concern, expires next Monday.
The offer by Los Angeles-based Northrop expires April 8.
Some analysts believe Martin Marietta may decide to walk away from a bidding war for Grumman.
One possibility some cite is that Martin Marietta, in league with other companies, might try to buy out Northrop later, after it has absorbed Grumman.
Northrop produces military aircraft, commercial-aircraft components and defense-electronics systems.
The Grumman directors' decision late Thursday to take no position on the Northrop bid followed a series of telephone calls between the companies, according to the SEC filing.
Grumman said the move reflected its inability to "predict what bids or revisions to bids" may arise.
Earlier, the Grumman board had authorized limited talks with Northrop to clarify its merger offer.
Not taking a position also allows the Grumman board to avoid for now any penalties it might have to pay Martin Marietta if the earlier merger agreement ends.
At most, Grumman could owe $58.8 million in fees and expenses to Martin Marietta, although the matter would likely be a source of disagreement.
