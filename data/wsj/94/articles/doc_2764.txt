QVC Inc. reported a sharp decline in profit for the fiscal fourth quarter, partly reflecting an after-tax charge of $18.8 million for expenses related to its failed bid for Paramount Communications Inc.
The television home-shopping company said profit was $2.8 million, or six cents a share, on a fully diluted basis for the quarter ended Jan. 31.
Profit a year ago was $18.9 million, or 40 cents a share, also on a fully diluted basis.
In addition to the $18.8 million charge related to Paramount, QVC also incurred $7.4 million in after-tax losses for the launch of joint ventures in the U.K. and Mexico.
Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive of QVC, said that while the company had been "distracted while pursuing Paramount," the company's core business was strong and it has had aggressive plans to expand current operations.
Operating income rose 35% to $53.2 million from $39.5 million in the quarter.
Revenue increased 9% to $372.5 million from $341.8 million.
According to a spokesman, QVC's services added about three million homes to its home-shopping subscriber base for the year ended Jan. 31; QVC's services are now available in 50 million homes.
