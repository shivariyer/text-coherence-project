Noble Affiliates Inc., Ardmore, Okla., said fourth-quarter charges relating to adjustments on several fields means the company will report net income for the period "at or near a break-even level."
In the year-earlier quarter, Noble Affiliates had net income of $8 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $76.8 million.
The independent energy company said it expected that the noncash charges will be $11.7 million.
They include a noncash pretax charge of $4 million from the downward revision of about three million barrels of proved, undeveloped reserves associated with the company's interest in the San Miguel prospect offshore California.
The company also said it is adding $4.7 million pretax to its fourth-quarter depreciation, depletion and amortization expense to reduce its investment in the Camar field offshore Indonesia because of a recent drop in daily production.
