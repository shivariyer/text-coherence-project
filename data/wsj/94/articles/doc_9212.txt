Motorola Inc., citing growing sales across its major product lines due to increased international investment as the economies expand, reported an 88% increase in fourth-quarter net income.
Profit was $340 million, or $1.15 a share, compared with $181 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier.
The earnings were at the high end of financial analysts' expectations, which ranged from 93 cents to $1.15 a share, according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
Motorola attributed the results to a 35% growth in total sales for the quarter to $4.99 billion from $3.71 billion a year earlier.
For the year, Motorola's net more than doubled to $1.02 billion, or $3.55 a share, from $453 million, or $1.66 a share, in 1992.
Sales in 1993 were $16.96 billion, compared with $13.30 billion in 1992.
Semiconductor sales for 1993 rose 28% to $5.70 billion from $4.48 billion, with strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
Sales in its general-systems sector, which includes cellular phones, grew 43% to $5.24 billion from $3.66 billion.
Sales in Motorola's communications sector, which includes such products as mobile-radio equipment and pagers, grew 24% to $4.83 billion in 1993 from $3.91 billion a year earlier.
Sales in its government and systems technology group grew 32% to $858 million from $650 million.
In a statement, Gary Tooker, Motorola's chief executive officer, said the company expects steady growth in North America, as well as growth in new markets such as China, and in Europe and Japan.
