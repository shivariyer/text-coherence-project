Program trading in the week ended Jan. 21 accounted for 12.6%, or an average 37.9 million daily shares, of New York Stock Exchange volume.
This included program trading related to the Jan. 21 monthly expiration of stock-index options and futures.
Brokerage firms executed an additional 21.8 million daily shares of program trading away from the Big Board, mostly on foreign markets.
Program trading is the simultaneous purchase or sale of at least 15 different stocks with a total value of $1 million or more.
Of the program total on the Big Board, 39% involved stock-index arbitrage, up from 33.5% the prior week.
In this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
Some 51.8% of program trading was executed by firms for their own accounts, or principal trading, while 38.2% was for their customers.
An additional 10% was designated as customer facilitation, where firms use principal positions to facilitate customer trades.
Of the five most-active firms, Nomura Securities, UBS Securities and Susquehanna executed all or most of their program trading for their own accounts, while Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney did most of their trading for their customers.
