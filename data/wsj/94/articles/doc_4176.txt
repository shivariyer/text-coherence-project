Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders labeled smoking an adolescent addiction and accused the tobacco industry of trying to convince teenagers that cigarettes will make them sexy and successful.
Dr. Elders, unveiling the latest surgeon general's report on smoking, also urged the Federal Trade Commission to draw the curtain on R.J. Reynolds Tobacco's Joe Camel cartoon ads.
"Smoking is not just an adult habit.
It is an adolescent addiction," said Dr. Elders.
She said teenagers who smoke run higher risks of experimenting with alcohol and drugs, doing poorly in school, fighting, engaging in unsafe sex and even attempting suicide.
Her report, compiled by government scientists and academic researchers, said the average age when smokers tried their first cigarette is 14.5 years, and more than 70% of those who become daily smokers acquired that habit by age 18.
R.J. Reynolds said that peer influence and parental example "are the reasons why youth smoke, not advertising."
Dr. Elders said she "probably will" talk to President Clinton about the need for tougher action.
