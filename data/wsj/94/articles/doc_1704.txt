Allen Group Inc. expects sizable gains in sales and pretax profit this year, but a sharply higher tax rate will result in lower earnings from continuing operations, said Robert G. Paul, president and chief executive officer.
Because the Beachwood, Ohio, producer of mobile communication equipment and truck parts exhausted its tax-loss carry-forwards during 1993, its combined federal and state income tax rate will rise to about 39% for 1994, from 11% last year, said Robert A. Youdelman, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Mr. Paul said that 1994 net could dip below $1 a share, but he declined to make a specific forecast.
In 1993 Allen had net income of $24.1 million, or 96 cents a share, after losses from discontinued operations, partially offset by a gain from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes.
