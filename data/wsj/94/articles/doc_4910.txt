High-flying video-game maker Sega Enterprises Ltd. said it expects earnings in the year ending March 31 to plunge, reflecting underlying weakness in the company's mainstay video-game markets.
Sega officials confirmed a report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun that the company's consolidated pretax profit will drop 62%, to 22 billion yen ($212 million) from 59.18 billion yen the year earlier.
The company also estimates an 8% decline in group sales, to 385 billion yen from 416.23 billion yen.
The bad news comes just days after market-research firms announced that Sega had decisively defeated rival Nintendo Co. in the key U.S. market for home video-game machines.
Sega blamed the revision on economic sluggishness in Europe and on the strong yen, which makes products exported from Japan more expensive overseas and lowers the yen-denominated value of overseas sales.
A company spokesman said Sega expects a recovery next year, thanks to plans to launch a line of new toys aimed at younger children and to open the first of its virtual-reality based theme parks in Japan.
Sega's downward revision follows a similar announcement several months ago by its main competitor, Nintendo of Kyoto.
During the past several years, both game makers consistently outperformed Japan's more traditional computer and consumer-electronics companies, thanks to their focus on generating profits from software, rather than from hardware.
Even as Sega revised its earnings downward, however, Sony Corp. reported earnings that suggested it may be back on the road to health.
Sega and Nintendo both hope to recapture the high ground with new game machines to be released over the next 12 months.
Analysts, however, have said that both companies will need to act to counter the erosion of their traditional reliance on game software-steps that Nintendo has been slower to make than has Sega.
