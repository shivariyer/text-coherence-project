P. Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive officer of Merck & Co., said the profitability of the pharmaceutical industry could be headed for trouble, but that Merck is well-positioned for the changes ahead.
"The profitability of the industry surely is decreasing.
Absolutely," Mr. Vagelos said in an interview at the big drug maker's Washington office.
"You can't look at it over one year, two years," he continued.
But by the year 2000, he said "the industry will be in bad shape."
However, Mr. Vagelos contended, "Merck will be in great shape, because we took all the right steps."
Merck is increasingly getting involved in managed care, particularly with its acquisition last year of Medco Containment Services Inc., a large managed-care pharmaceutical distributor, Mr. Vagelos said.
"We have figured out where the market is going," he said.
"As managed-care has developed among doctors and hospitals, it is developing on the pharmaceutical side.
And we're right in the middle of it."
Mr. Vagelos indicated that drug companies will fight the regulatory measures in President Clinton's health reform bill and other proposals.
"The thing that scares me the most and that I'm violently opposed to," he said, "is the possibility of a government agency, committee or somebody determining whether a breakthrough product we've worked on for 15 years is fairly priced.
I'd rather have the free market determine price."
Regardless of whether drug companies are squeezed by price controls or other cost-curbing measures under health-care reform legislation, Merck "will continue doing breakthrough research, no matter what," he said.
He said that the company's pioneering success in pharmaceutical managed care will enable it to fund such science.
