More than 536,000 Finns were out of work last month, a post-World War II jobless high of 21.8%, the Labor Ministry said.
In November, 20.3% of the work force was unemployed.
In December 1992, 17.9% of the Finnish work force was jobless, the ministry said.
Unemployment figures from the Labor Ministry aren't considered Finland's official unemployment rate.
Official figures for December, used in international comparisons, will be released in February by the Central Statistics Office.
Finland's official unemployment rate was 18.4% in November.
