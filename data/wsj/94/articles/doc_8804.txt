Your article about me on Jan. 12 ("Pankau, P.I.: Less Than Meets the Eye?") refers to statements Robert Pack has made about me.
I will refute those false, inaccurate and misleading statements.
Government records alone disprove some of the information contained in the article.
For example, I will furnish the court and the arbitration panel various military records that conclusively show that I was a member of the Special Forces, also known as the Green Berets, and that I had a distinguished military service record, contrary to the claims of Robert Pack and other sources.
Edmund J. Pankau
