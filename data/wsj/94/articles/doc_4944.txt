Crownx Inc. said it will record a writedown of 65 million Canadian dollars (US$48.1 million), or C$1.17 a Class A share, against its 1993 earnings as a result of the dilution of its investment in Crown Life Insurance Co.
Crownx, based in Markham, Ontario, said its stake in Crown Life will drop to 32.4% from 54% under the terms of an agreement reached with Crown Life's other major shareholder, Haro Financial Corp., a closely held investment concern based in Regina, Saskatchewan.
Haro's stake in the life insurance company will rise to 64.48% from 42%, Crownx said.
Public shareholders will continue to own the remainder of the shares.
The transactions are subject to final agreements and regulatory approval.
