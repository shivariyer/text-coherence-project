Stores and dairies may label milk as coming from cows not treated with a controversial new hormone, but the labels can't suggest the milk is any safer than that from treated animals, the Food and Drug Administration said.
In guidelines to be published today, the FDA said companies may label milk, ice cream and other dairy products as coming from "cows not treated with" recombinant bovine somatotropin, but that the information must be in "the proper context."
That means a label also must carry a statement like, "No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rbST-treated and non-rbST-treated cows," the agency said.
The genetically engineered version of the naturally occurring hormone went on the market Friday.
The drug makes cows produce more milk.
Some stores, dairies and food processors, worried about consumer response, have said they wouldn't carry products from treated animals.
Others have wanted to label products as coming from animals that hadn't been treated.
The agency said labels may not claim that milk is "bST-free" because the hormone occurs naturally in milk.
Labels also cannot say milk is "rBST-free" because that would imply the milk is different.
Critics of the hormone's use say it poses risks not yet thoroughly addressed.
They say cows that produce more milk also have a higher risk of udder infections that must be treated with antibiotics.
The FDA said the milk supply is tested against antibiotic residues already.
The agency is also supervising a program by the developer, Monsanto Co., to monitor the milk supply.
