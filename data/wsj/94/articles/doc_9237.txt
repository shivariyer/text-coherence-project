Brown Group Inc., St. Louis, said it will take a fourth-quarter charge of $50 million to cover costs to reduce its workforce and to close or consolidate operations.
The shoe and specialty-retailing company said it plans to consolidate its Brown Shoe Co. and Pagoda units; close more than 100 company-owned Regal and Connie shoe stores nationwide; and shut five shoe factories in Missouri and Tennessee.
The moves are part of a restructuring plan that will cut employment by 5,660 positions, or about 20%, Brown Group said.
When the moves are completed next year, the company said, it will have reduced costs by $40 million, while allowing it to focus on its most-promising businesses.
For the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, 1993, Brown Group posted net income of $9.1 million, or 53 cents a share, on sales of $449.8 million.
