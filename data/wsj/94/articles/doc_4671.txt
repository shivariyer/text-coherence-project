Sumitomo Corp., one of Japan's largest operators of cable-television stations, plans this year to expand its holdings of Japanese cable systems by nearly 50%.
Sumitomo plans to acquire equity stakes in six or seven cable systems across Japan by the end of the year, Yasushige Nishimura, deputy general manager of Sumitomo's media-business division, said in an interview.
Many of those stations will be in rural areas, Mr. Nishimura said.
The new acquisitions will be in addition to the 13 systems, mostly in the Tokyo and Osaka areas, in which Sumitomo now holds an interest.
The giant trading company has already invested $200 million to $300 million of debt and equity in its Japanese cable-system holdings; the additional stations will bring Sumitomo's total investment to roughly $400 million, Mr. Nishimura said.
On average, Sumitomo holds a 35% equity stake in its cable interests, Mr. Nishimura said.
In 10 of its 13 existing ventures, Sumitomo is the leading shareholder.
By the end of the year, Sumitomo hopes to be the leading shareholder in 13 or 14 of its stations.
So far, Mr. Nishimura said, the cable-television business has been a money-losing proposition for Sumitomo, although it has been growing in terms of subscribers and revenue by 35% to 40% a year.
Sumitomo expects its investments to be profitable by 1997, Mr. Nishimura said.
Sumitomo's push in Japan's cable market, a collection of roughly 200 independently-owned stations, is part of its plans to gain experience managing cable networks world-wide.
It has already formed a partnership with U.S. cable giant TeleCommunications Inc., which owns 35% of a Sumitomo cable-network programming company in Japan.
Sumitomo is also a partner with TCI in Intermedia Partners I and Intermedia Partners III, two U.S. ventures formed to acquire and manage local cable-television stations in the U.S.
