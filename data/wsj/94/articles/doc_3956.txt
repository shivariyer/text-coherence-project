Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its rating on general obligation bonds issued by this city.
About $3.5 million of uninsured general obligation debt was affected, Moody's said.
The rest of Troy's general obligation bonds are insured and are unaffected, Moody's said.
Moody's downgraded the bonds to single-Ba from single-Baa, citing deterioration in the city's finances.
Troy officials couldn't be reached for comment.
