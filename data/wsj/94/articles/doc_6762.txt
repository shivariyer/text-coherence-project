James M. Grout, 49 years old, was named president of Shoney's restaurant division.
Mr. Grout's previous position had been executive vice president for franchising and development for this restaurant company.
He fills a position that opened up 10 months ago when Steve Sanders, the former president, left to become a Shoney's franchisee.
James W. Arnett Jr., president and chief operating officer of the parent company, had assumed Mr. Sanders' duties in the interim.
