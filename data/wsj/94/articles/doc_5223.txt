Investors cast aside worries about the U.S.-Japanese trade tussle and bid stocks higher.
Bonds prices were mixed and the dollar ended higher.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 24.21 points to 3928.27.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.29 to 472.52, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rallied 4.67 to 790.12.
"The market did surprisingly well, given the trade-war talk between the U.S. and Japan," said David Shulman, stock strategist at Salomon Brothers.
On Monday, a dynamic stock-market rally faded as trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan escalated, sending the dollar plunging almost 4% against the yen.
Yesterday, after another nervous day of trading, the dollar recovered somewhat against the yen.
But Japanese stocks continued to get hammered.
The Nikkei Stock Average plunged 484.65 points, or 2.5%, to 18974.60 on Tuesday, bringing its loss so far this week to 5%.
Some analysts suggested that one of the reasons U.S. stocks, particularly economically sensitive shares, performed so well yesterday was the belief that a weaker dollar may benefit cyclical companies.
"As the dollar goes down, it only helps our exporters," said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at Natwest Securities.
What's more, a stronger yen gives some U.S. companies such as auto concerns the leeway to raise prices because it makes Japanese goods more expensive.
Mr. Canelo said he isn't particularly troubled by the rising tensions between the U.S. and Japan.
"I don't think the U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is real," he said.
"And even if it gets much worse, I feel it would have an impact on the dollar, but not on the stock market."
World-wide, stock prices dropped in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.74, to 116.18.
Stock prices rose.
Volume totaled 306.7 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,198 issues advanced and 882 declined.
