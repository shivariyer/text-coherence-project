KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said its underlying business grew strongly again in January.
The 38.2% state-owned Dutch flag carrier said total airline traffic grew 18% to 531.6 million ton kilometers from 450.9 million ton kilometers a year earlier.
KLM has been recording strong monthly growth in the volume of passengers and freight it carries.
But fare wars on crowded and fiercely competitive routes have sapped income.
A ton kilometer represents about 10 passengers or one metric ton of freight carried over one kilometer.
KLM also filled more of its available cargo and seating capacity in January.
Capacity utilization, or load factor, rose to 68.6% last month from 64.4%.
KLM said it swung to a profit of 15 million guilders ($7.7 million) in the fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31 from a net loss of 437 million guilders a year earlier.
Revenue rose 7.1% to 2.11 billion guilders.
Improved efficiency and steady outlays were among factors returning KLM to profit, although the main cause was over 300 million guilders of one-time charges in the year-earlier period.
KLM said its haulage of cargo, including mail, increased 18% to 235.8 million ton kilometers from the 199.0 million ton kilometers.
Passenger traffic rose 17% to 295.8 million ton kilometers from 251.9 million ton kilometers.
