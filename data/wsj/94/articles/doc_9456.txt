Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd. said its most significant overseas oil discovery may be bigger than previously thought.
The Calgary, Alberta, oil producer said an independent assessment of the oil reserves attributable to the Masila Block, Republic of Yemen, at Dec. 31, 1993, estimated the oil field's reserves at 546 million barrels.
It said the new estimate of 317 million barrels of proved reserves and 229 million barrels of probable reserves is 18% higher than a Dec. 31, 1992, estimate of the same oil field.
Canadian Occidental has a 52% interest in the Masila Block.
It said its estimated share of the block's oil reserves has risen to 284 million barrels from 241 million barrels.
