The European Union Commission said Ford Motor Co.'s agreement to raise its equity stake in Hertz Corp. from 49% to 54% doesn't fall under EU merger rules.
In a statement, the commission said it concluded the operation doesn't fall under the merger regulation because there will be no "significant change in the quality of decisive influence . . . exercised by Ford in the day-to-day business of Hertz."
To come within the scope of the merger rules, linkups must involve taking control.
Under EU merger rules, the Commission has the power to examine mergers and joint ventures between companies, inside and outside Europe, with combined world-wide sales of 5 billion European Currency Units ($5.6 billion) and EU sales of 250 million ECUs each, to ensure that they won't distort competition in the EU.
