Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. said it formed a venture, Private Fund Group, to raise private equity capital for domestic and international investment organizations.
The company said the venture, which complements its merchant-banking and high-yield businesses, is staffed by five executives in New York, Chicago and London, all of whom joined the firm recently from Merrill Lynch & Co.
Donaldson is a unit of Equitable Cos.
The group will concentrate on raising capital for investment organizations, funds and partnerships in a range of fields, including leveraged buyouts, real estate, venture capital, emerging markets and distressed securities.
The group also plans to arrange direct private placements of equity.
Its primary sources of capital will be pension funds, endowments, financial institutions and high-net-worth individuals, Donaldson said.
Philip Pool and Robert Rivett joined the company as managing directors, jointly heading the venture.
Raymond Cosman, Chad Schultz and Richard Hill joined the company as senior vice presidents.
The company said the five were involved in the origination and distribution of private equity investment products at Merrill Lynch.
