The Senate Banking Committee voted to confirm Ricki Tigert as chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., despite Republican efforts to use her nomination to raise questions about President Clinton's and Hillary Rodham Clinton's connection with a failed thrift.
Ms. Tigert, a lawyer in the Washington office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, this week removed herself from consideration of matters concerning the Clintons' business and political activities.
Ms. Tigert describes herself as a "casual" acquaintance of the Clintons.
The FDIC is tangentially involved in looking at the circumstances surrounding the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which has been linked to the Clintons' personal and political finances.
The nomination cleared the panel on a 16-1 vote, despite a statement by Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R., N.C.) that "the chairmanship of the FDIC is not a place to put another Clinton personal friend."
He was the sole dissenting vote.
The size of the margin indicates that Ms. Tigert will win confirmation from the full Senate, although consideration of her nomination will give the GOP another opportunity to raise Madison Guaranty.
A special counsel is investigating the matter.
The panel also cleared the nomination of Andrew Hove, now acting chairman of the FDIC, to a second five-year term as the agency's vice chairman, and the nomination of Anne Hall, a vice president of Banc One Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, to the five-member FDIC board.
