Most of the top executives at the New York Times Co. had their bonuses cut in 1993, while the company signed a lucrative compensation pact with the chairman of the Boston Globe's parent company acquired last year.
According to the proxy statement for the media company's 1994 annual meeting, the annual bonus of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive officer, decreased 35% in 1993, to $384,560.
The company said the bonus is partially tied to financial performance targets.
However, Mr. Sulzberger's base salary was raised 3.5% to $515,000 last year, because of his role in negotiating the acquisition of the Globe and his leadership "in a difficult economic climate," the company said.
For 1993, New York Times Co.'s operating profit improved 43% on revenue of $2.02 billion, up about 14% from 1992.
A similar pattern was followed for most of the other top officers, including President Lance R. Primis, whose bonus fell about 13% to $265,760; and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., publisher of the company's New York Times flagship paper, whose bonus fell 46%, to $194,089.
The exception was Chief Financial Officer David L. Gorham, whose salary rose 4.4% while his bonus increased 6.4%, the company said, "in recognition of his role in connection with the negotiation and completion" of the Globe deal.
Under its agreement to acquire Affiliated Publications Inc., parent of the Globe, last October, New York Times Co. agreed to employ William O. Taylor, Affiliated's chairman and chief executive officer, until Dec. 31, 1998.
During that time, Mr. Taylor is to receive his current salary and benefits, "as adjusted in the ordinary course."
If he is fired, New York Times Co. agreed to continue to pay him a salary and benefits based on a certain formula.
A spokesman for the New York Times said the company isn't required to disclose Mr. Taylor's salary because "he isn't in the top five."
