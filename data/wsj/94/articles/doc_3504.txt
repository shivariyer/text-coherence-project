The War of the Roses seems to have erupted in Arkansas, with the Washington Post reporting that the Rose Law Firm is investigating billing irregularities by former partner Webster Hubbell, now associate attorney general and (well, you know the rest).
The Justice Department yesterday issued Mr. Hubbell's statement declaring, "I did not overbill the RTC or other clients," and assuring curiosity-seekers that the inquiry is "in no way out of the ordinary."
Over at the White House, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers described President Clinton's reaction: "He stands by Webb."
She said Chief of Staff Mack McLarty had questioned Hubbell about the report and "received assurances from Webb that it wasn't true and the President is satisfied by that."
