Riot victim Reginald O. Denny's civil lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles and several top police officials, has been reinstated and allowed to go forward.
U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. overruled motions by lawyers for the city of Los Angeles, former police chief Daryl Gates, and others, which had asked that the case be thrown out for the second time.
Late last year, the judge dismissed Mr. Denny's claims, along with those of three other riot beating victims, but allowed them to amend their legal theories and present supporting facts more fully.
The other plaintiffs' suits also were revived.
Experts had been doubtful of the legal strength of Mr. Denny's case because cities generally have no duty to protect citizens from crimes.
The plaintiff's lawyers say they survived the dismissal motion because they convinced Judge Byrne that once a city agrees to provide police services, it cannot do so in a discriminatory fashion.
Mr. Denny, and the other plaintiffs, claim they were beaten because Mr. Gates and others deliberately failed to provide police support in black neighborhoods.
