The New York Stock Exchange said trading in CCX Inc.'s common and 5% cumulative, preferred stock was suspended yesterday.
The Big Board said it would apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the stock, traded under the symbols CCX and CCX Pr, respectively.
The exchange said CCX, a Charlotte, N.C.-based maker of meshes for screening and filtration, fell below listing criteria.
The Big Board cited rules including a minimum $5 million in aggregate market value of publicly held shares and a minimum of $8 million in net tangible assets available to common stock in conjunction with at least $600,000 in three-year average net income.
On Feb. 23, CCX announced it was in restructuring negotiations with its bank and bondholders.
The company said it might be required to file a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
A company spokeswoman said CCX didn't dispute falling below Big Board criteria.
