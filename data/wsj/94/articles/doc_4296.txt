The New York Stock Exchange said it fined Smith Barney Shearson Inc. $50,000 for failing to promptly report records of violations, consumer complaints and terminations that were kept on its brokers.
Smith Barney, the brokerage unit of Travelers Inc., consented without admitting or denying guilt to findings that it violated exchange reporting requirements and failed to maintain procedures for supervising its reporting obligations.
The Big Board said it also imposed a requirement that Smith Barney implement policies and procedures to "reasonably ensure" prompt reporting.
It said the firm also consented to conduct an internal review within six months to determine whether it has reported everything that it is required on the forms, designated U-5 and RE-3.
A Smith Barney spokesman said the company had taken steps "much prior" to the Big Board announcement to streamline reporting procedures.
The disciplinary action comes at a time when securities brokerage firms have been trying to polish their public image by toughening reporting standards.
At the end of last year, securities executives and the National Association of Securities Dealers were beginning to overhaul the industry's U-5 forms to require firms to provide more information, such as specifics on why a broker left.
The NYSE said its hearing panel found that between July 1992 and June 1993, Smith Barney filed 43 amended U-5 and three RE-3 forms that didn't promptly report 61 reportable matters concerning 44 former or present employees.
