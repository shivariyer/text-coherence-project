In our Feb. 11 letter on Repetitive Strain Injury, a typographical error distorted an important point.
We wrote, "Like athletes, employees must keep their upper bodies fit to work at the keyboard" (not "just keep").
Indeed, we wish computer users would keep their upper bodies fit.
Most of them don't, which is part of the reason they get injured.
