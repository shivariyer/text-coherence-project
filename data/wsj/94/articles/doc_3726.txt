A sobering report on German labor costs and doubts about a 1994 recovery show why German employers are resisting union wage demands, strikes or no strikes.
Germans worked fewer hours -- and wages rose faster and higher -- than in any other of the world's major economies since 1985, according to a study released Tuesday by the Federal Statistics Office.
Its findings helped support industry claims that German manufacturing would die out or shift abroad unless unions agree to lower labor costs.
Workers' real hourly wages under union contracts in western Germany rose 23% from 1985 through October 1993, nearly double the net 12% gain in industrial output over the same period.
In Europe, the wage jump compares with rises of 6.1% in France and the Netherlands and an increase of 5.3% in Italy, and, more dramatically, a decline of 8.5% in real wages for the period in the U.S.
Steeling industry's resistance to union wage demands this year are signs that Germany's economic recovery is faltering, not least because of cost handicaps inherited from a decade of generous labor contracts and shortened working weeks.
Germany's Chamber of Industry and Commerce said Tuesday that a recent survey of 20,000 western German businesses reflected continued pessimism regarding 1994 business prospects.
The leading trade group said it expected the western German economy to post near zero expansion this year, contrasting with government forecasts of 0.5% to 1% growth.
German industry sees the recession as having bottomed out, but contends that western Germany will need a rise in export orders to generate real growth.
