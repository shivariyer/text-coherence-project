Health interests' campaign contributions in the first 13 months of the current election cycle grew nearly 23% from the same period of the 1991-92 cycle, according to an analysis by Citizen Action.
Citizen Action, a consumer group that wants a Canadian-style "single payer" health system, found that contributions from the health and insurance industries for the period Jan. 1, 1993, through Jan. 31, 1994, climbed to $11.3 million from $9.2 million in the 1991-92 period.
The analysis of Federal Election Commission records found that contributions by political action committees for doctors and health-care providers rose by 39%; hospital, health maintenance organization and nursing home PACs by 29%; pharmaceutical and equipment PACs by 21%; and insurance PACs by 7%.
Over the same span, contributions by nonhealth PACs rose 2%, according to the group.
Leading Senate recipients of health and insurance contributions during the 13-month period were Kay Bailey Hutchison (R., Texas) with $406,184; Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.) with $200,370; Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) with $179,700; Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.) with $174,150; and John Chafee (R., R.I.) with $169,375.
Leading House recipients were Jim Cooper (D., Tenn.) with $163,846; Pete Stark (D., Calif.) with $130,270; Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) with $125,901; Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) with $117,000; and Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) with $95,000.
In addition, Citizen Action said health and insurance companies have amassed a $15.8 million "war chest" -- funds in the bank -- which is available for campaign contributions.
That's an increase of 40% from Jan. 1, 1993, the group said.
