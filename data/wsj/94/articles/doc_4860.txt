Peter Canelo, market strategist at NatWest Securities, said the 30-year bond yield's move over 6.5% increases the short-term risk in stocks.
"Enough people seem to think that is a danger level that you had a good sell-off yesterday and you may see more weakness if bonds don't" stabilize, he said.
But Mr. Canelo doesn't think the Dow Jones Industrial Average is likely to fall below the 3,825 level.
He said bond yields aren't likely to climb to a level that triggers a big shift of money out of equities.
Richard Scarlata, a newsletter editor at Sutton Financial Services, agreed.
"All those solid economic readings that are bad for bonds are good for stocks.
I think we are still in a bull trend," he said.
