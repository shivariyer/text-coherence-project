Seagram Co. reported a sharp increase in fiscal fourth-quarter net income compared with year-earlier earnings, which were reduced mainly due to large one-time charges in the results of DuPont Co., in which Seagram holds a substantial stake.
For its quarter ended Jan. 31, Montreal-based Seagram reported a profit of $147 million, or 40 cents a share, up from $46 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales fell 1.1% to $1.99 billion from $2.01 billion, partly reflecting currency-translation effects.
Seagram's pretax operating profit from its distilled spirits, wines, fruit juices and other businesses was about flat at $251 million, compared with $248 million a year earlier.
Seagram holds a 24% interest in DuPont, and includes its equity interest in DuPont's earnings in its own financial statements, although it doesn't actually receive the funds.
Its fourth-quarter equity in unremitted DuPont earnings before one-time items was $6 million in its latest quarter, compared with a $25 million loss a year earlier.
In addition, nonrecurring and extraordinary items of DuPont reduced Seagram's earnings by $25 million, or seven cents a share, in the latest quarter and by $104 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier.
For the year, Seagram's pretax operating profit fell to $754 million from $762 million, due to $40 million in adverse currency translation effects, mostly in the spirits and wine operations.
Seagram said its spirits and wine group had record profits in the U.S. last year, sales and profit gains in Germany, strong growth in Asian markets, and a 10% jump in world-wide shipments of Chivas Regal Scotch Whisky.
Operating profit at Tropicana Products rose 19% to $102 million.
For the year, Seagram reported net of $379 million, or $1.02 a share, reversing a year-earlier loss of $900 million, or $2.38 a share, while sales fell slightly to $6.04 billion from $6.10 billion.
Equity in DuPont earnings increased net by $111 million, compared with $59 million a year earlier, while nonrecurring and extraordinary items at DuPont reduced earnings for the year by $271 million, and year-earlier earnings by $131 million.
And both companies had sizable accounting changes that reduced profit a year earlier.
