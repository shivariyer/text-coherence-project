Mesa Inc. said it expects natural gas production from the Hugoton field in southwest Kansas to increase by 15 billion to 20 billion cubic feet over the next three years because of changes by Kansas regulators.
For this year, Mesa said it projects production will exceed 70 billion cubic feet of equivalent natural gas, compared with 57 billion last year, with more than half of it attributable to the regulatory changes.
The Kansas Corporation Commission recently approved revisions that permit gas producers with second "infill" wells to pump 30% more gas than those who don't have such wells.
Mesa has more than 381 infill wells in the Hugoton field, more than any other producer there.
