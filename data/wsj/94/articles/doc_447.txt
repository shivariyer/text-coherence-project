The Dow Jones Industrial Average battled back from a 46-point deficit to finish with only a modest loss.
Bond prices rose, and the dollar was mixed.
The industrials fell 12.38 points to 3762.35.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.58 to 460.00.
A sell-off in technology stocks battered the Nasdaq Composite Index, which tumbled 10.95 to 772.50.
Slumping oil stocks set the stage for what looked like yet another round of broad selling in the stock market.
News that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to reach an agreement to cut production sent oil prices -- and oil stocks -- tumbling.
Crude oil for May delivery sank $1.05 a barrel, to $14.08, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
But as the bond market began to react positively to the inflation implications of lower oil prices in the afternoon, stocks trimmed their losses.
Analysts said the 46-point drop in the industrial average during the day was partly because of the bond market's initially lukewarm response to the OPEC news.
By the end of the session, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond had climbed nearly 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount.
The yield fell to 6.97% from 7.01%.
The stock market decline followed substantial turbulence last week, when the industrial average fell 120 points, or 3.1%.
"The stock market is still adjusting to the fact that interest rates are up to 7%," said Joseph McAlinden, market strategist at Dillon Read.
"We'll continue to see selling pressure."
Besides oils, economically sensitive stocks slumped.
Some analysts said investors were selling cyclicals to capture profits from that group's recent strong climb.
But Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, argued that some investors were selling cyclicals because of fear that rising interest rates will slow the economy.
He said money is flowing out of higher-priced cyclicals into less-risky downtrodden food stocks, regional banks and insurance companies.
"There's been a major change in the psychology among portfolio managers," Mr. Metz said.
"Instead of trying to maximize gains, investors are now trying to minimize risks."
Mr. McAlinden noted that amid yesterday's decline, utility stocks rose, with the Dow Jones Utility Average gaining 3.29 to 205.44.
"Utilities tend to lead the bond market, and bonds lead the stock market, so this rise may be a harbinger of a trading bounce in the next week or two," he said.
World-wide, stock prices rose in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.27 to 114.42.
Stock prices fell.
Volume totaled 287.3 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,567 issues fell and 652 rose.
Bond prices rose.
The Treasury's 10-year issue gained nearly 1/4 point, or nearly $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.60%.
The dollar was mixed.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.6715 marks and 104.05 yen compared with 1.6643 marks and 104.80 yen Friday.
