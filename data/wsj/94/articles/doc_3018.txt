State Auto Financial Corp. said it reached a reorganization agreement with 68% shareholder State Automobile Mutual Insurance Co. that is expected to add 16 cents to 20 cents a share to State Auto Financial's 1994 earnings and another 25 cents a share to its 1995 earnings.
State Auto Financial, a Columbus, Ohio, holding company, has been managed by State Automobile Mutual and paying a management fee to State Automobile Mutual.
A company spokesman said the new structure reverses this arrangement, meaning that State Auto Financial will start receiving rather than paying management fees.
The agreement must be approved by the departments of insurance in Ohio, South Carolina and South Dakota.
The company hopes to gain approval in time to make it effective April 1.
