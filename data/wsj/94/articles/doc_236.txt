Blaming sluggish apparel retail sales and additional costs related to its Chapter 11 restructuring, Leslie Fay Cos. reported a fourth-quarter loss of $48.9 million.
For the quarter, the apparel maker in New York said it lost $2.61 a share on sales of $123.3 million.
Included in the quarter was a $21.4 million charge for reorganization-related costs.
Noting that its 1992 results have been restated and are unaudited, Leslie Fay didn't provide comparable fourth-quarter results.
Leslie Fay restated its 1991 and 1992 financial results last year after an internal probe revealed that an internal accounting fraud had caused millions of dollars of false entries to be recorded into the company's books.
Leslie Fay has been operating under protection of Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code since April 1993.
Separately, Leslie Fay said that it has begun contract negotiations with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union over the proposed closing of its domestic production facilities, affecting 1,200 union employees in the Wilkes Barre, Pa., area.
The ILGWU's current three-year contract with Leslie Fay expires on May 31.
