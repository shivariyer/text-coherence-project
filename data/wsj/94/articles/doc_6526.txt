WLR Foods Inc., a chicken and turkey processor, said its board rejected an unsolicited offer by Tyson Foods Inc. to buy the company for $30 a share, or $329 million.
WLR also set up defensive measures against future hostile bids.
In a letter to Tyson, WLR Chairman Charles W. Wampler Jr. said his company's board believes it is in the "best long-term interests of WLR Foods Inc. and its shareholders for the company to remain independent."
WLR's rejection came two days after Tyson's Feb. 4 deadline for a response.
A WLR spokeswoman said Tyson hasn't announced whether it will launch a public tender offer for WLR.
Officials of Tyson Foods, the nation's biggest poultry company, couldn't be reached.
In a separate letter to shareholders, WLR announced it had set up a "Shareholder Protection Rights Plan," that could substantially dilute the holdings of any person or group that acquires 15% or more of the company's common stock.
The plan gives shareholders the right to buy additional shares at half the current market value in the event someone attempts to acquire control of the company.
The Tyson bid represented a 57% premium over the $19 closing for WLR's stock on the day of the announcement.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday, WLR shares closed at $28.25, down $1, while Tyson shares closed unchanged at $21.875.
In explaining its rejection, WLR said it has made significant capital expenditures and acquisitions in recent years to "strategically position this company to profit in a more favorable poultry cycle and national economy."
A sale, it said, would deprive shareholders from realizing the benefits of that investment, it said.
