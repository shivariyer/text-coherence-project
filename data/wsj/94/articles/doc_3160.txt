Moody's Investors Service Inc. raised the long-term debt ratings of this company formed by the merger of Society Corp., Cleveland, and KeyCorp, Albany, N.Y.
About $1.5 billion in debt was affected.
The rating agency said the upgrade reflects positive financial developments at both companies prior to the merger as well as prospective benefits that should arise from the combination.
The new company will have its headquarters in Cleveland.
Moody's said the bank's new senior rating is now single-A-1.
The former KeyCorp had a senior rating of single-A-2 and Society a senior rating of single-A-3 prior to the merger.
ORYX ENERGY Co. (Dallas) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed this oil and natural-gas company under review for potential downgrade of the Ba-2 rating on its senior unsecured long-term debt and the single-B-1 rating on its convertible subordinated debentures, affecting about $1.2 billion of long-term debt.
The ratings agency said it was concerned about the continued negative effect of low oil prices on the company's cash flow, earnings, debt-protection measurements and financial flexibility.
Moody's said it will also examine the value of Oryx Energy's oil and gas properties in an environment of low oil prices.
A spokesman for Oryx, citing its strong liquidity base, said the company was a "little bit disappointed" by Moody's action, but didn't expect the review to increase its cost of capital or impair its access to capital markets.
