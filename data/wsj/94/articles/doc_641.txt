Fanuc Ltd., Tokyo, a leading Japanese maker of numerically controlled machine tools, reached an agreement under which the company will provide machine-tool-making technology to China's Nanjing Machine Tool Works, a Fanuc spokesman said.
Terms weren't disclosed.
With Fanuc's technological support, Nanjing Machine Tool Works will start manufacturing electric-discharge machines that make dies for precision machinery parts.
The Chinese company will use parts provided by Fanuc's Beijing-based venture, Beijing-Fanuc Mechatronics Co., to make the electric-discharge machines, the company spokesman said.
