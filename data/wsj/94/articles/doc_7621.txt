Chrysler Corp. said it is recalling 115,000 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Grand Wagoneers to correct a problem with the steering column.
The recall is the third since Chrysler launched the luxurious Jeep in 1992 and highlights the quality challenges facing the auto maker, even on its newer vehicles.
Owners of the Jeeps are being notified this week to take their vehicles in for repair.
The problem stems from a flaw in pins that hold together the top and bottom halves of the Jeeps' steering columns.
Chrysler said no accidents or injuries have occurred as a result of the problem and that only 12 incidents have been reported.
A good percentage of the 115,000 Jeeps were the subject of two earlier recalls involving 117,000 Jeeps with a faulty door latch and suspension bolt.
