Oracle Corp., girding for an attack on rival Microsoft Corp., said it plans to introduce two database programs for personal computers later this year.
The leading supplier for high-end database software, Oracle had been content to allow Microsoft to dominate the market for low-cost PC databases.
Oracle said it plans to offer its own products to compete against Microsoft's Access desktop program and its database for networks.
Industry observers said Oracle should take a bite out of Microsoft's business, but not a very big chunk initially.
"It's going to be very hard for Oracle to distinguish themselves from Microsoft," said Bobby Cameron, an analyst with the Forrester Group, Boston.
Oracle said it plans to release later this year a competitor to Access, a Microsoft program that is the biggest-selling PC database.
And in September, Oracle said it will introduce a product called Oracle Workgroup Server, which is designed to support networks of 10 to 50 PCs.
The product, which Oracle said will sell for $995 for two users or $2,995 for 10 users, will run in conjunction with networking software from Microsoft, International Business Machines Co. and Novell Inc.
Oracle said that it will begin shipping today test versions of its Workgroup product to developers of applications that take advantage of it.
Mr. Cameron said that Oracle's offering will put pressure on Microsoft's comparable product, called SQL Server, and may even give Oracle a technical advantage because it sells more-powerful databases.
But this probably will come at the expense of some of Oracle's high-end revenue because of aggressive pricing on its PC products.
