Cliffs Drilling Co. said it expects to take a fourth-quarter charge of $3.5 million, or 78 cents a share.
Cliffs had previously announced a fourth-quarter charge of $577,000, or 13 cents a share, resulting from an accounting provision for 1994 termination of certain contracts.
The Houston oil services company said the $3.5 million charge results from a judgment against Cliffs in the lawsuit involving Diamond M-Odeco Offshore Inc.
In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Cliffs reported a loss of $1.1 million, or 44 cents a share, after a $1.5 million charge from the write-down of oil and gas properties.
