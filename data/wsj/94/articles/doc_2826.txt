Beverly Enterprises Inc. won a court decision scaling back a broad National Labor Relations Board order regarding more than 130 alleged labor-law violations by the nursing-home operator.
The NLRB ruled early last year that Beverly committed the violations, which date back about 10 years, in an effort to stifle union organizing.
But in an unusual step, the board concluded that the sheer number of violations indicated Beverly's proclivity toward breaking labor laws.
As a result, Beverly, Fort Smith, Ark., could have been found in contempt for subsequent violations at any of its approximately 1,000 facilities, not just the 33 facilities involved in the case.
But the federal appeals court in New York ruled that the labor board went too far in making its order company-wide.
David Snapp, nursing home director for the Service Employees International Union, which brought many of the complaints against Beverly, said the union is evaluating whether to appeal.
Two other cases involving charges of labor-law violations are pending against Beverly at the NLRB.
Just over 10% of Beverly's work force is unionized.
