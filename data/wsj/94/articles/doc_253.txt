First Financial Management Corp. awarded its chairman, president and chief executive officer, Patrick H. Thomas, restricted stock with a current indicated value of more than $26.8 million for agreeing to stay with the information-services concern through 1999.
The award of 500,000 restricted shares to Mr. Thomas also is subject to First Financial meeting a performance goal established for 1994, according to the company's annual proxy statement.
A spokesman said the board's compensation committee hasn't disclosed the specific performance goal.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, First Financial closed at $53.50, down 25 cents.
By comparison, Mr. Thomas in 1989 was awarded 236,250 restricted shares, which vested on Dec. 31, 1993.
The company's stock closed at $56.75 that day, giving that stock award a value of about $13.4 million.
The First Financial spokesman, while declining to comment directly on Mr. Thomas's compensation, said First Financial has generated "superior operating results on a consistent basis."
In 1993, the company reported that earnings rose to $127.6 million, or $2.10 a share, from $48.9 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier.
The 1992 results include a loss of approximately $64.7 million related to a write-down.
Revenue in 1993 rose to $1.67 billion from $1.43 billion.
As part of his agreement to remain with the company through 1999, Mr. Thomas also was granted an option to purchase another 500,000 shares at an exercise price of $57.25 a share.
Those options become exercisable at the rate of 100,000 shares at the end of each year, starting in 1995.
The proxy also shows that Mr. Thomas received a 1993 bonus of $5.4 million and a salary of $875,000.
That compared with a salary of $825,000 and a bonus of $3.9 million in 1992.
