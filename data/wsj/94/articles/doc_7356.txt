Marking the latest escalation in wage negotiations, Germany's powerful metals union IG Metall called for massive warning strikes in western Germany beginning today .
Negotiating on behalf of 3.7 million workers in western Germany, IG Metall is seeking wage increases of up to 6% and has come out vehemently against attempts to decrease real wages and reduce certain benefits -- steps companies say are necessary for survival.
Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of the industry's employer association, Gesamtmetall, warned that prolonged strikes could lead to the bankruptcy of 10% of the companies in the industry.
Citing uncompetitive labor costs, companies want a wage freeze, a cut in holiday benefits and a more flexible workweek.
Union President Klaus Zwickel said employers underestimate "the rage of workers and their willingness to strike."
Nevertheless, there appears to be room for compromise.
IG Metall has said it is willing to accept lower wage increases if companies agree to job guarantees or layoff prevention.
The employers' association, for its part, over the weekend stressed its interest in returning to the negotiating table.
