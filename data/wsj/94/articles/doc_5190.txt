Bankers Trust New York Corp. said a Kentucky state court approved a plan to sell about $265 million book value of real estate assets held by Kentucky Central Life Insurance Co., a failed insurer.
Kentucky insurance regulators retained Bankers Trust and Creamer Realty consultants last year to stabilize and maximize the economic value of the failed insurer's portfolio.
Bankers Trust said it would begin marketing the portfolio, which represents the bulk of the insurer's real estate assets, in the next few weeks.
Bankers Trust said it plans to break down the portfolio into pools ranging in size from $50 million to $80 million in book value.
