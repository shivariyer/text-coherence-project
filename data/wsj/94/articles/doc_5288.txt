Mayor Richard Riordan said Los Angeles won't be bidding for the 1996 Democratic and Republican national conventions because the devastation from last month's earthquake has strapped the city's finances.
"Given our fiscal priority for the recovery of all of Los Angeles and for making the city safe, we cannot guarantee millions of public dollars as Federal Election Commission rules require," the mayor said.
In the bid for the Democratic convention alone, the city would have been required to guarantee a minimum outlay of $22.5 million to convert the Los Angeles Convention Center into an arena.
That bid was to have been submitted by the end of this month.
Los Angeles, site of the 1960 presidential nomination of John F. Kennedy, had been considered the odds-on favorite for the 1996 Democratic convention.
Before the 6.8 temblor, the city had anticipated a budget shortfall of nearly $200 million for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.
Los Angeles now faces the potential loss of more than $66 million in tax revenue from businesses damaged in the quake.
"On top of the recession, the earthquake has only deepened our city's financial difficulties," Mayor Riordan said.
