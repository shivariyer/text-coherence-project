Nissan Motor Co. plans to scrap production of several varieties of vehicle chassis over the next four years in the struggling car maker's latest attempt to restore profitability.
Nissan, Japan's second-largest car company, says it makes more than 28 different kinds of chassis, the backbone upon which cars are assembled.
It wants to reduce that number by roughly a third, a move that could mean total savings of as much as 100 billion yen ($956.5 million) for Nissan, the company said.
The move caps a difficult downturn in which Nissan announced measures from factory closings to staff cuts in hopes of stemming sharp losses.
Nissan had a 108.1 billion yen pretax loss for the year ended March 31, 1993, and probably will record bigger losses in the current year.
Streamlining chassis production is "one of the restructuring programs Nissan is doing in order to enhance competitiveness," spokesman Koji Okuda said.
Like other Japanese car makers, Nissan's sales are falling -- 16% in February from year ago levels -- amid one of the worst recessions in Japan in decades.
Meanwhile, sales and revenue abroad are down because of a dramatic rise in the yen against the dollar over the past year.
Analysts say the gloomy climate is forcing Nissan to reconsider an earlier strategy to compete head on with Toyota Motor Co., Japan's largest auto maker.
