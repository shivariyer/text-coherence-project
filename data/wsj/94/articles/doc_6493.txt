Westwood One Inc., Culver City, Calif., said it completed its $101.3 million purchase of the radio-network business of Infinity Broadcasting Corp.'s Unistar Radio Networks Inc., in a transaction giving New York-based Infinity a 25% stake in Westwood One.
As expected, Infinity will manage Westwood One, with Mel Karmazin, Infinity's chief executive officer, succeeding Norman Pattiz as Westwood One's chief executive officer.
Mr. Pattiz remains Westwood One chairman.
Westwood One operates the Mutual Broadcasting System, the NBC Radio Network and other radio networks, while Infinity owns 22 stations in the nation's largest radio markets.
