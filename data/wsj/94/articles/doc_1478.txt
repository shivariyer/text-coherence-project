Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. said shareholders approved the company's proposal to change its name to Avenor Inc.
CP Forest was required to adopt a new name following last year's sale by Canadian Pacific Ltd. of its controlling stake in the forest-products company.
The new name combines the Latin root for "advantage" and the word "north."
Avenor's stock will be listed on the Toronto and Montreal exchanges as AVR.
