Richard O. Bertoli, the 61-year-old former president of a now-defunct New York securities firm, was fined $7 million and sentenced to more than eight years in federal prison for scheming to obstruct five federal proceedings.
U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said Mr. Bertoli, who was president of Executive Securities Corp., was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice, as well as obstruction of justice.
The case arose from a securities-fraud investigation of Monarch Funding Corp., another defunct New York securities firm.
U.S. Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr. has ordered Mr. Bertoli to report to authorities Monday to begin his prison term.
In New York, Mr. Bertoli's attorney, Richard Ware Levitt, said Mr. Bertoli plans to appeal and will ask an appeals court in Philadelphia to allow him to remain free on bail until the outcome of the appeal is known.
