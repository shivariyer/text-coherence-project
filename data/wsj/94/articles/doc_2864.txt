A jet plane that loses control on an icy runway is harrowing stuff, but you wouldn't know it from a recent Continental Airlines news release.
The carrier dodged disaster last week when the pilot of a Denver-bound flight aborted takeoff at New York's snowy La Guardia Airport.
The MD-80 careened off a runway and slid to a halt just short of Flushing Bay, the aircraft's nose perched over the frigid water.
Twenty-nine of the aircraft's 110 passengers were injured, with seven requiring hospitalization.
Such incidents are obvious nightmares for a corporate communications department.
Seeking to put the episode in the best possible light, the Houston-based carrier began a news release thus: "Continental Airlines Flight #795 rejected its takeoff from New York/La Guardia today at 5:59 p.m. EST resulting in a runway excursion."
Runway excursion?
The phrase particularly stood out because airlines refer to discounted advance-purchase tickets typically bought for vacations as excursion fares.
When asked about its choice of words, Continental's press office replied with a fax of Webster's entry for "excursion," whose second definition reads, "deviation from direct, definite, or proper course; esp: DIGRESSION."
Passengers on flight 795 will no doubt agree that they experienced some digression.
