Texans are still sorting out the implications of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's sudden acquittal on ethics charges Friday.
The jury returned a directed verdict of not guilty after Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle refused to proceed with the trial.
The judge had refused to assure the prosecutor that his evidence would be admissible.
Political pundits say the collapse of Mr. Earle's dubious prosecution spells trouble for him and his longtime ally, Governor Ann Richards.
Gov. Richards faces questions about her office's shredding of telephone records.
We can think of one implication of the Hutchison acquittal: Ronnie Earle should resign.
His selective prosecutions of political figures have poisoned that state's government long enough.
In fact, Texas ought to dismantle its peculiar system under which the elected district attorney for Travis County, which contains the state capitol of Austin, oversees the ethics of the entire state government.
By Texas standards, Austin is so liberal that this arrangement is roughly equivalent to allowing the voters of radical Berkeley to elect the prosecutor in charge of policing all California's officeholders.
The incentive for stacking Texas justice is just too strong.
In a sense, the flimsy Hutchison prosecution, so widely publicized, was beneath the image modern Texans are trying to project of the state.
Texas has become a first-class state in diversified businesses and a gateway to Mexico.
There are even stirrings lately of cleaning up the state's egregious tort liability system.
Sending the Earle era packing would be an important first step toward depoliticizing Texas justice.
