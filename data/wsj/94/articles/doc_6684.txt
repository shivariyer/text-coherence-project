Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on about $4.5 billion of this utility's securities.
The rating agency said it downgraded Con Ed's senior secured debt to double-A-minus from double-A; its senior unsecured debt and preferred stock to single-A-plus from double-A-minus; and its preference stock to single-A from single-A-plus.
S&P said the downgrade reflects expectations that management won't "be able to sustain a financial profile commensurate with former ratings, in view of limited sales growth prospects, declining authorized returns on equity and increasing purchased-power obligations."
A spokesman for Con Ed said the company was "disappointed" to learn about the S&P downgrade.
"We think when you look at our financial strength, the higher ratings had been warranted," he said.
