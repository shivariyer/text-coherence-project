Chipcom Corp. said it opened new sales and support offices in Beijing and Milan.
The Southborough, Mass., company said that, with the office in Beijing, it is the first U.S.-based computer networking concern to establish a presence in mainland China.
The offices will be responsible for new-business development and will also support Chipcom's existing resellers and users in the two countries, it said.
More than 42% of Chipcom's 1993 sales, or $63.6 million, were derived from international markets, a 76% increase over the year-earlier period, Chipcom said.
