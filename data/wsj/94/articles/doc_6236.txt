General Motors Corp. said it raised the dividends on its Class E and Class H common stock, reflecting improved financial results at GM's Electronic Data Systems Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiaries.
GM's subsidiaries are expected to report 1993 financial results tomorrow .
But the dividend hikes indicate that EDS and Hughes will post earnings better than the 1992 results.
For all of 1992, EDS earned $635.5 million, or $1.33 a share, and Hughes earned $921.6 million, or 11 cents a share.
The Class E and Class H shares represent dividend interest in EDS and Hughes, respectively.
GM raised its regular quarterly Class E dividend to 12 cents a common share, up 20% from the previous dividend of 10 cents a share.
The regular quarterly dividend on GM Class H shares rose 11% to 20 cents a share, up from 18 cents a share.
GM last raised the dividend on the Class E common in the 1993 first quarter.
The Class H common hadn't been raised since 1989.
The next dividends for both the classes are payable March 10 to holders of record as of Feb. 17.
