C.R. Bard Inc., which is struggling to recover from scandal over its heart-surgery instruments, said it received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market two new heart catheters in the U.S.
The Murray Hill, N.J., medical-device maker received clearance to market its "Agil" and "Silk" balloon-angioplasty catheters, both of which had been pending before the FDA for more than a year.
The upgraded catheters should help Bard sustain its estimated 6% to 7% share of the balloon-angioplasty market, Bear, Stearns & Co. analyst Frederick A. Wise said.
A pioneer of balloon angioplasty, Bard had nearly 40% of the market in 1989 before regulatory and other problems led the company to withdraw products.
Bard also said it believes it is close to resolving remaining administrative sanctions that may be imposed by the FDA.
The company last fall reached a settlement with the FDA and Justice Department, agreeing to pay $61 million in fines related to its sale of defective heart catheters.
Bard's shares rose $1.50 to $30 in late New York Stock Exchange trading on four times average volume.
