INTER-CITY PRODUCTS Corp., Toronto, said it won't pay quarterly dividends due in April on its Class C preferred shares while independent directors consider a proposal to exchange the preferred shares for common stock.
Under the proposal, preferred-share holders would be entitled to 5.5 common shares for each preferred share.
At last report, there were 2.4 million preferred shares outstanding, with a par value of 25 Canadian dollars (US$18.44) a share.
The maker of heating and cooling systems has 25 million common shares outstanding.
The company normally pays a quarterly of 50 Canadian cents on the preferred shares.
The conversion of the preferred shares is being considered to improve the company's financial position and its liquidity.
