Its property values battered by the California recession, Catellus Development Corp. reported a wider fourth-quarter loss of $13.2 million.
The loss of 27 cents a share compares with a loss of $3.4 million, or seven cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue grew 40% to $85.1 million.
The San Francisco real-estate concern's loss included a $33 million writedown for property, reflecting the lack of demand for commercial development.
The company also reported that its real-estate assets declined to $1.7 billion from $2.1 billion a year ago, mostly because of falling property values in California.
Last month Vernon B. Schwartz, chairman, chief executive and president, announced that he would step down in June after his turnaround strategy came under fire by directors representing Calpers, California's state employee pension plan, which owns a 40% stake in the company.
