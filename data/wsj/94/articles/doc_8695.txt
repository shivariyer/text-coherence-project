Host Marriott Corp., Bethesda, Md., said it signed a nonbinding letter of intent to sell 26 Fairfield Inns to a venture comprising Sage Hospitality Resources Inc. and Carlyle Group L.P., for proceeds of about $115 million, of which $27 million will be in the form of a note.
Host Marriott said the sale is expected to close in June and is subject to certain conditions and approvals.
Marriott International Inc. will continue to operate more than 50 Fairfield Inns and will remain the Fairfield Inn franchiser.
Last October, Marriott Corp. split itself into Marriott International, a management company, and Host Marriott, a real-estate and travel-concessions concern.
Closely held Sage Hospitality is based in Denver.
