Fidelity Medical Inc., Florham Park, N.J., said it reached a consent agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a SEC probe of Fidelity Medical's revenue-recognition practices.
The investigation relates to the company's 1991 public offering and alleged violations of various provisions of the federal securities law.
After the company said it found "irregularities in its revenue-recognition practices," Efraim Landa, the company's former chief executive officer, resigned in 1992 and three years of financial reports were restated.
The maker of electronic systems for medical imaging and cardiodiagnosis said it would consent to the entry of a permanent injunction against violations of certain provisions of federal securities laws.
A company spokesman said the company, which didn't admit to or deny the allegations, is not required to pay a fine.
Last month, Fidelity Medical entered an agreement to settle a pending related securities class-action suit.
Fidelity Medical had revenue of $5.7 million for the year ended Sept. 30.
