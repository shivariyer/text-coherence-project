American Exploration Co. said it completed a natural gas well that will increase its daily gas production by about 10% to 35 million cubic feet a day from 32 million cubic feet a day.
The oil and natural-gas company said its Oosicela-Mitchell 1 well in the Permian Basin of West Texas tested at a rate of 12.1 million cubic feet of gas a day at depths between 13,220 feet and 14,250 feet.
American Exploration said it expects to place the well on production May 1.
American Exploration, the operator, holds a 35% working interest in the well, with closely held companies and private individuals holding the remaining 65%.
