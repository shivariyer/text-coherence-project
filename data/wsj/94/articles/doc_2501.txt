Battle Mountain Gold Co. said it will produce about 495,000 ounces of gold in 1994, increasing output by about 24% from 1993 production of about 400,000 ounces.
The Houston mining company, which holds interests in properties in Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Bolivia, said its gold reserves rose to 7.4 million ounces at the start of 1994 from about 7.2 million ounces at the first of 1993.
In a related matter, the company said it has received permits for its new Reona gold heap leach project, which is part of the mining concern's Battle Mountain complex in Nevada.
The company has begun construction of the project, which should produce about 50,000 ounces a year when complete.
About 26,000 ounces will be produced at Reona this year, beginning in the third quarter, Battle Mountain said.
