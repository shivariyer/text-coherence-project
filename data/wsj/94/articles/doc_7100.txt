Nursing-home operator Multicare Cos., Hackensack, N.J., said it agreed to acquire Providence Health Care Inc., a Berea, Ohio, provider of long-term nursing care, for $27.8 million.
Multicare said it will pay $7.50 a share for Providence's 3.7 million shares outstanding.
With other costs such as severance and transaction expenses are added, Multicare said the total transaction cost will be closer to $30 million.
News of the deal helped propel Providence's shares up $1.625, or 28%, to $7.375 on heavy volume in the Nasdaq SmallCap market.
Multicare edged up 12.5 cents to $18.875 in late Nasdaq trading.
The pact comes nearly six weeks after Providence agreed to put itself up for sale as part of an agreement with a dissident investor group, Commonwealth Associates of New York.
Multicare president and co-chief executive Daniel Straus said the acquisition will strengthen Midwestern operations and expand facilities to 52 from 36.
