Texas Instruments Inc. said it developed a computer chip set designed for notebook and "subnotebook" computers.
The device, dubbed Rio Grande, cuts in half the number of chips needed to run most computer functions.
Fewer chips, in turn, can reduce the size and weight of portable PCs.
The chip set is part of a broad TI push, announced in October, to take on chip makers Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for control of the market for the electronic brains that run portable computers.
The chip set includes a 486SX-class microprocessor and a second chip that controls accessory slots used for fax and modem capabilities and additional memory.
A third chip controls all other standard PC functions.
The Dallas company said it expects to start shipping the device this fall.
