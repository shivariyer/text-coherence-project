General Motors Corp. said that a new study of fatal accidents involving its controversial pickups shows they were being driven faster before accidents than were comparable Ford pickups.
GM's contention that speed contributed to accidents involving its 1973-1987 pickups, was included in 27 boxes of documents it submitted to federal safety regulators.
GM made the submission as part of its continuing effort to defend the trucks, which have side-mounted gasoline tanks.
Federal safety regulators asked GM to recall its trucks because they were involved in more fiery fatal side impacts than were its competitors, which have tanks mounted inside the trucks' frame rails.
GM has sought to show that driver behavior, not its fuel-system design, could account for the difference.
GM said that its analysis of fatal accident reports involving the Ford and GM pickups shows that, on average, Ford trucks were being driven at 40 miles per hour and GM trucks were being driven at 43 miles per hour before they were involved in side accidents.
GM also argued that when all accidents are analyzed, its trucks are substantially safer than most other vehicles.
Federal regulators said GM's submission, which was made in February, and released to the public this week, consists mostly of updates of accidents already discussed by GM in previous submissions.
