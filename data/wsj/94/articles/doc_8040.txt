Dauphin Deposit Corp. said its board has authorized the repurchase of as many as one million common shares.
Currently, Dauphin has about 32.5 million shares outstanding.
In a news release, the commercial-banking concern said it expects to use available cash for the repurchases, which will be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
The company said the repurchased shares would be used for general corporate purposes, including the employee stock-purchase plan and stock-option plan.
