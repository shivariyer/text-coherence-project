Sherman N. Mullin will retire as president of Lockheed Advanced Development Co., known as the "Skunk Works," at the end of February.
He will be succeeded by Jack S. Gordon, 53, who has been executive vice president of the unit since 1990.
Mr. Mullin, 58 years old, joined what was then called Lockheed Electronics Co. in 1959 as an electronics engineer.
He held a number of different posts at Lockheed before being named president of the Skunk Works in December 1990.
Founded in 1943, the unit is the designer of some of the nation's most secret and elaborate aircraft, including the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes and the F-117A radar-evading, or "stealth," fighter.
