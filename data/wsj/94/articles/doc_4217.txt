Sun Co., Philadelphia, said it signed a letter of intent to acquire a large Chevron Corp. oil refinery and a one-third interest in a pipeline connecting the plant to New York for $170 million.
Sun said the 177,000-barrel-a-day refinery is located next to its own Philadelphia plant, and the company will improve efficiencies by operating them as one unit.
In San Francisco, a Chevron spokesman didn't dispute the $170 million purchase price cited by Sun but said, "We think it's premature to discuss a purchase price at this time."
As part of a restructuring of its refining business, Chevron last May said that it would try to sell the plant, as well as a Port Arthur, Texas, refinery.
The company spokesman said Chevron expects to make an announcement about a possible buyer for the Port Arthur plant in a few weeks.
