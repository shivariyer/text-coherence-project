A group of shareholders of Banco Espanol de Credito, the big Spanish bank that was seized by regulators in December, will request approval to take legal action against the bank's former chairman and board of directors at the bank's shareholders meeting Saturday.
Jaime Guerra, the lawyer for the shareholders group, said it's still unclear whether holders will be asked Saturday to bring a criminal suit or a civil liability suit against the former board of Banesto for allegedly providing misleading information about the bank's 95-billion-peseta ($685.6 million) capital-raising exercise last year.
In a criminal suit, board members and former Banesto Chairman Mario Conde would face possible jail sentences if found guilty of wrongdoing.
In a civil suit, they would be required to respond to financial claims with their personal assets.
Mr. Conde is unlikely to appear at the meeting, nor would he respond to the threat of a legal suit until it becomes a reality, a person close to him said.
Mr. Conde wasn't available to comment.
