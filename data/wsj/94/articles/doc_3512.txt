Motorola Inc. scored its first point in a campaign to get some respect in the supercomputing industry, persuading a German fast-computer maker, Parsytec Computer GmbH, to use its new PowerPC chip.
Though one of the world's biggest chip makers for ordinary computers, Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola has been struggling recently to sell its chips as the number-crunching engines inside so-called massively parallel processors.
These are super-fast machines that get their speed by yoking together scores of microprocessor chips inside the same box.
So far, though, such Motorola rivals as Digital Equipment Corp. and Intel Corp. have been leading chip suppliers in this highly specialized field.
But yesterday, Motorola announced its first convert in the parallel-processor industry.
Parsytec, based in Aachen, Germany, said it's using PowerPC -- a new line of chips jointly developed by Motorola, International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. -- inside its new product range.
Though small, Parsytec has a good reputation for supplying specialized high-speed computing gear.
