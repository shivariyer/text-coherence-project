Merchants Group Inc. said it expects that weather-related losses for January and February will be about $1.8 million greater than normal, or about 38 cents a share more after taxes.
The weather caused increased insurance claims for roof damage and water damage relating to frozen and burst pipes.
Results for the first quarter, to be reported in May, will depend on the level of weather-related losses incurred in March, as well as claims for nonweather related losses for the entire quarter, the Buffalo, N.Y., property and casualty insurer said.
For the 1993 first quarter, Merchants had net income of $1.5 million, or 71 cents a share, including an accounting gain of $306,000.
