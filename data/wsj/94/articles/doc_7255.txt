Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich., said its fourth-quarter earnings rose 6% to $163.8 million, or 92 cents a share, from $154.2 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier.
The results, which exceeded analysts expectations, marked the last quarter under the team led by Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chairman and chief executive officer, who died in April from cancer.
Last month, Upjohn named John L. Zabriskie, an executive vice president at Merck & Co., as chairman and CEO.
He officially assumed responsibility this month.
Sales for the period slid 4.2% to $926.3 million from $967.1 million a year earlier.
Sales of several Upjohn products were down from the year earlier period.
Worldwide sales of Xanax, an anti-anxiety agent, plunged 39% during the quarter to $120 million.
Patent protection on Upjohn's top-selling drug expired last October.
Sales of Rogaine, a treatment for hair loss, slipped 33% to $28 million and sales of Halcion, a sleep medication, were off 1%.
Halcion, which is banned in the United Kingdom, lost its patent protection in October, too.
UPJOHN Co. said world-wide sales of its Halcion sleeping pill rose 1% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.
An article yesterday incorrectly stated that Halcion sales were off 1% for the period.
