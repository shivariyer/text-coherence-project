In a merger of two fast-growing software companies, Compuware Corp. announced an agreement to buy Uniface Holding BV for stock valued at more than $245 million.
Compuware, Farmington Hills, Mich., said it will issue 6.7 million of its common shares to Uniface stockholders.
In addition, holders of Uniface options will receive about 1.3 million Compuware options, though their value was not specified.
Compuware closed at $36.625, up 87.5 cents, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Uniface, based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, sells programming tools to help customers develop software to run their businesses using networks of PCs and workstations.
It has major operations in Alameda, Calif.
Compuware makes similar programs for use with mainframe computers, and also provides data processing services.
It said the move will help give it products to work on a wider array of machines and solve more customer problems.
