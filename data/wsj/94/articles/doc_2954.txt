A federal jury in Newark, N.J., awarded Cooper Distributing Co. $9.4 million, including $3 million in punitive damages, in a contract dispute with Amana Refrigeration Inc., a unit of Raytheon Co.
An Amana spokeswoman said the company planned to appeal the verdict, which was announced Friday.
Cooper had charged the appliance manufacturer with wrongful termination of its 30-year-old distribution agreement to represent the Amana line in the New York area.
The distributor sued after Amana sent it a 10-day termination notice on Nov. 5, 1991, which was part of a nationwide appliance consolidation effort.
In the ensuing legal battle, the Newark-based distributor argued that Cooper Distributing qualified under the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act which protects New Jersey businesses from cancellation for any reason other than poor performance.
Amana had challenged that Cooper did not meet the legal definition of a franchise.
In January 1992, a judge issued a preliminary injunction giving Cooper the right to continue as Amana's distributor pending resolution of the issue at trial.
