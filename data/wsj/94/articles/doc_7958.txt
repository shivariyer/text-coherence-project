A year after two West Coast children died from eating tainted hamburger, Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy is expected today to announce steps to reduce chances of similar outbreaks.
His recommendations are likely to include a much tougher meat-inspection system that relies more on scientific testing and less on visual examination.
While Mr. Espy's office wouldn't comment on specific proposals, aides billed the announcement, at a food-safety seminar in New York tonight, as "significant," adding, "if there's one thing he's adamant about, it's to change the inspection system at all levels."
The secretary took office amid widespread concern about the safety of meat after the fatalities linked to undercooked hamburger served at Jack in the Box fast-food restaurants.
The deaths were caused by the bacteria E.coli 0157:H7, which since has been blamed for hundreds of illnesses nationwide.
Mr. Espy recently was briefed by USDA scientists on a rapid-detection test for E.coli and other food-borne pathogens, as well as antibacterial sprays that could be used on carcasses in meat-processing plants, aides say.
