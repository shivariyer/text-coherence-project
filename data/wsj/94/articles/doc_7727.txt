Premier Anesthesia Inc., as part of a companywide restructuring, doubled a previously announced pretax charge to fourth-quarter earnings to $24 million.
In addition, the company said its president, Richard D. Ballard, and its executive vice president, Terry S. Vitez, resigned their positions effective last Sunday.
Both men also resigned as directors and will remain with the company as consultants.
Premier Anesthesia's chairman and chief executive officer, Richard L. Jackson, will succeed Mr. Ballard as president.
The increase in the quarterly earnings charge stems from the company's decision to undertake a more radical restructuring than previously envisioned, Mr. Jackson said in an interview.
Premier Anesthesia's pain-relief subsidiary, now called the Pain Relief Network Inc., has been reduced to about 30 employees from 225, he said.
Moreover, the company plans to shift the marketing of its core anesthesia services away from hospitals and toward smaller practice groups.
The restructuring charge will produce a loss for both the fourth quarter and the year, Mr. Jackson said.
In the 1992 fourth quarter, Premier earned $976,486, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $16.3 million.
For all of 1992, the company had net income of $2.6 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $58.6 million.
The reduction of the company's pain-relief business is largely a result of billing delays in workers compensation cases in California, said Mr. Jackson.
