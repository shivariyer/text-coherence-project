Home Depot Inc., in a move that accelerates its planned expansion north of the border, agreed to acquire 75% of a Canadian home-improvement chain from Molson Cos. for approximately $150 million.
Through its partnership with Molson and its Aikenhead's Home Improvement Warehouse, Home Depot will be operating five stores in Canada immediately and as many as 10 to 14 stores there by year end.
Home Depot operates 269 home-improvement stores in the U.S.
In all, Home Depot expects to have at least 50 stores in Canada within five years, said Arthur Blank, Home Depot's president and chief operating officer.
Aikenhead's, which opened its first store almost two years ago, now has five outlets in the Toronto area.
Home Depot expects its partnership with Molson to dilute per-share earnings for the year ending next January by one or two cents, said Bernard Marcus, Home Depot's chairman and chief executive.
But he added that he expects the union to be "very profitable" the following year.
Home Depot will own 75% and Molson 25% of the combined business, to be called Home Depot Canada.
