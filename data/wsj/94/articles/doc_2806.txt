Pioneer Electronic Corp. plans to open karaoke rooms in several U.S. and European locales by mid-1994, a spokesman for the Japanese concern said.
In karaoke, would-be stars sing and perform their favorite songs against audiovisual backdrops.
Karaoke rooms, rental gathering spaces for families and other groups, are a craze in Japan.
The Pioneer spokesman said the company will own and operate the karaoke room locations.
He said Pioneer has concrete plans to open karaoke rooms in Pasadena, Calif., in May; Barcelona in June; and Milan in August.
He said the company already has Star Factory karaoke rooms in Chicago, Honolulu and Los Angeles.
Last May, Pioneer announced plans to franchise the karaoke business and bring the number of outlets to 500 by 1999.
