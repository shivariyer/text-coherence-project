Standard & Poor's Corp. placed its ratings of this utility on CreditWatch with negative implications.
The move is pending a meeting with the company's management to discuss plans to reduce costs following the issuance of a final rate order by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.
About $960 million of securities is affected.
The order, to be issued in a few weeks, may require rate reductions of $6.7 million for the utility and $10 million to $15 million for its gas pipeline subsidiary Enogex.
An Oklahoma Gas spokesman said company officials knew the rate decision would be damaging, but that until the commission's order is final "it's impossible to make any decision regarding cost cutting" at the utility.
