Moody's Investors Service Inc. put the debt ratings of Crane under review for possible downgrade, affecting about $100 million of debt.
Moody's said it initiated the review because of Crane's "more aggressive acquisition profile."
Crane's senior unsecured debt is now rated Baa-1 and subordinated debt is rated Baa-2.
Crane makes products for commercial and industrial markets.
SPRINT Corp. (Westwood, Kan.) -- Standard & Poor's Corp. raised the senior unsecured debt ratings of this telecommunications company and its Centel Capital Corp. unit, affecting about $1.2 billion of debt.
S&P raised ratings to triple-B from triple-B-minus, noting the strengthening financial performance of Sprint's long-distance telephone operations.
It said local telephone units continue to provide strong earnings and cash-flow support for debt, while cellular operations are moving rapidly toward "sustainable operating profitability."
Consolidated debt leverage is expected to decline to between 50% and 55% over the next two years from about 60% at the end of 1993, S&P said.
