Italy's Societa Italiana per l'Esercizio delle Telecomunicazioni SpA said Avis Inc. awarded it a two-year contract to manage the car-rental company's data-telecommunications needs in Italy.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The agreement calls for SIP to give Avis technical assistance and help in the development of a telecommunications network.
SIP is 60%-owned by Societa Finanziaria Telefonica per Azioni, or STET, Italy's telecommunications holding company.
STET, which is scheduled to be privatized later this year, is 53%-owned by state industrial holding group Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale.
