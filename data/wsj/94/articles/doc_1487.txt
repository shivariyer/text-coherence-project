British Aerospace PLC said it is looking for a partner to invest in its $2 billion project to design a new aircraft, the RJX Avroliner.
John Schofield, regional vice president of the company's Avro division, said negotiations were held with Taiwan Aerospace Corp. but that no agreement was reached.
Mr. Schofield said development costs of the Avroliner were too high for British Aerospace to bear alone and that the company was seeking a partner with strong manufacturing capabilities and technical expertise.
The executive spoke to a news conference during a flight demonstration at Bahrain International Airport of the Avro RJ70, which came into service in 1993 for short-haul purposes.
Avro officials are touring the oil-rich region in search of potential customers for the $25 million plane, which can land on unpaved runways.
