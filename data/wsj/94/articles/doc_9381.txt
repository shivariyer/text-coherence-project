Morgan Stanley Group Inc. said it plans an offering of warrants tied to the value of the mark relative to the U.S. dollar.
The offering includes five million mark put warrants and 2.5 million call warrants.
The value of the put warrants will be based on decreases in the value of the mark relative to the U.S. dollar, and the value of the call warrants will be based on increases in the value of the mark relative to the dollar, the investment banking company said.
Morgan Stanley has applied to list the warrants on the American Stock Exchange, which already lists several similar issues.
