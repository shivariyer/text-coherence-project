Chrysler Corp. increased wholesale prices on the Dodge Intrepid and other big sedans by $210, or about 1.2% -- but the the retail prices aren't changing.
The Highland Park, Mich., auto maker raised wholesale prices $200 and raised its destination charge $10.
The increases don't change the manufacturers suggested retail price on the sedans -- $19,747 for an Eagle Vision ESI.
But dealers will now add on to that a $535 destination charge, up from $525.
Moreover, dealers will be less likely to offer steep discounts because the wholesale price they pay on the base Vision is up $200 to $17,499.95.
The price change seems designed to increase prices without garnering negative publicity that would be produced by a retail price increase, but Chrysler said the increase was intended to keep its dealer margins in line with the industry.
A Chrysler LHS, including destination charges, will cost $30,878 under the new prices, an increase of $10.
The wholesale price for the vehicle will be $26,690.55, up $200.
The destination charges for the New Yorker and LHS sedans were increased $10 to $595.
