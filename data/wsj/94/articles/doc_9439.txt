The board of QualMed Inc. has recommended that shareholders approve the company's delayed $775 million merger with the operator of a California health maintenance organization.
The Pueblo, Colo., company postponed a Jan. 7 special meeting of shareholders that was to have voted on the merger with closely hold HN Management Holding Inc. so it could study the impact of an $89 million court award against that company's Health Net unit.
The award was granted by a California jury to the family of a breast-cancer patient who died after Health Net refused to pay for an experimental bone-marrow transplant.
Malik M. Hasan, QualMed's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said that "we believe Health Net acted appropriately and in a principled fashion."
After reviewing reports, a committee of QualMed directors recommended that QualMed complete the merger.
The board voted unanimously to accept the recommendation and rescheduled the special meeting for Jan. 25.
