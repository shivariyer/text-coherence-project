Claudia E. Mott, director of small-cap research at Prudential Securities Inc., said she is a little concerned about the lofty levels of financial-related stocks.

"But a fair number of financial earnings have been disappointing.
If investors are going to continue to play the momentum side, financials will fall out of favor."
She said the group may continue to perform well because rates are still relatively low.
William Sulya, head of over-the-counter trading at A.G. Edwards & Sons, said trading volume tends to be relatively thin on smaller transport stocks, which can push their stock prices around easily on limited buying or selling.
