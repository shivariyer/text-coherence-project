Lyondell Petrochemical Co., Houston, said it set its 1994 capital spending at $90 million, compared with 1993 capital expenditures of $69 million.
The petrochemical company alloted $30 million to petrochemical operations, compared with $15 million in 1993.
The remaining $60 million will go to Lyondell's affiliate, Lyondell-Citgo Refining Co., which received $45 million in 1993.
The 1994 budget includes building costs for a butylene isomerization unit at the company's Channelview, Texas, plant, a project Lyondell said it expects to complete by the fourth quarter.
Not included in the 1994 budget is the $150 million Lyondell-Citgo Refining Co. said it will spend this year on an $800 million upgrade of its Houston refinery, a joint venture with Citgo Petroleum Corp., a U.S. subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
