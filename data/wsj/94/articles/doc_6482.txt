Your Jan. 7 Marketplace article concerning Valujet Airlines in Georgia stated that the Fitzgerald Airport facilities consisted of "a short, turf runway more suitable to tiny propjets and cropdusters."
While Fitzgerald Municipal is certainly no Hartfield or LaGuardia, it is one of the most up-to-date general aviation airports in the state, with an FAA-approved one-mile paved and lighted runway used by corporate jets of many of our 40 industries and three hundred businesses.
While we are not seeking Valujet's service, it certainly would not be an outrageous suggestion, as you seem to suggest.
