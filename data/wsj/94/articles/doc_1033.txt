Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong, agreed in principle to buy a 75% stake in freight carrier Air Hong Kong in a deal that would allow Cathay to absorb a rival and strengthen its already dominant position in the local aviation market.
The planned purchase also prevents Guangzhou-based China Southern Airlines from buying into Air Hong Kong.
The price wasn't disclosed, but industry executives estimated it at $20 million.
Cathay agreed to acquire the stake from Shun Tak Holdings Ltd., controlled by Stanley Ho, which currently owns 80% of the carrier.
Shun Tak and Mr. Ho, best known for his casino interests in Macao, would retain 25% of the carrier.
Mr. Ho is to remain chairman of Air Hong Kong, but management control is to pass to Cathay.
In a statement, Cathay Chairman Peter Sutch said Air Hong Kong's cargo services to Europe and Asia are likely to merge with those of Cathay.
