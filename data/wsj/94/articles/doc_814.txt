The European Court of Justice rejected a case brought by French state airline Air France against the European Union for not probing under its merger rules British Airways PLC's 1992 takeover of unprofitable U.K. carrier Dan Air Services Ltd.
The court upheld a ruling by the EU Commission that the Dan Air businesses British Airways acquired didn't have revenue exceeding the 250 million European Currency Units threshold for an investigation fixed in EU merger rules.
The court has yet to rule in a separate Air France case brought against the EU for approving British Airways' November 1992 takeover of French regional airline Transport Aerien Transregional.
