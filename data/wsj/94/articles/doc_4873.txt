A federal judge has dismissed a patent-infringement lawsuit brought against Nintendo Co. by a unit of National Semiconductor Corp.
Separately, Nintendo's U.S. unit, based here, said 60 companies that make software for its video-game systems joined it in asking the U.S. trade representative to take action against China, Taiwan, Panama, Venezuela, Argentina and Paraguay for failing to stop the counterfeiting of video-game cartridges.
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle against Japan-based Nintendo in 1992 by Fairchild Semiconductor, which was acquired by National Semi in 1987.
The suit alleged that Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System infringes a 1978 Fairchild patent that covers how a cartridge locks into a video-game system.
U.S. District Judge John Coughenour concluded that no reasonable jury could find that the two companies' technologies were similar enough to support a claim of patent infringement.
National Semi, based in Santa Clara, Calif., had no immediate comment.
In the trade action, Nintendo charged that the six countries haven't adequately protected U.S. copyrights and trademarks against counterfeiters.
Nintendo asserted that counterfeiting of video games in China has reached "crisis proportions," with millions of counterfeit products produced by governmentcontrolled or state-owned enterprises.
It urged that China be designated a "priority foreign country" under the Special 301 provision of U.S. trade law.
Nintendo also asked that Taiwan be kept on a "priority watch list" for not stopping counterfeit game exports.
It said Panama, Venezuela, Argentina and Paraguay should be placed on a "watch list" for failing to protect trademarks and to stop counterfeiting.
