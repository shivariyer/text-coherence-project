Alexander & Alexander Inc., New York, was found liable for breach of contract, resulting in a $9.9 million judgment in a lawsuit brought against it by Preferred Employers Group Inc.
In its civil suit in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, Preferred alleged that Alexander & Alexander usurped its plan to sell a workers compensation program aimed at fast-food restaurant chains.
Preferred, a Miami-based insurance company, said it had entered an agreement with Alexander to implement its program for Burger King and other franchises.
Alexander "obtained property and casualty insurance packages but instead of giving it to Preferred, it gave it to one of its own subsidiaries," Preferred's attorneys said.
"Futhermore, it began a scheme to pirate the Preferred program and market it."
A spokeswoman for Alexander & Alexander, the U.S. unit of insurance brokerage firm Alexander & Alexander Services Inc., said the unit was "disappointed" with the jury's decision and planned to appeal.
A spokeswoman added that the decision would have no material impact on the finances of the firm.
