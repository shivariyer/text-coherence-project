Baxter International Inc. said it launched a world-wide withdrawal of its Gammagard intravenous immune-globulin product after learning that a small number of patients who used it apparently contracted hepatitis C.
Gammagard is a concentrate of human proteins known as immunoglobulins, which are derived from donated blood plasma.
It's used in treating a number of inherited immunological deficiencies and in applications such as bone-marrow transplants.
While there is no approved test that can directly detect the hepatitis C virus, Baxter said, the donated plasma is screened for antibodies to hepatitis C and other viruses.
"Until now," the company said, "there have been no reports of viral transmission, including hepatitis C, associated with the product since its approval."
Gammagard has been sold in Europe since 1983, and since 1986 in this country.
Hepatitis C, which is typically acquired through blood transfusions or through intimate contact, can lead to chronic hepatitis or to serious liver disease such as cirrhosis.
A spokesman for Baxter's Hyland division, which manufactures the product, said the number of people receiving the product is in the "thousands."
The company said it learned from recent doctors' reports that 14 patients who used the products may have contracted hepatitis C, although it stressed that in some cases other "risk factors" were at work.
Hyland, based in Glendale, Calif., said that it has applications pending with the Food and Drug Administration and certain other countries' regulators on a modified immune-globulin product, in which the concentrate is treated with an organic solvent and a detergent aimed at inactivating "lipid-enveloped" viruses such as hepatitis C.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Baxter closed at $22.625, down 62.5 cents.
