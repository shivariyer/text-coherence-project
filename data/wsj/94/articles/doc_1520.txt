Glycomed Inc. has received questions from the Food and Drug Administration regarding the chemical makeup and toxicology of Astenose, a leading Glycomed compound, President Brian Atwood said.
Glycomed filed an investigational new drug application with the FDA in February, in effect asking permission to begin human clinical trials of Astenose, a drug to prevent restenosis, or constriction, of arteries following angioplasty.
If the FDA doesn't have questions, a clinical trial may go forward 30 days after the application was filed.
But Mr. Atwood said in an interview that the agency formally notified the biotechnology company on Thursday that it needed more information about the compound before human tests can begin.
"They raised issues we have to address: issues of chemistry, or how we define the molecule, and issues of toxicity, its anticoagulant profile," Mr. Atwood said.
Astenose, a novel carbohydrate-based drug, is a modified version of the classic anticoagulant drug heparin, which is used to thin the blood during heart attacks or surgery.
However, heparin tends to cause bleeding complications and its effects are hard to reverse.
Glycomed has designed Astenose to lessen its harsher anticoagulant effects by up to 95%, Mr. Atwood said.
However, he added, "if you use it at high enough doses, it looks and acts like heparin," in terms of possible bleeding.
Mr. Atwood said Glycomed still hopes to enter Astenose into clinical trials this spring, once it has analyzed and answered FDA's questions.
In Rockville, Md., an FDA spokesman declined to comment specifically on Glycomed's drug application.
However, he said, "It's not unusual for us to have communication back and forth with companies during all phases of drug development, including IND submission, clinical trials, and regulatory review."
