A joint venture of Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co. that makes Mylanta brand antacid filed suit against a small closely held firm in New Jersey, charging it with patent infringement.
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court here by Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co., Fort Washington, Pa., alleges that Guardian Drug Co. sells an antacid product under the name Myacid that is "confusingly similar" to the J&J-Merck joint venture's Mylanta product.
The joint venture also asked the court to stop Guardian from making and distributing its product under the name Myacid, or any other name that is "confusingly similar" to Mylanta.
The joint venture, formed by Johnson & Johnson and Merck in 1990 to market over the counter drugs, brought other actions against other makers of antacids and other products and succeeded in getting them to stop making those products under similar names or packages, a J&J spokesman said.
In 1993, sales of Mylanta totaled about $142 million, and accounted for roughly 18% of all U.S. sales of antacid products, the suit says.
Abbas Dahodwala, vice president of marketing and finance at Guardian, said that company has annual sales of about $10 million, with sales from Myacid totaling about $500,000 a year.
He said the company, which has been selling the Myacid product for about seven years, will consult with its attorneys and decide what course to take.
