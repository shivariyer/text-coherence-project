International Business Machines Corp. is expanding its push into the peripherals market.
The company announced a line of hard drives, fax boards, keyboards and other accessories and replacement parts, called Options by IBM, designed for all IBM-compatible PCs.
The U.S. market for such PC peripherals totals about $10 billion a year, and is growing about 20%, estimates Steve Starkey of the IBM PC Co. unit, the product manager for the new line.
IBM entered the peripherals market for non-IBM PCs last June, when it began selling its Easy Options line of computer joysticks, mice and other items in retail stores.
Easy Options is aimed at consumers, while the new line targets the much larger commercial, education and government markets.
It will be sold through resellers, such as ComputerLand, as well as through IBM PC's toll-free order number.
Many of the Easy Options products are made for IBM by other companies.
In contrast, the new line will capitalize on IBM's strengths in such areas as hard-drive design and computer-chip manufacturing, Mr. Starkey says.
For the first time, for example, IBM's Storage Systems Division will make its products widely available.
Previously, most of its hard drives, tape drives and other data-storage products were used by IBM in its own products.
The move is part of IBM's drive to boost its sales and profits by selling through all distribution channels.
But IBM faces some tough, established competitors, such as hard-drive maker Seagate Technology and modem-maker Intel Corp.
In addition, IBM must overcome any lingering perceptions that its peripherals won't work with non-IBM PCs, says Richard Zwetchkenbaum, an analyst at International Data Corp.
IBM also needs to ensure that its products are at least as profitable to resellers as are competitor's.
But if it overcomes these hurdles, "it's a big business opportunity," Mr. Zwetchkenbaum says, because peripherals carry higher profit margins than PCs.
