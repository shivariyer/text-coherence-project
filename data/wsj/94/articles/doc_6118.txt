In response to "Quandary Over One Term to Cover Myriad People," People Patterns, Jan. 18: The last time I looked, the Census Bureau reckoned me an "Hispanic-surnamed individual."
Not a bad concept.
Sure, it had flaws: What if the father is an O'Hara and the mother a Hernandez?
How about a German-surnamed, German-speaking, blue-eyed, freckled redhead who emigrated from Chile?
But "Hispanic-surnamed individual" had a charming, bureaucratic awkwardness.
And in my case at least, it was conspicuously appropriate.
The newer terms don't seem less flawed: Our German-surnamed Chilean-American Latino with red hair, blue eyes and freckles is still not a clean fit.
Nor is the Hispanic-surnamed Mexican-American individual who grew up speaking only English in Pittsburgh and now lives in Mississippi.
Maybe we should stick with the surname concept until a new Linnaeus happens upon a more user-friendly ethnic phylum.
Lamentably, the surname concept can also be used as a marketing tool: I've gotten calls from a company pushing its long-distance telephone services and featuring Spanish-speaking salespeople.
Why me?
Am I overly touchy or do all the Weslowskys out there have to put up with the same thing?
Or is it my name?
In these times, I suppose that ensuring a polite ethnic nomenclature must be a serious issue to somebody and that somewhere teeth are grinding over the tough choices.
But as for me, "Call me anything you like.
Just don't call me late for `almuerzo.'"
Long Beach, Miss.
