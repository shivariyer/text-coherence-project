In a bid to get needed technology for its space program, Brazil agreed to be bound by international controls on certain sensitive, missile-related exports.
A Foreign Ministry communique, addressed to the 25 members of the Missile Technology Control Regime, said Brazil was ready to follow the group's rules.
The group, which includes the U.S. and other major industrial powers, was created in 1987 to curb the risk of proliferation of missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.
Antonio Guerreiro, chief of the ministry's Sensitive Technologies Department, said Brazil now expects to get help for its space program.
Brazil's space industry produces satellites, but lacks a triggering device to put them in orbit.
The U.S., France, Russia and China have denied Brazil the technology largely because of Brazil's reluctance to abide by export control rules.
Mr. Guerreiro said Brazil could produce medium-range or short-range missiles, but is "not interested in this type of arms."
"Our space program is designed to serve peaceful purposes and its goal is to build its own satellite launcher," he said.
