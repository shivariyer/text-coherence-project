The March 16 Letter from Ronald L. Ziegler of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores unsuccessfully tried to disprove the article "Killing Drug Research Kills People," with the statement: "There is insufficient return on investment for a manufacturer to become a producer of only interchangeable commodities."
It is precisely the profitability of producing interchangeable commodities that has produced the success of the generic drug manufacturing industry and the increase in use of store labels by his organization's members.
