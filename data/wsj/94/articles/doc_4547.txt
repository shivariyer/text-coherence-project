Summit Bancorp. said it agreed to purchase Crestmont Financial in a transaction valued at $91 million, or $23.50 a share.
Summit, a $4.3-billion-asset banking company in Chatham, N.J., is purchasing $1-billion-asset Crestmont, a thrift based in Edison, N.J., through a tax-free stock swap.
Each share of Crestmont would be exchanged for between one new share and 1.15 new shares of Summit.
Summit expects to incur a one-time $11 million charge from the deal, as well as a $23 million charge related to the disposition of assets, but said the combined company will reduce expenses by $11 million annually.
The company said the transaction should contribute to earnings by early 1995.
As part of the transaction, Summit said it would sell roughly $100 million of Crestmont performing and nonperforming commercial real-estate loans to Lehman Brothers, a unit of American Express Co.
