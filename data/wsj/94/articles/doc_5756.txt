Koo Koo Roo Inc. will post a net loss for the second quarter ended Dec. 28 of around $418,000, or seven cents a share, compared with a net loss of $373,967, or 11 cents a share, on about half as many shares outstanding in the year-earlier period, company executives said.
But revenue for the 13 weeks climbed to more than $1.3 million from $938,366 a year ago, even though the company had one less restaurant in operation, President Michael Mooslin said.
Total shares outstanding rose to 6.2 million in the quarter from 3.4 million a year earlier.
"Our stock isn't an earnings play now.
It's a growth play," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Berg, a former mortgage banker turned restaurateur, said in an interview at the company's West Los Angeles restaurant, where weekly sales have increased 117% from a year earlier.
Throughout the company, samestore sales are running more than 50% ahead of last year, he said.
Mr. Berg hopes Koo Koo Roo, a fast-food chain serving skinless flame-broiled chicken in a deli-type setting, will eventually be a challenger to the successful Boston Chicken restaurants.
He said his "conservative" goal is to have 100 Koo Koo Roo franchises by the end of the year, and to have 1,000 restaurants up and running in five years.
The net loss for the second quarter, he said, stemmed from start-up costs associated with servicing its new franchise operations.
The company currently has seven restaurants, in Southern California, New Jersey and Miami.
It is constructing three more, and has sold or is in the process of selling franchise territories in Florida, Orange County, Calif.; San Francisco, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, Scottsdale, Ariz.; Seattle and Denver, Mr. Berg said.
Koo Koo Roo has been converting all of its restaurants to a "California Kitchen" concept, offering low-fat foods like handcarved turkey, cucumber salad, baked yams and steamed vegetables.
