A federal district court judge in Dallas entered a judgment totaling about $22.3 million in damages and interest against the estate of Box Energy Corp. founder Cloyce K. Box on behalf of the company.
The judgment follows a jury verdict in October 1992 in a suit that made several claims, including mismanagement, against Mr. Box, who died in October.
Mr. Box's estate holds 57% of the voting rights of Box Energy, an oil and gas exploration and production company based in Dallas.
The executors of the estate are two of Mr. Box's sons, Thomas D. Box, company president, and Don D. Box, company chairman.
The company said it is reviewing the judgment and hasn't decided whether to appeal.
