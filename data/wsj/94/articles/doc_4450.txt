Salted Cheerios?
General Mills Inc. will soon introduce a salty-snack mix featuring its most-popular breakfast cereal as well as minicheesy crackers, pretzels and peanuts.
Cheerios Snack Mix will come in two flavors, original and cheddar cheese.
The product is being positioned to compete directly with Chex Mix from cereal rival Ralston Purina Co.
The 8.5 oz. bags of Cheerios Snack Mix will have a suggested retail price of $1.99.
Minneapolis-based General Mills also said at an analysts' conference here that it will soon roll out another snack item, Pop Secret brand Pop Chips, made from popcorn.
Pop Secret is the company's microwavable popcorn.
Pop Chips will be marketed with an eye to the waistline; copy says the chips contain less fat per serving than potato, tortilla, corn and multi-grain versions.
Pop Chips will come in original, butter and sour cream and onion flavors.
A recent presweetened chip called Fingos, marketed as a cereal that doesn't require milk, has performed poorly, company executives admit.
