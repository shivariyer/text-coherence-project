Two big drug companies reported fourth-quarter earnings that largely met expectations, reassuring investors that Pfizer Inc.'s disappointing results on Wednesday didn't signal an industry trend.
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. reported a 56% drop in earnings because of a special charge to settle breast-implant claims, but profit excluding the charge was within forecasts.
American Home Products Corp. reported sales and earnings increases of almost 6%, on target with analysts' estimates.
The companies' share prices remained firm after the earnings announcements.
Bristol-Myers shares ended up at $58.75, unchanged, and American Home Products shares closed at $64.25, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
Meanwhile, Pfizer shares slid 25 cents to $62.625, after falling $5 Wednesday in Big Board trading.
"The importance of the earnings releases yesterday was that they calmed the fears" even though they weren't stellar results, said Mariola B. Haggar, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
After Pfizer announced its earnings, she said, investors were calling, fearful that "if the strongest company in the industry is showing a shortfall, it must mean the weaker companies are going to show a disaster.
And that didn't happen."
Bristol-Myers's earnings fell to $255.8 million, or 50 cents a share, from $583 million, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 6% to $2.99 billion from $2.82 billion.
The most recent quarter included a $500 million pretax special charge to settle pending and future breast-implant product liability claims.
Bristol-Myers's Medical Engineering Corp. unit sold silicon breast implants until 1991, when it withdrew the product from the market after controversy erupted over the safety of breast implants.
The company said the charge includes $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses, offset by $1 billion in expected insurance proceeds.
For the year, Bristol-Myers earned $1.96 billion, or $3.80 a share, flat with the previous year's $1.96 billion, or $3.79 a share.
The 1992 results included gains on the disposal of a business and a charge for accounting changes.
Sales rose 2.3% to $11.41 billion from $11.16 billion.
Excluding the special charge, Bristol-Myers's per-share earnings from continuing operations rose 8% to $1.10, slightly below the consensus forecast but within the range of expectations.
Robert Hodgson, an analyst at Cowen & Co., said the company had "an easier comparison" than usual with the year-earlier results, which had been depressed by large purchases by wholesalers in the third-quarter that "pulled sales into that quarter and out of fourth-quarter."
American Home's net rose 5.9% to $382.7 million, or $1.23 a share, from $361.6 million, or $1.16 a share.
Sales rose 5.7% to $2.12 billion from $2 billion.
For the year, the company posted earnings of $1.47 billion, or $4.73 a share, roughly flat with $1.46 billion, or $4.65 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 5.5% to $8.3 billion from $7.87 billion.
The 1992 results included a $220 million charge related to the company's purchase of Genetics Institute Inc.
Driving much of the growth in the quarter was the strength of consumer health-care products, where sales increased 13%.
A strong flu season gave a boost to cough-and-cold-product sales, analysts said.
