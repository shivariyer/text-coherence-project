The United Steelworkers and Allegheny Ludlum Corp. said they would resume labor contract negotiations today, a week after the talks broke off.
The union ended talks with the specialty steelmaker March 17 after the two sides failed to agree on various issues affecting individual plants.
But yesterday the union said, "These local issues have been settled to the satisfaction of our negotiating committee," adding that it was ready to "resume bargaining on larger contract issues, including economic issues."
The contract, which covers 3,500 workers at six plants, expires March 31.
