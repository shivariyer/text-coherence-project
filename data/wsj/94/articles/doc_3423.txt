South Korea reported its second straight month of trade deficits, with a $478 million gap in February.
In a preliminary report on trade for February, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy blamed a lagging export increase for the continued deficit.
But the February deficit represented a narrowing from the year-earlier deficit of $552 million and January's $1.4 billion deficit.
In February, exports rose 4.8% to $6.22 billion from $5.94 billion a year earlier.
Imports expanded 3.3% to $6.70 billion from $6.49 billion.
The ministry attributed the rise in exports and imports to three fewer trading days than in the year-earlier period.
