Five minutes before its expiration, New York's banking deregulation law, which among other things kept caps off most loan and credit-card rates, was extended permanently.
The state's 13-year-old law allowing banks to set rates was scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EST yesterday.
Lawmakers worked into the night to resolve several sticking points in the new, wide-ranging banking bill, including how to allocate money for small-business development.
Once passed, Gov. Mario Cuomo signed the bill on the Assembly floor to make sure the law didn't lapse.
In addition to allowing banks to set loans rates and creating new small-business investment programs, the law provides for new auto-lease-term disclosure requirements; a consumer auto-leasing grievance procedure; the creation of a consumer 800 number for information on credit-card rates and terms; and a requirement that banks set up low-cost checking accounts for poor people.
