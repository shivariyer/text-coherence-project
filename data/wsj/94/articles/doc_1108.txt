Scott Bleier, vice president of technical research at Josephthal Lyon & Ross, said Nasdaq stocks typically lead the primary markets, noting that while Big Board issues have languished recently, the Nasdaq composite index hit a series of new highs.
The drop in the Nasdaq composite index yesterday "allows the markets to get into equilibrium," he said.
While the tightening of monetary policy often sends shivers down stock investors' spines, analysts were quick to note that yesterday's Fed announcement was the least drastic move the centeral bank could take, short of not changing policy at all.
The Fed is widely seen as having raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.5%.
There had been speculation the central bank would boost the funds rate by half a percentage point, or even raise the discount rate.
Because yesterday's move was relatively limited, many analysts expect to see stock prices move higher.
"We will go on to new highs," said Mr. Bleier of Josephthal Lyon.
He expects the market to be driven by strength in the economy and because "merger mania will continue."
"The leadership from small-cap stocks will continue" despite the Fed's tightening, said Greg Kuhn, head of Kuhn Asset Management.
But Mr. Kuhn cautioned that the change in the trend of interest rates "removed the most bullish prop" from the stock market and that eventually higher rates will take their toll.
