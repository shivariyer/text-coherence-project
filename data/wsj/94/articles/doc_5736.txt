Sales rose 1.7% to $582.8 million from $573 million.
Excluding a series of unusual items, Manville in Denver, would have had a profit in the latest period of about $7.7 million, or two cents a share, compared with year-earlier profit of about $1.3 million, or a per-share loss of three cents after allowing for preferred stock dividends.
Manville said operating profit before unusual items at its Riverwood International Corp. paper-products unit fell 49% due in part to weak linerboard prices.

The results were released after the stock market closed.
