Ontario Hydro reached a last-minute agreement with union negotiators, narrowly averting a strike that would have led to power cuts throughout the province.
The premier of Ontario, Bob Rae, intervened late Sunday and ordered both sides to return to the negotiating table.
"We were told that if we didn't resolve this, he would resolve it for us in a manner neither of us would like," said John Murphy, president of the Power Workers' Union, which represents the utility's 14,700 unionized employees.
Details of the tentative agreement weren't disclosed, but Mr. Murphy said it resolves concerns over job security.
In the past year, the state-owned utility has eliminated 6,000 positions, facing falling revenue and a heavy debt load.
Maurice Strong, Ontario Hydro chairman, said the new pact won't add anything to electricity rates, which remained flat this year after several years of hefty increases.
The utility is seeking a 1.4% rate increase for 1995.
Mr. Murphy said the union's board will recommend unanimously that its members approve the agreement.
Ontario Hydro yesterday began shutting down its nuclear-generating facilities in anticipation of a strike.
Mr. Strong said that process will be reversed, and there will be no danger of any power shortfall in the province.
