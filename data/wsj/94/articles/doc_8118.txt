Unisys Corp., citing weak computer sales overseas partially offset by gains in the U.S., said fourth-quarter net income slipped 15% to $117.7 million, or 53 cents a share, from $139.2 million, or 66 cents a share.
The year-ago quarter included a onetime gain of $38 million, or 23 cents a share, from an operating loss carry-forward.
Revenue for the quarter fell 6.9% to $2.1 billion from $2.26 billion.
But the Blue Bell, Pa., company said its fourth-quarter orders showed good growth, including the strongest gains in its U.S. commercial business in five years.
