Cyrus R. Vance, the court-appointed mediator in the R.H. Macy & Co. bankruptcy proceeding, has given the retailer time to sell its proposed reorganization plan to its creditors.
After meeting with Mr. Vance yesterday, Federated Department Stores Inc., Macy's suitor and one of its senior creditors, said it was asked by Mr. Vance to "refrain" from submitting terms of a proposed reorganization plan, so Macy can talk with other creditors.
Earlier this week, Macy unveiled terms of its plan under which creditors get cash and securities valued at $3.6 billion when the company emerges from bankruptcy court protection in 1995, and possibly $500 million more in securities later.
Cincinnati-based Federated, which wants to merge the two department store chains, said in a statement yesterday it was committed to "working within the mediation process" and would abide by Mr. Vance's request.
But it appears Mr. Vance, a partner in Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, will give Federated ample time to present its case.
Mr. Vance plans to meet with Macy's creditors, including Federated, during the week of April 11.
After those meetings, Federated said Mr. Vance will "provide direction to Federated regarding its desire to initiate discussions with other Macy creditors" on Federated's proposal for a plan of reorganization for Macy.
Simpson Thacher confirmed Federated's statement.
