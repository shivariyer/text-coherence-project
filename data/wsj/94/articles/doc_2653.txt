Your Tracking Travel column Jan. 25 had a little fun at the expense of the agents and inspectors who failed to catch an expired passport, certainly something that they're supposed to notice.
I must point out, however, that you failed to notice the story refers to "the Lufthansa ticket-counter agent at Washington's National Airport."
Since Lufthansa does not and cannot fly from Washington's National Airport (you obviously meant Dulles), I can only assume you made the same kind of rush-rush oversight error that your story's subjects made.
A bit ironic, huh?
