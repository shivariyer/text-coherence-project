In your Jan. 28 Washington Wire, you report that I have found a "new villain" in explaining away the economy's strength: "`If Clinton's tax increases don't choke off growth,' he says, `the health plan will.'"
This is not what I told your reporter.
In fact, my forecasts have been bullish on the financial markets and real economy for the last 18 months and continue to be.
I said the Clinton tax increases had already been discounted by the financial markets.
They are detracting from the economy's performance, but are being overwhelmed by the positive contribution of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.
With the support of the president, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan continues to restore the confidence of the nation's creditors in the value of U.S. debt, which is why they are willing to buy it at ever lower interest rates.
For this reason, I have advised our domestic and international clients to expect a 5.5% yield on the 30-year bond in 1994.
Regarding the president's health care plan, I said it would cripple the economy if it passed as proposed, but that I believed there was no chance of that.
Republican leadership in Congress has already indicated it cannot support a plan that will smother capital formation or burden small business.
This is reason enough to expect the legislation that emerges to also have positive effects.
