The Internal Revenue Service dropped a tax case against executives of Montgomery Ward & Co., including its chairman, that stemmed from the 1988 management-led buyout of the retailer.
The tax agency didn't explain its decision to drop the case, in which it sought $149 million in back taxes.
But the IRS action quiets concerns that the case had raised about leveraged buyouts.
The IRS had alleged that Chairman Bernard F. Brennan and 51 other participants paid less than fair market value for their shares.
The executives paid $1 a share for a 50% interest in the retail concern, as part of the $3.8 billion buyout transaction.
In June 1992, the IRS, which claimed that the real value of the shares at the time of the transaction was $83 a share, sought to compel the executives to pay taxes and interest on the difference, which it viewed as compensation.
General Electric Capital Corp., a unit of General Electric Co., which purchased the remaining 50% of Montgomery Ward in the transaction, was not involved in the tax issue.
But the fact that General Electric paid the same amount for its shares as did the Montgomery Ward officials gave weight to the executives' case, said Stuart Seigel, Mr. Brennan's attorney.
"There was concern that this issue could be extended to other LBO situations if the government prevailed in this case," Mr. Seigel said.
