Coca-Cola Co.'s Japanese subsidiary said it will appeal Japan's demand for $140 million in back taxes, and said any decision on the matter would have a "negligible" financial impact.
The National Tax Administration of Japan claims that royalties paid by the Coca-Cola subsidiary to its parent company from 1990 to 1992 were too high, and it demanded payment in additional taxes.
The matter will be reviewed under the treaty signed by U.S. and Japanese tax authorities.
A Coca-Cola representative said that if Japan prevails, the taxes would be shifted from the U.S. government to Japan, so there wouldn't be any real financial impact on the company.
