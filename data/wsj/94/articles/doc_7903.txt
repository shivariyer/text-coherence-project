Your Dec. 22 article on IRA withdrawals correctly focused on delaying or minimizing required distributions.
There are, however, occasions when receiving distributions before the necessary payout date can actually reduce the overall tax bite.
This is because of the 15% excess distributions excise tax on annual withdrawals over $150,000.
In very large IRA rollovers, we are finding more individuals whose required distributions can throw the taxpayer over the $150,000 threshold for this special tax.
Taking early distributions may therefore keep the taxpayer under the threshold amount.
The rule here, as in most parts of the tax code, is "work the numbers and don't assume."
