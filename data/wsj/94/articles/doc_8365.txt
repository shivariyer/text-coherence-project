Canadian manufacturers' shipments increased in November for the fourth consecutive month, rising 0.5% from October, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
The rise was led by the primary metal, wood and chemical industries.
Shipments by the auto industry declined 2.7% in November, mainly because of some temporary plant closures for model changes.
Manufacturers recorded a 1% rise in new orders in November, but their backlog of unfilled orders declined 0.7%.
