Donald Trump's partner in the Grand Hyatt hotel sued the real estate developer and his bankers over their handling of his interest in the midtown Manhattan hotel.
The suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan against Mr. Trump, Chemical Banking Corp. and Bankers Trust New York Corp., seeks a declaration that he has defaulted in his financial obligations to the hotel and no longer can participate in its management.
In the alternative, it seeks an order directing the defendants to contribute their share of necessary renovation funds.
The banks declined to comment on the latest lawsuit.
The suit, filed by Refco Properties Inc., an affiliate of Hyatt Corp., also seeks $100 million in compensatory damages, as well as punitive damages.
The suit asserts that Mr. Trump transferred his interest in the hotel to the banks secretly in order to conceal his financial difficulties.
Such a transfer, the suit says, required the partner's approval.
Last July, Mr. Trump sued Hyatt Corp., seeking to have the company dismissed as manager of the hotel, and to be awarded exclusive ownership, as well as more than $500 million in damages.
