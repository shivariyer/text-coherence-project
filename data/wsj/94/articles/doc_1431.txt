The union representing 3,500 workers at Allegheny Ludlum Corp. said it broke off contract negotiations with the company.
The current contract, covering 3,500 workers at six plants, expires March 31.
The United Steelworkers of America said the company "refused to move on fundamental issues of overriding concern to our membership," including seniority in job assignments.
"The company's arrogant responses to these issues show that they have no intention of dealing fairly with the union on the broader contractual issues on the table."
A spokesman for Allegheny Ludlum, the nation's largest stainless steel maker, said it was "disappointed about the delay."
"Things had been going well," he said, and the two parties were down to their final local issues before moving on to the larger issues of wages and benefits.
The United Steelworkers represent workers at six plant locations in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and New York.
