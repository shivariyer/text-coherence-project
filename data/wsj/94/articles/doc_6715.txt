Attorney General Janet Reno issued procedures designed to speed the release of documents in cases of "extraordinary interest to the news media."
Under the new procedures, the department's director of public affairs may move a Freedom of Information Act request ahead of others if there is exceptional media interest in the case and if the information concerns questions relating to governmental integrity.
The Justice Department said Ms. Reno authorized an exemption to the "first-in, first-out processing" after asking why it is taking so long to process requests for reports relating to the death of Vincent Foster, who was deputy White House counsel and President Clinton's personal lawyer.
Though the Foster case led to the new policy, those records may not be immediately released under it, said Carl Stern, the department's director of public affairs.
Before the Foster documents are released, they will have to be reviewed by independent counsel Robert Fiske, who is investigating matters linked to Mr. Foster's death, Mr. Stern explained.
The editor of The Wall Street Journal sued the Justice Department last week because it hasn't provided documents requested in August under the FOIA or given a reason why it has not.
