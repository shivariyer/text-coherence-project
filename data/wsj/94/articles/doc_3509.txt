Zapata Corp., Houston, said its board recommended a 1-for-5 reverse split of common stock and an annual dividend of 14 cents a share.
Stockholders of record March 23 will be eligible to vote on the reverse split at the annual meeting April 27.
The split would result in about 31.7 million shares outstanding.
If the split is approved, a quarterly dividend of 3.5 cents a share will be paid, beginning in July, to holders of record June 30.
That dividend equals a quarterly cash distribution of about $1.1 million, the natural-gas company said.
Zapata Chairman and Chief Executive Officer R.C. Lassiter said the board believes reducing the number of shares will attract investors and increase the stock's price, now too low for some investors.
The company also said B. John Mackin retired from the board, which voted to reduce its membership to seven from eight this year and to six in 1995.
