University of Wisconsin football fans who discovered too late they had no Rose Bowl tickets have badgered federal officials into expanding a rule that protects pro-football fans from such mishaps.
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena is expected to propose today that the rule, which requires tour-package operators to have Super Bowl tickets in hand if the deal they are marketing includes tickets, be extended to any college-football bowl game and the Final Four college-basketball tournament games.
Sen. Herb Kohl (D., Wis.) introduced legislation Tuesday to accomplish the same thing, saying that as many as 2,000 Badger fans purchased travel packages for the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl, and then arrived in California to find out the tickets didn't exist.
"Hundreds of those had to watch the event on TV in a room nearby the stadium," Mr. Kohl said.
The Transportation Department, which enacted the Super Bowl rule in 1980, said it hasn't detected any violations in recent years.
Expanding the rule requires a formal rule-making proceeding, including a period for public comment.
