Chrysler Corp. said it will close its Marine & Industrial Division in Beaver Dam, Wis., in this year's third quarter, dismissing 29 people.
The operation, located in Beaver Dam since 1970, equips Chrysler engines and other powertrain components for marine, industrial and other applications in motor homes, forklifts and boats.
The auto maker said the move is in line with continuing efforts to focus on its core automotive business.
