Discount fares drove Greyhound Lines Inc. to a deeper-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter of 1993 as the bus carrier tried to reverse a decline in passenger traffic.
The Dallas company reported a net loss of $6.4 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with earnings of $5.3 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue fell 7.5% to $155.1 million from $167.7 million.
For the year, Greyhound posted profit of just $7.5 million, or 57 cents a share.
In 1992, Greyhound earned $10.9 million, or $1.10 a share.
Revenue declined nearly 4% to $666.5 million from $693 million.
"The 1993 results were very disappointing," said Frank J. Schmieder, chief executive and president.
He attributed the disappointment to sluggishness in the travel industry, bad winter weather and problems in the third quarter with a new reservation system and telephone service.
