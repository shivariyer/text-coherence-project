SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it issued 30,000 of its shares to the city of St. Petersburg for a 15% stake in one of Russia's oldest and largest drug companies.
The company, Leningrad Industrial Chemical & Pharmaceutical Association (Oktyabr), formed a joint venture with SPI last year to build a new $40 million plant in St. Petersburg.
SPI shares closed at $16.625, down 25 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading.
SPI is 42%-owned by ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.
SPI said it also offered to purchase the city's remaining 33% Oktyabr stake in exchange for various marketing, training and other services.
SPI also offered to acquire the estimated 40% stake owned by Oktyabr's 2,175 workers in exchange for up to 137,000 SPI shares.
SPI has about 18 million shares outstanding.
When the Russian company was privatized last year, its workers received vouchers equal to about a 51% stake.
But that has since fallen to about 40% because some workers have sold vouchers in "informal markets," SPI said.
