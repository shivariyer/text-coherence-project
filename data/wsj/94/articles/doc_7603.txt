Crossland Federal Savings Bank, New York, said fourth-quarter earnings soared because of a sharp drop in the cost of bad debts.
Crossland reported net income of $13.4 million, or $1.09 a share, compared with the year-earlier $844,000.
The provision for loan losses fell to $3 million from $12 million.
Nonperforming assets dropped sharply.
For the full year, the $4.5 billion-asset savings bank reported a net loss of $189 million, compared with 1992 profit of $422 million.
The 1993 results include a $185.9 restructuring charge related to the company's initial public offering last August.
Crossland didn't give per-share figures for the year earlier.
