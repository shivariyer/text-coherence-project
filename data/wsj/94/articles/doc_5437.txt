Greg Gumbel seems to have discovered the secret of good anchoring: Keep a low profile.
Instead of hogging air time, Mr. Gumbel is relatively rarely seen and when he does appear, he is effective.
Just contrast two interviews with downhill winner Tommy Moe.
On Sunday night, Mr. Gumbel's was to-the-point and interesting.
On Monday morning, Harry Smith's was awkward and tedious.
Speaking of tedious!
CBS brought a little taste of tabloid TV to the Games by airing a garish re-creation of the neo-Nazi attack on American lugers last year in Germany.
Makes one shudder at what the network could do when Tonya Harding arrives in Lillehammer.
CBS gave more air time to the men's downhill than it has allotted to Alpine events in past Olympics.
Can it be the network realizes fans want to see lots of skiing?
Or, is it just that Mr. Moe carried off the gold?
CBS allowed a bit of drama on its morning show yesterday by airing live Dan Jansen's latest Olympic disappointment.
CBS's Sunday prime-time audience was the largest ever for a single night of Olympics coverage, winter or summer.
An estimated 82 million people watched all or part of the coverage.
CBS drew 29.2% of the nation's TV households, compared with 23.5% for the first Sunday night of the 1992 Winter Games, as compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co.
In overnight ratings from 30 major cities, CBS once again routed its rivals with ratings of 28.7% to 10.7% each for NBC and ABC.
Scott Hamilton is amazing.
The skating commentator knows how other people are feeling.
"She's not feeling any pain right now, I guarantee," he remarked as Isabelle Brasseur of Canada skated with bruised ribs in the pairs competition.
But Mr. Hamilton's powers pale beside those of Tamara Moskvina, coach of the gold medal pairs winners at Albertville.
After her skaters suffered through a miserable practice, she assured CBS cameras that she would hypnotize them.
Before they skated she declared that the hypnotism had worked.
And, they skated brilliantly.
