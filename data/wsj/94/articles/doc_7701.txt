Powell Industries Inc. said one of its units will receive $13 million from the state of Massachusetts to install computer-controlled highway surveillance and traffic control devices.
Powell said that figure represents the unit's share of a $52 million contract awarded to a joint venture of Perini Corp., based in Framingham, Mass., and the Powell unit, Transdyn Controls Inc.
For its fiscal year ended Oct. 31, Powell earned $2.9 million, or 28 cents a share, after an accounting adjustment, on revenue of $138.1 million.
