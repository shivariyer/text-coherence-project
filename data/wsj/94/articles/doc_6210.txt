The Securities and Exchange Commission extended the public comment period on a controversial proposal designed to sever links between municipal bond dealers' political gifts to state and local officials and the awarding of bond business.
The new March 11 deadline represents a one-month extension for comment on the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's proposal to end the "pay-to-play" practice.
It also represents regulators' recognition that the proposal is generating strong and growing opposition among state and local officials.
Several groups, including the Government Finance Officers Association and National League of Cities, complained that the Feb. 11 deadline for comments set by the SEC didn't provide enough time to assess the plan.
The extension was requested by the rulemaking board, a self-regulatory body subject to SEC oversight, and was approved by the SEC.
Separately, the League challenged the SEC to document the need for the proposed rule, which would bar dealers from doing business with a bond issuer within two years of either the dealer, its political action committee, or its municipal finance professionals making a political gift to an issuer official.
