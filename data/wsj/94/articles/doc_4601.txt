Home Shopping Network Inc. intends to expand into Japan through a proposed alliance with its majority owner, Tele-Communications Inc., and Japan's Sumitomo Corp.
The venture, outlined in a letter of intent among the three companies, would mark the television home-shopping giant's first attempt to crack a foreign market since an earlier effort failed last year.
Home Shopping was outmaneuvered by rival QVC Inc., which snared a joint venture in England that Home Shopping had expected to conclude with News Corp.'s 50%-owned BSkyB home satellite-TV venture.
The two home-shopping concerns, which virtually constitute the entire U.S. industry, are staking out international markets to boost growth.
Home Shopping, which pioneered the industry in the U.S., described the letter of intent as "a first step" toward establishing the Japanese TV home-shopping service.
It said it envisioned enticing other major Japanese companies to join the venture and anticipates launching the operations within a year.
Sumitomo, one of Japan's major industrial combines, with the nation's largest cable-television holdings, already has close programming ties with Tele-Communications, the largest cable operator in the U.S.
Although international expansion offers growth opportunities for both QVC and Home Shopping, profits from foreign ventures are at least two years away, analysts estimate.
"It's a long-term position," noted Craig Bibb, an analyst with PaineWebber.
"Nobody's making any money and won't for two or three years."
