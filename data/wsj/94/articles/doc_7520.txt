General Tire Inc. announced a price increase of 3% to 4% on its private-label tires for the replacement market.
The move by the unit of Germany's Continental AG, follows similar price increases in recent weeks by rival tire makers.
General Tire said the increase, "necessitated by rising costs," takes effect April 1 and covers passenger, light-truck and farm tires for the market.
The company's last private-label tire price increase was April 1992.
