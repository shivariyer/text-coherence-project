Canada's West Coast ports have been paralyzed by a longshoremen's contract dispute.
The walkout, which started Thursday, has halted movement of grain, lumber and other commodities and has prompted some shippers to order their container cargo to be diverted to Seattle.
The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union called the strike in support of its wage demands, which include an increase of 95 Canadian cents (US72 cents) an hour in the first year of a three-year contract.
The current base rate is C$21.41 an hour.
The union has been without a contract since Dec. 31, 1992.
The union offered to continue loading grain at West Coast ports to "avoid undue hardship to farmers."
But the British Columbia Maritime Employers' Association rejected the offer.
A spokesman for the association, which represents maritime industries, said: "We either move all cargo that we handle or we don't move cargo.
We can't be selective."
The Canadian government hasn't indicated how it intends to respond to the work stoppage.
The most recent major West Coast port shutdown in 1986 was ended by legislation that ordered a return to work and imposed a procedure for settling the contract dispute.
