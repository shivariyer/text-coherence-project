Nintendo Co.'s U.S. unit announced a $59.99 device that allows software for its handheld Game Boy player to be played on television sets through its standard video game system.
The device, called Super Game Boy, fits in a cartridge slot in the company's Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
It converts black-and-white images to varying shades of four colors on the television screen, and allows players to customize colors and designs, Nintendo of America said.
