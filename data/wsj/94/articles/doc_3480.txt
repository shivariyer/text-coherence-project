Miller Brewing Co. has canceled television and print advertisements in the wake of a government investigation into whether Miller was illegally marketing its ice beer on the basis of its alcohol content.
Most ice beer, which is brewed at temperatures so cold that ice crystals form, is about 5.5% alcohol by volume, compared with 4.5% to 5% for regular and light beers.
It is against federal law to trumpet a beer's alcoholic content in advertising.
Officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were said to be troubled by a commercial for Miller's Molson Ice that panned a label displaying a 5.6% alcoholic content.
Miller, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., said the BATF had not ordered the company to discontinue the ads.
"To avoid any perception that we are marketing our products on the basis of alcohol strength, we have decided not to feature the approved government label in our advertising," said a Miller spokeswoman.
Separately, the state of Alabama said it had ordered Miller and other brewers to stop selling ice beer in order to comply with a state law that doesn't allow beer with an alcohol content of more than 5% to be sold.
Miller said it will rebrew the beer at that level so it can be sold in that state.
