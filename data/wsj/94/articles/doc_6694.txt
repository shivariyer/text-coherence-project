The chairmen of two House subcommittees are questioning the ability of the Securities and Exchange Commission to supervise public utility companies that enter the telecommunications business.
Democratic Reps. Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Philip Sharp of Indiana said utility companies' proposals to add telecommunications to their business portfolios "raise a profound public-policy issue concerning whether multistate electric utilities would be effectively regulated if they were allowed to diversify into fields not related to their core energy businesses."
The SEC oversees public utility holding companies and must approve the companies' diversification into other businesses.
The SEC's oversight dates back to legislation that followed the 1929 stock-market crash.
Earlier this week, Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.) suggested that he would offer legislation giving utility companies a blanket exemption from SEC regulations that could prohibit their joining the telecommunications business.
Mr. Boucher's declaration prompted Mr. Markey, chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, and Mr. Sharp, chairman of the House Energy and Power Subcommittee, to direct a series of questions to SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt regarding the status of any utility company requests to enter the telecommunications business and the ability of the SEC to regulate such wide-ranging interests.
Mr. Boucher also signed the letter to Mr. Levitt.
