The Texas Economic Index, a weekly leading indicator, fell to 111.22 from a revised 111.29 the prior week.
But the annual change in the index rose to 2.84% from 2.7%, suggesting a mild upturn in the state's economic-growth rate.
Contributing to the year-over-year increase: The help wanted index rose in early January, initial unemployment claims fell, and consumer confidence jumped.
Note: All figures are statewide, except for the U.S. Short Leading Index, which is national, and the Consumer Confidence Index, which tracks Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas
