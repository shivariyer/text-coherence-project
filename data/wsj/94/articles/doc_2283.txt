State prosecutors said an associate of defunct Oxford Capital Securities Inc. pleaded guilty to charges he took part in an illegal investment plan that earned more than $10 million.
The New York County district attorney's office said David Greene pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud, six counts of violating New York's securities-fraud law, two counts of grand larceny in the second degree and one count of grand larceny in the third degree.
Mr. Greene was among 13 people indicted in March 1993 on charges of taking part in fraud prosecutors characterized as a "Ponzi scheme," in which new investments are used to pay previous investors.
Mr. Greene, who faces a possible two-year to six-year sentence, admitted to obtaining by theft or fraud $598,588, according to prosecutors.
Mr. Greene agreed to repay $361,937.
Oxford Capital Securities was suspended by the National Association of Securities Dealers in March 1993 for denying NASD staff access to books and records.
