The major vendors of the Unix operating system software agreed yesterday to work on making their products compatible with each other, marking an end to a longstanding schism in the industry.
The agreement came as several new companies -- including Sun Microsystems Inc. -- agreed to join the Open Software Foundation, an industry group.
Unix is the operating system that runs on workstations.
There are currently about half a dozen different versions of Unix on the market, down from about 200 six years ago.
In a news release, the Open Software Foundation called the new alliance "a new era of cooperation."
