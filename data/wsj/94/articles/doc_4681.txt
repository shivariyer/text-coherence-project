Spy, the hip, satirical magazine that has brashly taken on politicians, celebrities and entrepreneurs, has ceased publication after failing to find a buyer.
The magazine, which published for seven and one-half years, had a circulation of about 200,000.
Majority owner Jean Pigozzi had tried to find a buyer for months.
Circulation director Elaine Alimonti said the magazine's circulation and advertising revenue had been growing about 20% a year.
"Everything was going well," she said.
Magazine staffers once called 20 first-year congressmen to ask how to curb ethnic cleansing in Fredonia, the fictitious country in the Marx Brothers film "Duck Soup."
Answers ranged from, "It's a different situation than the Middle East" to, "Take action."
