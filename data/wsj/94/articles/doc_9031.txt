Wholesale sales of western German home textiles fell an inflation-adjusted 4% in the 11-month span from January through November compared with the same period in 1992.
The Federal Statistics Office, which released the figures in a special report on the sector, didn't give a report for all 12 months of 1993.
Home textiles are one branch within the western German wholesale sector.
From 1987 through 1991, the western German textile branch posted a real gain of 6%, the agency said.
In 1992, the same branch in western Germany had a 5.7% real drop in wholesale sales.
