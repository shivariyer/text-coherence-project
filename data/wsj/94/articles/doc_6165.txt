Eastman Kodak Co. and the Associated Press introduced a jointly developed filmless camera, the first of its kind designed specifically for news photographers.
The NewsCamera 2000 will be distributed exclusively by New York-based AP, which will buy the cameras from Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., and sell them to member newspapers, subscribers and others.
The cost is about $26,000 for the camera, three removable, reusable memory cartridges and a portable scanner and transmitter.
But the device could save film and developing costs, an AP official said.
The digital camera captures images as computer data rather than as chemical changes on film.
Photographers on deadline, therefore can shoot pictures and deliver them electronically through a phone to newspapers without leaving the scene or hassling with development.
Digital cameras aren't new, although the NC 2000 is the "only one out there devoted to photojournalism," is faster and works in more varied lighting, said John Larish, an electronic-imaging consultant.
The alliance is mutually beneficial to AP, where swiftness is crucial for the news wire service, and to Kodak, which has a niche market for such cameras.
Orders won't be filled for more than a month.
