Ashland Coal Inc. said severe weather and the aftereffects from last year's mine workers strike will reduce first-quarter earnings to about the break-even level.
In the 1993 first quarter, Ashland Coal earned $1.5 million, or six cents a share, excluding accounting adjustments.
Revenue totaled $138.2 million.
The Huntington, W.Va., coal mining concern said despite high costs in January, the average cost per ton for the year should approximate the 1992 level.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading, Ashland Coal was quoted at $29.125, off 37.5 cents.
