Chia Hsin Cement Corp. announced in Taipei, Taiwan, plans to invest $120 million in a new cement plant in the Philippines.
Construction could start as early as the second half of 1994, Ko Tsu Kang, vice president of Chia Hsin, said.
The plan will be financed with proceeds from a Eurobond issue, Mr. Ko added.
The Chia Hsin plan has been approved by the Investment Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and is awaiting Securities and Exchange Commission endorsement before it can proceed.
Taiwan is facing a cement crunch in 1997 when mining rights on its east coast expire and domestic cement production could be cut 40% overnight, said Andrew Clarke, research analyst for Wardley James Capel Taiwan Ltd.
