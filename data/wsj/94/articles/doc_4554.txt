The Defense Department said it is evaluating a proposal by Martin Marietta Corp. that would allow the company to renegotiate its U.S. space-launch contracts.
The Bethesda, Md., company had notified the Pentagon that it would abandon its tentative $208.5 million purchase of General Dynamics Corp.'s space-launch business unless the government were willing to share with Martin Marietta some of the $400 million that the U.S. could save over 10 years by the purchase.
It wasn't clear whether the federal review would delay a final agreement between Martin Marietta and General Dynamics, which was expected by April 30.
The evaluation "isn't yet complete," said a military spokesman.
Martin Marietta wants to merge its Titan IV heavy-launch rocket business with General Dynamics' medium-lift Atlas-Centaur system.
Martin Marietta has said that the deal doesn't make sense unless it is allowed to renegotiate the terms of its Titan contracts.
