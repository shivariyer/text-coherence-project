Pacific Telesis International said its Proto Italia consortium filed a prequalification application to operate Italy's second digital cellular network.
Companies who pass this stage can then formally apply for the cellular license.
A final decision on the operator is expected by the end of the year.
The government-owned telephone operator, Societa Italiana per l'Esercizio Telefoni, is currently the only company providing cellular service.
Pacific Telesis, a subsidiary of Pacific Telesis Group, a San Francisco telecommunications company, owns a 33% interest in the consortium along with German and Italian investors.
