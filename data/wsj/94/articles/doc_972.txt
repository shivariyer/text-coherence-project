ITT's chairman, president and chief executive officer, Rand V. Araskog, received a bonus of $2,584,900 for 1993; he had received a $1.4 million bonus two years ago.
Mr. Araskog's salary last year totaled $1,525,000, up from $1,462,500 a year ago.
And ITT's compensation committee said it authorized a $100,000 salary increase effective Jan. 1, 1994, bringing his annual salary to $1,625,000.
The proxy said the merit increase, 18 months after the last salary review, was equal to 4.3% a year and reflected "the committee's evaluation of his performance during the measurement period."
Mr. Araskog also received other annual compensation totaling $185,793.
Also in the last year, Mr. Araskog realized $5.8 million from exercising options on ITT common shares.
ITT has a precise formula for calculating bonus payments, reflecting performance goals and weighted measures such as per-share earnings and return on equity.
ITT's proxy said the hefty bonuses this year "reflect the significant improvement in profitability over 1992 results."
In 1993, ITT reported net income of $913 million, or $7.32 a share, compared with a net loss of $885 million, or $7.93 a share, in 1992.
The 1992 year included more than $1 billion in extraordinary charges.
The proxy statement also detailed payments to four other top officers: Howard J. Aibel, executive vice president and chief legal officer, salary $710,000, bonus $589,700, and other annual compensation, $71,574; Robert A. Bowman, executive vice president and chief financial officer, salary $416,667, bonus $540,300, and other annual compensation $368,537; Dale R. Comey, executive vice president, salary $575,000, bonus $731,000, and other annual compensation $18,890; and D. Travis Engen, executive vice president, salary $541,667, bonus $731,000, and other annual compensation $13,043.
