Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. said it won a contract from a Chevron Corp. unit for engineering, design and construction of a $290 million modernization project at Chevron's Richmond, Calif., refinery.
The work at the so-called fluid-catalytic cracking unit will increase the conversion of feedstocks to more valuable light products and improve energy efficiency when it is completed in late 1995.
A spokesman for the engineering concern said the value to Jacobs represents substantially all of the total value of the project.
