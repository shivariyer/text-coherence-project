ValueVision International Inc., Minneapolis, said it plans to launch a $134 million two-step tender offer for National Media Corp., which spurned a slightly lower bid last week.
ValueVision, the nation's third-largest home-shopping network, said it plans by Wednesday to offer $10.50 a share in cash for 5.83 million shares of National Media, a Philadelphia-based television marketer.
ValueVision said that block plus the 1.2 million shares it already owns would represent 50.2% of National Media.
ValueVision said it plans to then offer $10.50 in ValueVision stock for each of the remaining National Media shares.
National Media had rejected a $10-a-share offer by ValueVision as inadequate.
National Media executives couldn't be reached for comment.
ValueVision said its offering is subject to, among other things, financing and National Media neutralizing a preferred-stock purchase-rights plan.
