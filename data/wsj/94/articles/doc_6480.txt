Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it will record a special gain of about 19 million Canadian dollars (U.S.$14.3 million) from the sale of a portfolio of residential mortgages in Britain to Abbey National PLC.
Canadian Imperial said the portfolio has a face value of 900 million (U.S.$1.34 billion) of mortgages, about 10% of which are nonperforming.
The Toronto bank said the sale fits with its strategy of concentrating on its North American operations.
Canadian Imperial said it has another British mortgage portfolio, with a face value of 241 million pounds, that it plans to sell over the next few months.
Abbey National, a British building society, which is similar to a savings and loan, said in a statement that the purchase is part of its strategy to increase its share of the U.K. residential mortgage market.
