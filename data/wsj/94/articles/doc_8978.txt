The White House said the government will decide in late summer or early fall which cities and rural areas will get $3.5 billion in federal tax credits and grants as part of a plan to revive economically blighted areas, Vice President Al Gore said.
The selections, coming just in time for mid-term elections, will grace five large cities, one mid-sized city and three rural areas as part of legislation passed in last year's deficit-reduction package.
The so-called "empowerment zones" will share $2.5 billion in tax incentives, mostly wage credits to those who hire residents of the zones, and social service grants totaling $720 million.
They also will get authority to finance a variety of businesses with special tax-exempt bonds.
Another 95 "enterprise communities" will share $280 million in grants and authority to use the special bond rules.
President Clinton, in announcing the availability of applications for the aid program, called it "a new compact to help distressed communities."
The program differs from long-standing Republican models for "enterprise zones," which relied on tax breaks for hundreds of areas and capital-gains tax relief to investors in the zones.
