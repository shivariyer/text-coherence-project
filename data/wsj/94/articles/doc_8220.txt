General Instrument Corp. shares dropped $2.50 on heavy trading following reports that a major order for its cable converters by Tele-Communications Inc. has been delayed.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, General Instrument shares fell 4.2% to $57.375 on volume of 2.3 million shares, almost five times average volume.
The plunge followed a report in this newspaper that TCI, which had planned to deploy the new boxes in early 1994, would wait until late 1994 or early 1995 to roll them out because technical standards had not been finalized by the Moving Picture Experts Group.
The new converter boxes incorporate a new technology known as digital compression, which vastly increases channel capacity, and are a critical link to providing subscribers with movies on demand and other interactive services.
Company officials said the delay wasn't new and that both General Instrument and TCI have been operating under the revised schedule for "many months."
They added that analysts following the company were told of the new delivery schedule in a conference call in October.
However, officials didn't mention the previous announcement when contacted last week, and neither company made news of the delay public.
A spokesman for TCI said, "We anticipate making up the delay when we deploy these boxes later this year, in 1995 and in 1996.
We don't think this is a significant setback."
