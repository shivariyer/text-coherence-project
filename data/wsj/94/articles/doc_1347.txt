Your article Feb. 24 about the unexpected triumphs of the U.S. Ski Team at the Lillehammer Olympics claimed that the U.S. male skiers had a 20-year drought in Olympic medals results ranging from Billy Kidd's silver and Jimmy Huega's bronze in 1964, until Bill Johnson's Gold in 1984.
However, on Feb. 22, 1980, in Lake Placid, on a cold Adirondack morning, Phil Mahre won a silver medal in slalom, ending the 16-year dry spell.
I was fortunate to witness that race at Whiteface Mountain, but that was just the beginning of a memorable day in U.S. Olympic history.
Later that afternoon, the young, amateur U.S. Hockey Team stunned the world by defeating the Soviet Russian hockey team 4-3, at the height of the Cold War.
The U.S. Ski Team and the U.S. Hockey Team have had only occasional bursts of brilliance, but they should be highly commended because they still generally operate as amateur teams, in comparison with their professional international competitors.
