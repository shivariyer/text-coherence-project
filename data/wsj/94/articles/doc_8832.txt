Two defense contractors will pay $12 million to settle charges that they cheated the Pentagon on a cluster-bomb contract, Clinton administration officials said.
Alliant Techsystems Inc., Edina, Minn., and GenCorp Inc.'s Aerojet Ordnance Division, Downey, Calif., will jointly pay a $4 million fine and will take $8 million off a $133.6 million cluster-bomb contract under a consent decree being filed in U.S. District Court in Rock Island, Ill., officials of the Defense and Justice departments said.
Federal officials had charged the companies with colluding to eliminate competition between them -- a means of keeping prices high -- when the government decided that one supplier was enough.
Defense officials previously purchased the weapons from both companies.
Executives of the companies couldn't be reached to comment last night.
At a Pentagon news conference scheduled for today, Clinton administration officials are expected to emphasize how closely Defense and Justice officials worked to solve a Pentagon procurement problem concerning antitrust issues.
There has been concern, expressed by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), chairman of the Senate's antitrust subcommittee, and others, that Pentagon officials may favor a more lenient antitrust attitude toward defense suppliers during a period of Defense Department cutbacks.
The two agencies, along with the Federal Trade Commission, industry representatives and outside antitrust experts participate in a Defense Department antitrust task force that examines matters regarding the consolidating defense industry, Pentagon needs and antitrust laws.
This case, which the Army referred to the Justice Department, is a "perfect example of Justice and Defense seeing eye to eye," on antitrust issues, said one government official.
"We're not at war with each other."
