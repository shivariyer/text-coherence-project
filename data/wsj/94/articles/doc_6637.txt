Luxury auto-maker Bayerische Motoren Werke AG is likely to report 1993 earnings that are more than double the six-month net income of 255 million marks ($147.1 million), a BMW board member said.
That result would still be lower than 1992 earnings, however, which totaled 726 million marks.
Full 1993 results are due to be released in March.
Commenting on BMW's big acquisition announced earlier this week, the board member, Horst Teltschik, said BMW's 80% purchase of British auto maker Rover Group Ltd. will help BMW save research-and-development costs and strengthen its position in world markets.
Mr. Teltschik also said that, with Rover, BMW has immediate access to technology for front-wheel and four-wheel drive, leading to research and development cost savings in those specific areas.
Under a pre-existing agreement, BMW already had planned to supply a line of Rover vehicles with a diesel motor, Mr. Teltschik said.
