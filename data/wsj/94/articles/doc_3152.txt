Two brokers at Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Panama City, Panama, office have been indicted by a federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., in connection with an investigation of narcotics money-laundering.
Indicted were Frank L. Greene, a vice president, and Steven L. Mills, an account executive.
Both work for Merrill Lynch International & Co., the international arm of Merrill Lynch.
Neither the unit nor the parent firm has been named in the indictments, which were unsealed last Monday.
The defendants were among 28 people charged with conspiring to launder proceeds from the sale of narcotics.
The conspiracy allegedly involved a network of different shell companies that funneled proceeds from cocaine trafficking to offshore accounts in South America, New York and Europe.
In response to the indictments, Merrill Lynch & Co. released a statement.
"If these charges are true, we would be shocked and outraged that this could happen with our employees.
We have long had policies against money-laundering, and we do not tolerate this or any other illegal activity."
The company said it has launched its own internal inquiry, will take the appropriate actions based on that inquiry and will cooperate fully with law-enforcement officials.
Mr. Greene and Mr. Mills couldn't be reached for comment.
According to the U.S. Attorney's office in Tampa, the defendants face a possible maximum fine of $500,000, and a three-year term of supervised release.
The indictments were returned as the result of a two-year undercover investigation involving the joint efforts of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service, two county sheriff offices and the Tampa police.
