The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced plans to sell up to $1.25 billion of mortgage pass-through certificates in a public offering.
The transaction will mark the FDIC's first sale of loans as part of a transaction involving mortgage-backed securities.
The FDIC said the certificates "will evidence beneficial ownership interests in performing commercial real estate-secured loans with a book value of up to $1.25 billion."
It said the commercial mortgage loans were originated by failed depository institutions nationwide that were insured by the Bank Insurance Fund.
The certificates are expected to include an FDIC guaranty for a limited amount of credit losses and interest-rate risk, with subsequent losses borne by the holders of the securities, the FDIC said.
It said the offering will be made only by means of a prospectus.
