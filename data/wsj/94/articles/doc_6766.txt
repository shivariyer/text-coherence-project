Bon-Ton Stores Inc. said harsh winter weather contributed to a 16% decline in January sales at stores open more than one year.
The clothing retailer said total sales for the four weeks ended Jan. 29 fell 18% to $12.1 million.
Same-store sales for the full year edged down 0.5%, while total sales edged up 0.9% to $336.7 million.
Despite the bad weather, Michael Gleim, senior executive vice president, said the company remains comfortable with analysts' earnings estimates for the year.
Mr. Gleim said the company expects to earn 76 cents a share, before a 14-cent gain from a change in accounting, for the year ended Saturday.
A year earlier, BonTon Stores had net income of $7.1 million, or 64 cents a share.
