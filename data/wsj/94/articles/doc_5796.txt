AB Volvo, the Swedish automotive group, said it sold its entire stake in investment company AB Custos, resulting in a capital gain of approximately 916 million kronor ($114 million).
"The transaction is part of Volvo's concentration on its core operations and a way of reducing our debt," said Volvo Chief Executive Officer Soeren Gyll in a statement.
"We believe that broader distribution of Custos's shares will benefit Custos."
Volvo said the shares were sold to Swedish and foreign institutions.
Volvo's holding in Custos amounted to 10,548,445 Class A shares and 1,474,682 Class B shares, corresponding to 25.4% of the share capital and 29.1% of the voting rights.
The total sale price for the shares was 1.74 billion kronor, Volvo said.
