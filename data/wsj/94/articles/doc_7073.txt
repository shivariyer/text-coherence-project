President Clinton could announce this week that he has decided to lift the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam, according to a senior U.S. official.
Mr. Clinton's senior advisers in December recommended such a move, based on what they saw as Hanoi's increasing cooperation in efforts to help the U.S. resolve cases of unaccounted-for U.S. soldiers from the Vietnam War.
In a bipartisan vote last week, the Senate approved a nonbinding resolution calling for lifting the 19-year-old embargo.
A senior official said last night that while Mr. Clinton hasn't made a final decision, "things are tending in that direction."
U.S. officials acknowledge that the decison is an emotional and difficult one for Mr. Clinton, who avoided military service in the Vietnam War.
Several groups that represent families of those missing or unaccounted for from the war strongly oppose lifting the embargo at this time.
These groups believe that Vietnam shouldn't be rewarded because its leaders still are holding back information or remains of servicemen killed in Vietnam.
On the other hand, there is pressure on the White House to lift the embargo from U.S. companies that believe that they are missing out on a market of 70 million consumers in a country that has experienced rapid economic growth over the past few years.
Nearly all other nations ignore the U.S. embargo and are carving up markets in Vietnam.
