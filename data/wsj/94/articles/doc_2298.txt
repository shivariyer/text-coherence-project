A leading auto and truck seat maker is hoping investors will give its initial public offering a smooth ride.
Lear Seating Corp., Southfield, Mich., traces its origins to a company founded in 1917 with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. as major customers.
It sells automobile and light truck seat systems, frames, covers and other products, and had $2.36 billion in sales last year.
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Lear proposes to sell 9.4 million common shares at an estimated $17 a share.
That would raise about $106 million for the company, which plans to sell 6,250,000 shares, and $53 million for a shareholder group that is selling 3,125,000 shares.
At $17 a share, the company would have a market capitalization of about $765 million, based on 45 million shares outstanding after the IPO.
Of the offering, 7.5 million shares will be offered in the U.S. and 1,875,000 internationally.
The company intends to list the shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
After the offering, a group of management investors will hold a 7.1% interest, for which they paid $3.03 a share.
The figures have been adjusted to reflect a recent split of Lear's common stock.
The seating business was part of Lear Siegler Inc., which buyout firm Forstmann Little & Co. purchased for $2.1 billion in 1987.
Forstmann sold the seating business in 1988 for about $500 million to a group including management, Kidder, Peabody & Co., and FIMA Finance Management Inc., an entity controlled by Ifint SA, an investment holding company of IFI SpA, parent of Italy's Agnelli Group.
Lehman Brothers purchased part of FIMA's interest in 1991.
The various buyouts have pushed Lear Seating's longterm debt to $498 million at the end of 1993, when interest expense was $45.7 million.
Calling itself the largest independent supplier of seat systems in North America, Lear says it has developed a sophisticated "just-in-time" system that enables it to deliver products to a customer's factory on as little as 90 minutes notice.
Customers include 16 original-equipment car makers including GM, which accounts for 45% of its sales, and Ford, 28%.
Lear's sales have surged in the last decade from about $160 million in the fiscal year ended mid-1983 to about $1.8 billion for the year ended last June 30.
Continuing to expand, Lear in November bought part of Ford's North American seat cover and product business for $173.4 million in cash and $10.5 million in notes.
The Ford business had sales of $515 million for the first nine months of 1993.
The selling shareholder, Ifint SA, will reduce its stake to 13% from 24%.
Partnerships affiliated with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which first invested in Lear in 1991, will have about a 58% interest in the company after the offering.
Lehman Brothers, the lead underwriter, has an option for an additional 937,500 shares to cover over-allotments.
Lear Seating lost money in three of the last four fiscal years, including $22.2 million in fiscal 1992; it earned $10.1 million for the year ended last June 30, but lost $13.8 million for calendar 1993, in part due to accounting changes.
The filing attributes the recent losses to heavy interest costs on debt incurred in the buyout.
However, the filing adds, on a pro forma basis taking into account the common stock offering, certain refinancing steps, repayment of notes and other adjustments, as well as the Ford purchase, the business in calendar 1993 would have had net income of $35.1 million.
The prospectus cautions that the auto/truck business can be volatile, particularly for independent suppliers, and analysts agree.
"There is nothing proprietary about making seats," says Albert A. Sturdivant of Sturdivant & Co.
And large customers obiously have the last word on pricing.
"It's not a good business anytime you have to deal with big guys.
They ram prices down your throat."
