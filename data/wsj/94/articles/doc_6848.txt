PHH Corp. expects slower earnings growth in the second half of its fiscal year ending April 30 than occurred in the first half, but net income for the year will rise to about $3.65 to $3.70 a share, said Roy A. Meierhenry, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
In fiscal 1993, the vehicle leasing, mortgage banking and relocation services company earned $56.4 million, or $3.25 a share, on revenue of $2.02 billion.
Because of a surge in mortgage refinancings, per-share profit for the six months ended Oct. 31 jumped to $1.74 from $1.47 a year earlier.
The Hunt Valley, Md., company's mortgage banking business will produce most of the earnings gain for fiscal 1994, Mr. Meierhenry said in an interview.
Vehicle leasing will also have higher earnings, he said, but earnings from relocation services will be "flat to down."
