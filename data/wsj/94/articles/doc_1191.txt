Mesa Airlines refused to sweeten its $32 million bid for Ccair, despite a suggestion by Ccair's directors that Mesa raise the acquisition price to about $37.4 million.
Mesa Airlines, a regional carrier based in Farmington, N.M., had originally offered to acquire Ccair by exchanging about 1.5 million Mesa shares for the approximately seven million Ccair shares outstanding, valuing those shares at about $4.50 a share.
Charlotte, N.C.-based Ccair, a commuter carrier that provides USAir Express service, rejected that offer and submitted a counterproposal valued at about $37.4 million.
Mesa said that its chairman informed Ccair's president in writing that Mesa rejected Ccair's counterproposal and was renewing the original offer until Friday .
On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, Mesa closed at $22, unchanged.
In overthe-counter trading, Ccair closed at $4.25, down 75 cents, or 15%.
