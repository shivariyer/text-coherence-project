Imperial Oil Ltd. said it plans to quit the fertilizer manufacturing business by selling most of its fertilizer assets to Sherritt Inc. in a transaction that would more than double Sherritt's annual revenue from chemicals and fertilizers.
Imperial, a Toronto petroleum and chemicals company 69.6%-owned by Exxon Corp., said it plans to sell a profitable Alberta fertilizer plant and Canadian Prairies distribution terminals to Sherritt, a Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, resources and advanced materials manufacturing company.
Imperial said it expects the transaction to close, at the earliest, by the end of February.
The companies didn't disclose the proposed transaction's value.
Sherritt said Imperial's fertilizer operations have generated annual revenue of about 250 million Canadian dollars (US$189 million) over the past five years.
It said its own existing fertilizer and chemicals operations have generated average annual revenue of about C$150 million ($113.4 million) over that period.
