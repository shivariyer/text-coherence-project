Homestake Mining Co. reported net income for the fourth quarter of $12.9 million, or nine cents a share, compared with a loss of $27.4 million, or 20 cents a share, for the year earlier.
The San Francisco company cited significantly lower costs of production, lower exploration expenses, higher gold production and higher gold sales.
But falling oil prices and lackluster sulfur prices caused the company to write down about $12.8 million of its interest in the once-ballyhooed Main Pass 299 sulfur project.
Revenue rose 18% to $184.7 million from $156 million.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Homestake stock fell 37.5 cents, or 1.7%, to close at $21.625 a share.
