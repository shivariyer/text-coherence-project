Western German industrial output was unchanged in January from December following a 0.5% upward revision in the December data, the Economics Ministry said in a preliminary report.
January's output was up 0.2% from a year earlier.
The figures are price and seasonally adjusted.
The industrial output index for December was revised upward to 111.8 from a preliminary figure of 111.2.
The revision means that December's output rose by 1.3% from November rather than the rise of 0.7% originally reported.
The stabilization in industrial production was largely because of an 8.4% increase in January output from the construction industry.
