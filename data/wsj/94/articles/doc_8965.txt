Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its long-term debt ratings for the operating units of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., citing sluggish sales growth and intensifying competition.
About $5.6 billion of debt is affected.
Public Service Electric & Gas Co., the Newark, N.J., utility holding company's primary operating unit, had its senior secured debt rating dropped to single-A-minus from single-A.
S&P said despite ample generating reserves and only limited financing pressures during the next several years, PSE&G's financial improvement likely will be limited by the weak local economy and a high dividend payout.
"We are disappointed with S&P's decision to downgrade," a spokesman for PSE&G said.
"We agree that the industry is being challenged by competition, but we feel that the company has, is and will continue to take measures to compete successfully in this business."
The company added that it has no plans to reduce its dividend.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Public Service Enterprise Group fell 37.5 cents to $30.50.
