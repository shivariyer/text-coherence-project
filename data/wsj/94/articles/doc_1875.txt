Reading & Bates Corp. said it signed a letter of intent with Deep Tech International for a joint venture to provide floating production systems for the oil and natural-gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico.
Reading & Bates, an offshore drilling-services company based in Houston, said the venture will acquire and operate semisubmersible drilling vessels that it will convert for use as floating production systems.
It said DeepTech, a closely held Houston energy company, will immediately contribute one of the vessels to the venture, and Reading & Bates will later contribute an equivalent vessel.
Reading & Bates said each company will have a 50% interest in the venture.
Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed, but a spokesman for Reading & Bates said offshore vessels are valued at between $12 and $45 million each.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Reading & Bates shares closed at $6.375, up 25 cents, or 4.1%.
