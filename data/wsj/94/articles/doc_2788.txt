Genentech Inc. said that it received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to market its Nutropin brand of human growth hormone for children who are short because they lack enough of the natural hormone.
Previously, the biotechnology concern received FDA approval for the treatment in children who don't grow because of kidney problems.
