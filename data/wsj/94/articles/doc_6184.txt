Orange & Rockland Utilities Inc. filed suit against James F. Smith, its former chairman and chief executive officer, in state supreme court in Rockland County, N.Y., claiming he misappropriated funds and failed to properly supervise corporate affairs.
Based in Pearl River, N.Y., the utility, which dismissed Mr. Smith on Oct. 7 for cause, is seeking at least $5 million in damages from the civil action.
Mr. Smith, in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Smith's dismissal stemmed from questionable financial and political dealings at the utility.
State regulators, with the cooperation of the utility, are continuing a probe.
