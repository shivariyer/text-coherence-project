Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on about $4.4 billion of debt and preferred stock of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., Syracuse, N.Y., reflecting "prospects for insufficient financial improvement."
S&P lowered ratings on senior secured debt to triple-B-minus from triple-B and senior unsecured debt and preferred stock to double-B-plus from triple-B-minus.
Commercial paper declined to single-A-3 from single-A-2.
S&P said that despite steps to control expenses and limit exposure to obligations to buy power from nonutility third parties, "material financial improvement is expected to be constrained by weak sales growth prospects, increasing fixed charges tied to nonutility generators and modest revenue losses tied to discounted rates for certain larger customers."
The report said Niagara Mohawk will be challenged to sustain the strong 1993 performance of the Nine Mile Point nuclear facility, to negotiate contracts with retail customers who can buy power elsewhere and to contain costs and minimize future rate-relief needs.
An oversupply of nonutility power will continue to put pressure on electric rates and result in excess capacity, S&P said.
Commenting on the S&P downgrade, a Niagara Mohawk spokeswoman conceded that the industry's business risks are increasing, but stressed that the company has started making progress in its cost-cutting measures.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Niagara Mohawk shares fell 12.5 cents to $18.625.
