William J. Young was named president and chief executive officer of this laser-making company, succeeding William C. Patridge, who remains chairman.
Mr. Young, 51 years old, was most recently president of Volkswagen of America Inc., a unit of Volkswagen AG, based in Wolfsburg, Germany.
He said he retired from that position last April.
Mr. Patridge, 55, said Applied Laser plans to acquire as many as eight early-stage, technical companies in the next 12 months.
