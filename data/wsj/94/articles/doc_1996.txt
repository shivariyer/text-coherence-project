I think your Feb. 16 article on the end of the supermarket war ("All Quiet on the Supermarket War Front") is a bit premature, at least in Dallas.
Since the first of the year, Tom Thumb and Kroger have been running intermittent promotions where the stores doubled coupons up to 99 cents.
Also, new grocery stores are being built all over the city.
I usually save 20% a week with coupons, and some weeks as much as one-third.
If the grocery prices get out of line, I can always shop at Sam's.
