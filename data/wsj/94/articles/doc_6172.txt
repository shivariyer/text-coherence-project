The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., caught in the spotlight of congressional criticism, adopted "interim" rules to prevent insider windfalls when state-chartered mutual savings banks convert to stockholder-owned institutions.
Under the rules, the banks must submit proposed conversions to the agency for its approval.
The FDIC said it is concerned that officers, directors and other insiders at converting institutions may be "unjustly enriched" at the expense of depositors, other customers and the FDIC's own deposit-insurance fund.
The insiders, for example, may get more than their fair share of the stock offering or get excessive compensation packages, the agency said.
On Jan. 24 the agency proposed guidelines for conversions of state-chartered mutual savings banks but didn't have any firm requirements.
Conversions of these institutions was subject only to varying state regulations.
Savings and loan associations and federally chartered savings banks converting to stockholder ownership were subject to limits on insider compensation imposed by the Office of Thrift Supervision.
The FDIC said the OTS standard is one factor it will consider in ruling on conversions of state-chartered savings banks.
It said it will take comments for 30 days, and will decide on a final approach in "a few months."
Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), the House Banking Committee chairman, praised the FDIC action, but said legislation may still be necessary to close the loophole letting officials of state-chartered savings banks "make big bucks through fancy footwork."
