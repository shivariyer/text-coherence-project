Alcan Aluminium Ltd. said it hired CS First Boston Inc. to help "review options" for its 73% stake in Alcan Australia Ltd.
The Montreal aluminum maker said it isn't considering a buyout of minority shareholders in the unit, which is publicly traded in Australia.
"Involvement in the Australian domestic aluminum market isn't a strategic priority," Alcan Aluminium said.
Alcan Australia reported net income of 772,000 Australian dollars (US$545,000) on A$636.5 million in sales for 1993.
It had 2,523 employees as of Dec. 31.
Its one aluminum smelter has 150,000 metric tons of annual capacity, or about 9% of Alcan's global capacity.
The disclosure came a day after Alcan Aluminium announced it may sell its North American building-products divisions.
CS First Boston Inc. is a unit of CS Holding.
