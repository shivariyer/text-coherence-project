Hyundai Motor Co. said it scrapped plans to build a new version of the Elantra at a facility in Bromont, Quebec, the auto maker's only assembly plant outside Korea.
Hyundai shut the Quebec plant in September to prepare for a new version of the Elantra sedan for the 1996 model year.
The company had planned to start recalling laid off workers this spring to produce the cars for the Canadian, U.S. and European markets.
John Wright, senior vice president of Hyundai's Canadian unit, said a number of factors made Hyundai decide to build the new Elantra in Korea, where costs will be lower.
The weak Canadian dollar has driven up the cost of parts, since they are purchased from the U.S. and Korea in U.S. dollars, and provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement have increased the duty on imported parts for foreign auto makers in Canada, he said.
Mr. Wright said he hopes Hyundai will find some other use for the Bromont plant, which will remain idle in the meantime.
