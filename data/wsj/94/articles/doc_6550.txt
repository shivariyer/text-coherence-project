ITT Corp. reported healthy fourth-quarter earnings against a year-earlier loss, and said it has pumped $800 million into its ITT Sheraton hotel unit, which is pursuing casino properties that could involve as much as $1 billion in investments.
For the quarter, the company reported net income of $219 million, or $1.77 a share, compared with a loss of $617 million, or $5.33 a share, a year earlier, as operating profit rose throughout most business segments.
Sales declined 2% to $5.98 billion from $6.10 billion in 1992.
ITT said the Los Angeles earthquake created more problems than originally expected for its ITT Hartford property and casualty operations.
Chairman Rand V. Araskog said the company expects about $28 million in pretax losses in the first quarter from the quake, and an additional $18 million in pretax losses from the recently brutal winter weather.
"At first we thought it was not so bad," Mr. Araskog said.
The 1993 fourth quarter included tax-related charges of $26 million, or 21 cents a share; a charge of $19 million, or 16 cents a share, for accelerated write-downs at its ITT Sheraton hotels unit; a gain of $7 million, or six cents a share, from its sale of a stake in Bally's Las Vegas operations; and a gain of $10 million, or eight cents a share, on the sale of a components distribution company.
The 1992 fourth quarter included nearly $800 million in pretax restructuring charges.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, ITT gained $1.50 to $100.875, a 52-week high.
An ITT official said the company in the fourth quarter converted about $800 million of ITT Sheraton debt to equity, and Chairman Rand V. Araskog said the unit expects to make "significant" announcements soon in its gambling operations.
"It's obvious that they have plans for Sheraton," said Jack Modzelewski, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
He and some other analysts think one possibility might be to spin off part of Sheraton to be public.
