Regal Cinemas Inc. said it reached a definitive agreement to acquire a South Carolina-based chain of theaters for about $60 million in stock, plus the assumption of about $19 million in debt.
The chain, closely held Litchfield Theatres Ltd. in Pawleys Island, S.C., has 24 theaters with 172 screens in six states, primarily in the Southeast.
Revenue in 1993, according to Regal, totaled more than $40 million.
Knoxville, Tenn.-based Regal, which operates 48 multi-screen theaters in 10 states, said it will issue 2.5 million shares of stock to Litchfield.
In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Regal closed at $24 a share, down 25 cents.
Regal said it expects to close the transaction, which will be accounted for as a pooling of interests, in June or July.
