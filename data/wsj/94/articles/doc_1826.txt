The subsidiaries, Casino World Inc. and Mississippi Gaming Corp., will build the complex in partnership with Trump Diamondhead Inc. on a 404.5-acre waterfront site in Diamondhead.
The project is contingent on receipt of site approvals and project financing, as well as receipt of a gaming license from the Mississippi Gaming Commission.
