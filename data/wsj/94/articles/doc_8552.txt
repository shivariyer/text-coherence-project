CBS Inc., as expected, won the U.S. television rights to the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, for $375 million.
The rights fee, a Winter Olympics record, is 27% more than the $295 million that CBS paid for the games this year in Lillehammer, Norway.
At a New York news conference, CBS Chairman Laurence Tisch said the price, reached in negotiation with the International Olympics Committee, "is a number we're very happy with."
He said CBS will "just about" break even.
Although there were no other bidders for the games, Mr. Tisch dismissed suggestions that CBS had overpaid.
"We're big boys," he said.
"We know when to fold our cards and leave the game."
General Electric Co.'s NBC and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. didn't bid because CBS was willing to pay more.
News Corp.'s Fox didn't bid, either, after deciding to "concentrate on the properties they had," said Richard Pound, chairman of the IOC's television negotiating committee.
Fox, which told Mr. Pound it is interested in the year 2000 summer games in Sydney, Australia, just acquired its first sports franchise, National Football League games previously held by CBS.
