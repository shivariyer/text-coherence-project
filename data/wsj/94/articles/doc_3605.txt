Salomon Brothers was appointed by the U.K. Treasury to help advise on the disposal of billions of pounds of debt issued by British Telecommunications PLC and a number of British utility concerns.
It was the first major award to the Salomon Inc. unit since it was bounced from a BT privatization effort in the wake of the 1991 Treasury bill scandal.
The debt, with a face value of #2.8 billion ($4.16 billion), is that issued by BT and a number of electricity companies at the time of their privatization some years ago.
But most of the paper has a coupon yield of about 12%, reflecting the level of interest rates in Britain at the time of issue.
Because rates have fallen sharply, the paper's market value is significantly higher than face value.
Salomon officials said they could make no comment on their likely recommendations for the debt.
But one option is likely to be an auction open to both the issuing companies and institutional investors.
In a similar sale of #1.3 million of privatized companies' debt in November 1992, around half of the paper was taken up by the issuing companies as a way of reducing their outstanding borrowings.
