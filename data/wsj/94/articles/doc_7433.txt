Porsche AG said shareholders approved a capital increase, that based on its recent share price could raise about 268.8 million marks ($155.3 million) for the German car maker.
At a general shareholders meeting, Porsche Chairman Wendelin Wiedeking also reported that group sales for the fiscal first half that began Aug. 1 were up 10% to about 920 million marks.
But the chairman said the 10% increase will "by no means" be matched by an increase in profit.
Porsche, based in Stuttgart, reported this month that the six-month loss was 115 million marks, narrower than the yearearlier period's 120 million mark loss.
Mr. Wiedeking repeated the prognosis for a 140 million-mark to 150 million-mark loss in the current year on sales of over two billion marks.
He said the company should return to profit next year.
