Poseidon Gold Ltd., an Australian gold mining company, said it has boosted its takeover offer for Aztec Mining Co. 8.8% to 74 Australian cents (53 U.S.cents) a share, from an earlier offer of 68 cents a share.
The new bid values Aztec at around 287.0 million Australian dollars (US$205 million) and will expire March 18.
Poseidon Gold launched its bid for Aztec Dec. 15, 1993, but was confronted with a rival bid by Pancontinental Mining Ltd., which emerged in February with a share and options offer that immediately won approval from Aztec directors.
Poseidon Gold, 60%-owned by Normandy Poseidon Ltd., said in a statement it also decided to remove all conditions previously attached to the offer, such as only paying for shares it receives if it controls at least 50.1% of Aztec's issued capital.
The company said it currently holds 261,688 shares in Aztec, equal to 0.06% of Aztec's issued shares.
