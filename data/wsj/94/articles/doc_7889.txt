GENEVA STEEL said in Vineyard, Utah, that it has amended its previously filed registration statement covering a public offering of senior notes due in 2004.
The integrated steel maker said the amendment increases the size of the offering to $190 million from $125 million.
Geneva expects to use proceeds to refinance the company's privately placed senior and subordinated term debt and for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.
