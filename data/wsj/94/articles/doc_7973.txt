A unit of New England Electric System announced the cancellation of a proposed 72,500 kilowatt coal-fired power plant in East Providence, R.I., that would have sold its output to the company and 11 Massachusetts municipalities.
The unit, New England Power, attributed the action to the region's economic downturn and less costly generation alternatives.
Spokesman David Saad said the cancellation will cost the company $21 million, but that it eventually will recover at least $9 million of that.
He said the company does not plan to take a charge or pass on the cost to ratepayers.
If approved by state and federal agencies, New England Power and two of the municipalities will make cash payments to Newbay's owner, Rhode Island Cogeneration Associates.
In addition, New England Power will sell surplus power to the other nine municipalities, allowing it to recover some of its costs.
New England Power is a wholesale generation and transmission unit of New England Electric System, a utility holding company based in Westborough, Mass.
