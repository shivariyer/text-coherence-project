Figgie International Inc., facing a liquidity crunch, put its Rawlings Sporting Goods division on the block.
Figgie said it retained Dillon, Read & Co. to manage the sale of all or part of Rawlings, which makes baseballs, basketballs, equipment and uniforms, including those used by professional sports teams.
The company is trying to focus on industrial and technical manufacturing.
On Jan. 9, Figgie said it incurred a "significant" loss for the fourth quarter and year and was seeking to sell some noncore assets to pay down debt.
It hasn't yet reported fourth-quarter results.
Meanwhile, acknowledging a "cashflow squeeze," Figgie is renegotiating its credit lines with its bank syndicate after exhausting its $150 million line of credit.
While Figgie doesn't release financial results of its individual units, analysts put Rawlings's annual revenue at about $125 million.
The St. Louis-based division, with 1,300 employees, is the largest piece of Figgie's consumer-products group, which had an operating profit of $29 million on sales of $223 million in 1992.
"It's a good choice to drop," said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
"It hasn't been that great on the bottom line, yet the name and the franchise are good enough that somebody will be willing to pay a good price for it."
Figgie Chairman Harry Figgie is the author of the best-selling book "Bankruptcy 1995," a grim warning about the U.S.'s mounting deficit.
Figgie's debt has been growing steeply as well.
As of Sept. 30, Figgie had about $450 million of debt.
Mr. Figgie says he wants to reduce debt to $200 million in 1994.
In 1992, Figgie had net income of $28.3 million on sales of $1.2 billion, from its mix of consumer, technical, industrial and service businesses, ranging from firefighting equipment to private security operations.
