Orange & Rockland Utilities Inc. dismissed L. Mario DiValentino and Thomas A. Folchi, two officers who at one time had financial oversight at the company.
Orange and Rockland declined to specify what prompted the dismissals, although a spokesman said a special board committee investigation has given the financial area "rigorous scrutiny."
Mr. Folchi, 49 years old, vice president, customer service and human resources, couldn't be reached for comment.
Messages left at the home of Mr. DiValentino, 44, vice president, accounting and finance, weren't returned.
The company has been conducting an internal investigation into misuse of company funds.
James Smith, the company's former chairman and chief executive officer, was dismissed in October 1993.
In February the utility filed suit in New York State Supreme Court in Rockland County against Mr. Smith seeking $5 million in damages.
The suit charges that Mr. Smith failed in his fiduciary duty and converted company funds to his personal use.
He remains a director, however, at least until the next annual meeting.
A former Orange & Rockland vice president for corporate policy and external affairs in October pleaded guilty in Rockland County district court to charges of grand larceny and bribery.
And two other former employees had pleaded guilty to stealing $199,000 from the company through a phony billing scheme.
