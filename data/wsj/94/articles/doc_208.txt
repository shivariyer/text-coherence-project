Montgomery Ward & Co., Chicago, completed its announced purchase of closely held appliance and consumer-electronics retailer Lechmere Corp. in a transaction valued at $100 million.
Montgomery Ward also said it assumed $106 million of Lechmere debt and might pay as much as $20 million and 400,000 common shares depending on the new unit's performance.
An independent accounting firm valued Montgomery Ward's shares at $22.50 each at the end of 1992; using that price, the stock it may issue for Lechmere would be valued at $9 million.
Lechmere, based in Woburn, Mass., had 1993 sales of more than $800 million.
It operates 24 stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York.
Montgomery Ward had 1993 sales of more than $6 billion.
While Montgomery Ward hadn't previously disclosed terms, a source close to the company earlier estimated it might pay about $750 million, including assumption of debt, to effect the acquisition.
