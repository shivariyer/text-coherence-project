Japan's household spending in December was 438,233 yen ($4,186) on average, up 0.4% from the same month a year earlier in real terms, the Statistics Bureau of the Prime Minister's Office reported.
The rise stretched the streak of year-on-year expansion in household spending to three months, given increases of 1.4% in November and 0.4% in October, the first year-on-year rise in six months.
