Telesat Canada said it expects to restore to commercial service a communications satellite that it says was knocked out of commision two weeks ago by a powerful geomagnetic storm.
Telesat officials said they intend to keep the Anik E2 satellite pointing toward Earth by firing the spacecraft's thruster rockets every few minutes for the remainder of the satellite's operating life.
The procedure will reduce the satellite's life by as much as two years, Telesat officials estimated.
The E2, which was launched in 1991, was expected to last for another 10 years.
The plan requires Telesat to build a ground network of sensors to measure the satellite's tilt from the equator.
The system is expected to cost about 3 million Canadian dollars (US$2.3 million), said Larry Boisvert, Telesat president.
"We are 100% technically confident that we can make this system work to bring Anik E2 into full commercial service this summer," he said.
Telesat is controlled by Canada's major telephone companies.
