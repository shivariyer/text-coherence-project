I was impressed by your article on Edmund Pankau in the Jan. 12 edition ("Pankau, P.I.: Less Than Meets the Eye?").
My close friend and confidant Tom Sherman Sr., owner of the Lake Charles American Press and other newspapers, once shared with me his thoughts on the state of investigative reporting.
He said, in summary, that it was a lost art.
The time was during the 1960s.
For me, the article on Mr. Pankau clearly establishes that you both know and practice the art.
I commend you for it.
Tom would too, if he were still alive.
