I am extremely disturbed and angry because of your mudslinging article about my father (Haim Dabah of Gitano Group Inc., page one, Feb. 18).
This was pure tabloid journalism.
I'll prove it, telling you only what I know firsthand, which is that in relation to my bar mitzvah.
One: The way your reporter ties in this lie about my bar mitzvah (that's what it is, a lie, nothing but mudslinging, since it is of little or no relevance to the fall of Gitano) is by having the bar mitzvah happen "just a few months before customs agents come calling" (in December 1991).
The bar mitzvah was in March 1990, closer to two years than to "a few months."
Two: There were 450 people, not 1,000 at my bar mitzvah.
Three: What group of dancers was flown in by the family from Brazil?
The dancers were all New Yorkers.
Four: It wasn't Lester Lanin's orchestra, it was Steven Scott's.
Five (And this one upsets me the most): The reporter wrote "the flourish that brought gasps was a glass-enclosed wind tunnel filled with one-dollar bills: Each child at the party was escorted into the chamber to grab as many fistsful of dollars as he or she could."
This is another outright lie, told just to create a false image of my father.
There was no real money involved.
This was a common game played the same at any other party just as well as mine, using Monopoly-type money.
I have kept one as a memento and have enclosed it.
Also, you made it sound like this was a main attraction, but the game was one of several in a children's game room, which most adults didn't even see.
I still don't know why you even wrote about my bar mitzvah, which was a special moment in my life.
But at least you should have verified the facts and written the truth.
