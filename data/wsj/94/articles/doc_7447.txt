Hillhaven Corp., a Tacoma, Wash.-based nursing-home operator, said its largest shareholder, National Medical Enterprises Inc. increased its holdings of Hillhaven shares to 25% on a fully diluted basis.
National Medical, which spun off Hillhaven in 1990 while retaining 14% of the concern, exercized warrants to purchase six million shares of Hillhaven's stock.
A Hillhaven spokesman described National Medical, Santa Monica, Calif., as a "passive, long-term" investor.
