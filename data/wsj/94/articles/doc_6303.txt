CPC International Inc. said fourth-quarter net income rose 77%, affected by a one-time charge a year earlier.
The food company said quarterly earnings rose to $125.1 million, or 82 cents a share, from $70.8 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier.
The year-earlier period included a charge of $46.8 million, or 31 cents a share, from discontinued operations.
Without the charge, the company said profit was up 6.4%.
Fourth-quarter sales dropped 2.4% to $1.75 billion, from $1.79 billion.
The company said sales were affected by lower values of European exchange rates despite "good volume improvement."
For the year, earnings more than doubled to $454.5 million, or $2.95 a share, from $223.8 million, or $1.41 a share, in 1992.
The earlier year included $206.8 million, or $1.37 a share, in one-time charges for discontinued operations and accounting adjustments.
Without the charges, the company said profit increased 5.6%.
Sales rose 2.1% to $6.7 billion, from $6.6 billion.
"It's reasonable to expect that CPC's earnings growth rates can move toward and into the double digits as the year progresses," assuming European currencies won't weaken compared with last year, said C.R. Shoemate, CPC's chairman and chief executive officer.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading, CPC was down $1.875 at $47.50.
