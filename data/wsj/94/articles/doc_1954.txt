Aluminum Co. of America said it will take a first-quarter charge of $50 million, or 56 cents a share, to shut an aluminum fabricating plant in Vernon, Calif., near Los Angeles.
The company said it took the action after the 700 workers at the plant rejected concessions the company had sought after less than one year had elapsed on the union's three-year contract.
Alcoa said the proposed cutbacks were necessary to offset losses caused by declining business and competition from companies with lower operating costs.
Alcoa, along with the rest of the industry, has suffered as prices have plummeted amid a world-wide aluminum oversupply.
For the fourth quarter of 1993, Alcoa reported a wider-than-expected loss of $86.9 million, or $16.9 million before a charge.
In February, the company said it was cutting about 8% of its domestic smelting capacity at its operations in Rockdale, Texas, and Wenatchee, Wash.
United Auto Workers Union Local 808, which represents the workers at the California plant, didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
The plant, built in 1938, produces aluminum forgings and extrusions primarily for the aerospace industry.
The union's labor agreement expires in June 1996.
The workers earned an average of about $14 an hour in wages, plus benefits, for a package totaling about $23.13 an hour, an Alcoa spokesman said.
Alcoa has 63,400 employees in the U.S. and 160 plants world-wide.
Estimates for Alcoa's results in the current quarter vary widely, ranging from a loss of three cents to a profit of 13 cents a share (excluding the anticipated charge), based on nine analysts' estimates compiled by First Call, a unit of Thomson Financial Services in Boston.
In the first quarter of 1993, Alcoa reported net income of $27.6 million, or 31 cents a share.
Alcoa closed at $73.625, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
