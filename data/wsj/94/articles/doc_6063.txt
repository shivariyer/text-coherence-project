British Telecommunications PLC took another swipe at Mercury Communications Ltd., cutting telephone charges by abolishing higher rates for periods of peak demand in a move that is seen putting further pressure on the Cable & Wireless PLC unit.
The change is seen biting into Mercury's business-market base, which analysts say provides almost all its profit, and defending BT's residential market share.
At the same time, MFS Communications Co. of the U.S. announced plans to enter the lucrative London heavy-use telephone market in April, increasing competition in Mercury's core market.
Mercury, which is 80% owned by Cable & Wireless and 20% owned by Canada's BCE Inc., immediately fought BT's move, scrapping its own prime-period price premium, rather than lose its average 20% discount to BT prices.
Mercury concedes the discounting will squeeze its profit margins, "but by no more than we thought," a spokeswoman said.
BT's price cuts were widely expected.
Some analysts say the cuts do nothing more than complete the 500 million of cuts required this year by the government's Office of Telecommunications.
