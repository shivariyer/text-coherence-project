Texas Instruments Inc. said it expects the world-wide semiconductor market to grow 17% this year, well below last year's 29% jump fed by the boom in personal computers.
The electronics company, in a briefing to financial analysts, characterized the new projection as a sign of a "stable" chip market, which for most of the past two decades has grown at an average rate of about 14% to 15% a year.
"It's just a natural slowdown," said Vladi Catto, the company's chief economist.
"Growth rates of 30% are just not sustainable."
Analysts said they weren't overly worried by Mr. Catto's lower projection, considering the current signs of health in the chip market and TI's penchant for conservative forecasting.
"We really do have a strong market and a strong economy," said Mona E. Eraiba, a semicondcutor analyst at Gruntal & Co. in New York.
"If TI says it's 17% that probably means it's going to be 22%."
Indeed, even Mr. Catto acknowledges that TI vastly underestimated the strength of last year's PC industry.
As a result of those lower estimates, TI predicted the world-wide chip business would grow by 17%, to $70 billion, in 1993.
Actually, the market grew by 29%, to $77.2 billion.
