Libbey Inc. said it expects to post an operating profit of as much as $54 million for 1993, up from a 1992 pro forma operating profit of $47.1 million.
Officials of the Toledo, Ohio, maker of glass tableware, said they're comfortable with analysts' estimates for 1993 per-share earnings between $1.53 to $1.55, compared with $1.27 a year earlier.
Libbey, which became a publicly traded company in June, plans to release its fourth-quarter results next week.
"We are cautiously optimistic about 1994 and what it offers for us," said John F. Meier, Libbey's chairman and chief executive officer.
