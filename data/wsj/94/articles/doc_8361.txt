Healthdyne Technologies Inc. expects to report that fourth-quarter earnings jumped about 50% from a year earlier on a sales increase of more than 30%, said Craig Reynolds, president and chief executive.
The maker of medical devices for home and specialized clinical settings anticipates that fourth-quarter net income will total just above $1.5 million, compared with $1 million a year earlier.
Mr. Reynolds said per-share earnings will likely exceed analysts' estimates of 16 cents, ending up in the "range of 16 cents to 18 cents."
Revenue, he said, totaled about $20 million in the quarter compared with $15.2 million in the 1992 fourth quarter.
For all of 1993, Healthdyne Technologies expects to report net income of just above $5 million, compared with $3.8 million a year earlier.
Again, Mr. Reynolds said he expects per-share earnings to slightly exceed analysts' estimates of 60 cents, coming in at 60 cents to 62 cents.
Revenue in 1993 totaled about $68 million, Mr. Reynolds said, compared with $54.3 million in 1992.
The expected gains for the quarter and the year come on a larger number of average shares outstanding: about 9.3 million in the just-completed quarter compared with 7.5 million a year earlier, and about 8.4 million for all of 1993 compared with 7.5 million in 1992.
In an interview, Mr. Reynolds said he is "very comfortable" with estimates that Healthdyne Technologies will report earnings of 70 cents to 72 cents a share for all of 1994.
He said he anticipates growth in both revenue and profit of between 20% and 25% for the year.
Reviewing the company's performance for the fourth quarter and year, Mr. Reynolds noted that Healthdyne Technologies had record performances in each of its three primary segments: diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, respiratory care, and infant monitoring.
In sleep disorders, the fastest-growing and most profitable of the three segments, revenue jumped 40% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, Mr. Reynolds said.
