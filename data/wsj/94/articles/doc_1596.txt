The National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. said the Securities and Exchange Commission affirmed the NASD's disciplinary action against G.K. Scott & Co. and two employees of the brokerage firm.
In June 1992, the NASD imposed three separate fines totaling $770,000 on G.K. Scott and the two employees, charging the firm with overcharging customers in an initial public offering it controlled.
The SEC affirmed the NASD sanctions following an appeal of the decision by an NASD committee.
The firm, based in Plainview, N.Y., was fined $716,000 jointly and severally with John Kevorkian, the firm's trader; and $50,000 jointly and severally with George Kevorkian, the firm's president.
NASD also fined G.K. Scott $4,000 and suspended it from acting as a lead underwriter in any underwriting for six months.
An attorney for G.K. Scott and the Kevorkians said the parties have appealed the action to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
