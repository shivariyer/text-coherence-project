Heterosexual contact continues to account for an increasing proportion of all new AIDS cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
While heterosexual contact accounted for less than 9% of the 103,500 reported AIDS cases in 1993, that percentage has jumped from 1.9% in 1985.
During the same period, the proportion of cases attributed to male-to-male sexual contact decreased to 46.6% from 66.5%, the CDC said.
The 1993 figures incorporate a change in AIDS-reporting criteria that broadens the definition of the disease to include various conditions among those infected with the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus.
The reporting change increased the official number of AIDS cases in the U.S., which totaled 49,016 in 1992.
It was unclear exactly how many AIDS cases would have been reported in 1993 under pre-1993 criteria.
The number of AIDS cases attributed to heterosexual contact increased 130% in 1993 to 9,288 from 4,045 in 1992.
Cases in all other exposure categories increased a combined 109%.
In 1993, nearly half the heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases were acquired through contact with a partner whose HIV infection was unreported or unknown.
Another 42.3% of those cases were attributed to heterosexual contact with an injected-drug user.
