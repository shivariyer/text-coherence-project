Cominco Ltd. said it will build a lead smelter at its Trail, British Columbia, operations for 145 million Canadian dollars (US$107.2 million).
The smelter will replace a smelter shut down in 1990 that was technologically incompatible with the ore it processed.
Cominco, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, will close a separate, older lead smelter.
The new smelter, to start up in 1996, will increase the company's lead-smelting capacity to about 132,000 tons a year, up from 110,000 currently.
Cominco also said it will spend C$25 million to increase capacity at its zinc operations over the next three years to about 320,000 tons a year from 290,000.
Under an agreement with British Columbia, the province will pay Cominco C$51.8 million for the right to expand power production at two Cominco hydroelectric dams near Trail.
The mining concern also agreed to pay the province a variable amount based on profit at Trail.
A spokesman said the amount depends on metal prices in the next several years.
