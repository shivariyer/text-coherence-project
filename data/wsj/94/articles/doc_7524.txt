Several auto makers said they plan overtime this weekend at U.S. assembly plants, in part to make up production shortfalls last week.
Automotive News, a trade publication, estimates that the U.S. domestic auto makers produced 47,785 fewer cars and trucks last week than planned because of plant closures as a result of severe weather conditions.
Ford Motor Co. was the hardest hit of the auto makers, with 15 assembly plants closed because of the bad weather.
Altogether, the domestic auto makers said they plan to build 258,640 cars and trucks this week, up 38% from the 188,076 vehicles built in the same week a year earlier.
