Tribune Co. said it plans to reduce its equity stake in Quno Corp., a Canadian newsprint supplier, to 34% from 59%, through the sale of 5.5 million common shares in the company.
The Chicago-based publisher of the Chicago Tribune and other newspapers said it expects to sell the shares at 24.75 Canadian dollars (US$18) apiece, a price that would yield proceeds of about C$136 million (US$99.5 million).
The shares will be sold to a syndicate led by Wood Gundy Inc. of Toronto, which will offer the shares to the public in Canada.
The stock sale is expected to close in two to three weeks, Tribune said.
The company said it expects to record a second-quarter gain from the sale, but declined to elaborate.
In addition to newspaper activities, Tribune's interests include, book publishing, broadcasting and entertainment.
