U.K. leisure concern Ladbroke Group PLC said it sold 15 properties for #100.3 million ($146.7 million) to Burford Holdings PLC.
Ladbroke said it received a nonrefundable deposit of #5 million.
A further #78 million is to be received April 8.
The balance, in respect to two of the properties, will be received later.
The money will be used to reduce debt.
Ladbroke operates betting parlors and retail home-improvement stores under the name of Texas Homecare and owns Hilton Hotels outside the U.S.
The company said the properties sold produced rental income of #5.9 million in 1993.
The British properties include three Central London office buildings, offices in Birmingham, Glasgow and Reading, a warehouse in Brighton, a leisure property in Luton, retail units in Gloucester, and pending completion by February 1998, a retail and warehouse park in Falkirk, Scotland.
The Falkirk property represents #16 million of the sale.
The net asset value of the properties, together with the estimated completion costs of the Falkirk property, totaled #95.5 million, Ladbroke said.
Ladbroke Chief Executive Peter George said the sale is "the first significant step in our plans to sell down our commercial-property interests."
