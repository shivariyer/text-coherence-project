Swedish telecommunications group Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson said its Ericsson Communications (Thailand) Ltd. subsidiary has been selected by Thailand's Advanced Info Services Ltd. as its major supplier of "GSM" equipment.
GSM stands for global system for mobile communications.
The initial order is valued at 100 million kronor ($12.2 million), Ericsson said, adding that it includes "switching equipment, base transceiver stations and a network management system."
The communications system in Bangkok will be in operation in March, and AIS is planning to cover all major parts of Thailand by year's end, Ericsson said.
