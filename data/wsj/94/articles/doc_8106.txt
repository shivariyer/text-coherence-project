German metals, trading and engineering concern Metallgesellschaft AG said it can't yet quantify its loss for the first three months of the year that began Oct. 1.
"That it will be considerable isn't a surprise" because of transactions in the oil-futures market, a spokesman said.
The German Sunday newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported that the loss would be around that of a year earlier and could be about 400 million marks ($228.3 million).
Welt am Sonntag quoted Wieland Schneider, who runs the finance department just below the management-board level, as describing the results as "disastrous."
This Thursday, the company's supervisory board is to receive a report on first-quarter earnings and restructuring efforts from the group's new chairman, Kajo Neukirchen.
