Ifint SA, the international investment arm of Italy's Agnelli Group, said it will change its name to the Exor Group after a shareholders' meeting in March.
The Luxembourg-based portfolio-management company, which operates in New York, Paris and Hong Kong, is among a group of companies owned by Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of the auto maker Fiat SpA.
