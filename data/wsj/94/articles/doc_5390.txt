Williams Cos., Tulsa, Okla., said a unit agreed to pay Public Service Co. of New Mexico $155 million for natural-gas gathering and processing assets in New Mexico.
Williams said its Williams Field Services Group, which specializes in gathering and processing natural gas, agreed to acquire Public Service facilities and operations in New Mexico's San Juan and Permian Basins.
Williams, a pipeline, natural-gas and telecommunications company, said the Public Service assets include two natural-gas processing plants near Bloomfield, N.M.; a processing plant southeast of Bloomfield; a smaller processing plant and an amine treatment plant near Carlsbad, N.M.; and approximately 1,400 miles of associated gas-gathering systems.
A spokesman for Public Service, based in Albuquerque, N.M., said the sale is "right on line" with the utility company's plans to shed gas-gathering operations and focus on electric and gas services.
