International Musto Explorations Ltd. said it signed a letter of intent with M.I.M. Holdings Ltd. of Australia to jointly develop Musto's big copper and gold deposit in Argentina.
Under the proposed agreement, M.I.M. would pay Musto $130 million (U.S.) for a 50% stake in the Bajo de la Alumbrera project.
The deposit contains mineable reserves of 10 million ounces of gold and six billion pounds of copper, according to Musto, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia.
The pact could thwart a planned takeover bid by Metall Mining Corp. of Toronto for all the shares of Musto.
Metall said last week it plans to offer 16.25 Canadian dollars (US$12.26) for each of the 16.3 million Musto shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.
Musto director Bill Rand said the company prefers the M.I.M. pact because it attaches a higher value to the project than the planned Metall offer, which has an indicated value of C$265 million.
A Metall official said the company will make a formal offer for the Musto shares this week.
Musto said a formal pact with M.I.M. is expected late this month.
