The Environmental Protection Agency filed seven administrative complaints seeking $4.7 million in fines from companies alleged to have violated federal standards for incinerators, boilers and industrial furnaces.
Among the companies affected and fines sought are Abbott Laboratories ($991,775); Union Carbide Chemicals & Plastics Co., a subsidiary of Union Carbide Corp. ($320,300); American Cyanamid Co. ($417,600); Dow Chemical Co., ($270,730); and Reilly Industries Inc. ($1,704,350).
All of the penalties are being sought under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs disposal of solid waste.
The alleged violations, which relate mainly to monitoring requirements for waste burned or chemicals emitted from the plants, will be reviewed by administrative law judges in various jurisdictions.
Separately, the EPA and the Justice Department filed suit against Neville Chemical Co. for allegedly violating 19 requirements of the federal solid-waste law, including nine governing the burning of hazardous waste in industrial boilers, at a plant in Neville Island, Pa.
The Justice Department is seeking a fine of $475,000 per day.
