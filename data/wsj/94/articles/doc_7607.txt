American Express Co. revived its complaint that Visa U.S.
A falsely claims in its promotional material that merchants have quit accepting the American Express Card.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York by American Express Travel Related Services Co., said a newsletter distributed to restaurants and allegedly underwritten by Visa "falsely states" that chef Wolfgang Puck stopped accepting the American Express card at several restaurants in California and Nevada after conducting a test among customers.
Visa spokesman Gregory Holmes said the newsletter was inaccurate and a correction will appear in the next edition stating the American Express card is accepted at Chinois on Main, in Santa Monica, Calif., and Spago in Las Vegas.
The suit seeks to enjoin alleged false advertising and unspecified damages.
