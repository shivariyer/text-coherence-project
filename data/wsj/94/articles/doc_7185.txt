Bank of Boston Corp. said it completed the previously reported sale of the domestic portion of its factoring business to Bank of New York Co. for a pretax gain of $27 million in its first quarter.
Bank of Boston said it expects an additional small pretax gain on the sale of the Canadian portion of the business, which it expects to complete later this year after receipt of regulatory approvals.
For its 1993 first quarter the company reported net of $67.4 million, or 67 cents a share, after a $17.2 million gain related to an accounting change.
