Standard & Poor's Corp. said it was raising some credit ratings of USF&G and its insurance companies, prompted by continuing improvements in the property and casualty unit.
S&P raised the rating on the holding company's senior debt to triple-B-minus from double-B-plus.
S&P didn't say how much debt was affected by the changes.
S&P expects that a recapitalization plan contemplated by management will reduce the company's leverage significantly, enabling greater retention of earnings, capital formation and liquidity.
