Calgene Inc., the biotechnology company that plans to sell the genetically engineered Flavr Savr tomato, said that with its partner Campbell Soup Co., it settled a patent dispute with Zeneca A.V.P. over the polygalacturonase gene in tomatoes.
Under the agreement, Campbell will sell to Calgene and Zeneca the rights to commercialize use of the gene.
Calgene will have exclusive rights to produce and sell fresh tomato products.
Zeneca and Campbell will have co-exclusive rights to produce and sell processed tomato products, while Zeneca will have rights to sub-license this technology to other processors.
