The French government said it is prepared to take part in the first tranche of a capital injection for the money-losing state airline, Air France, under a recovery plan proposed by its chairman, Christian Blanc.
But the government's willingness to inject more cash in successive tranches will depend on whether the airline attains certain recovery goals.
The prime minister's office said Mr. Blanc had asked for "a very significant capital increase."
News reports have pegged the amount at 20 billion francs, ($3.43 billion), but Air France refused to confirm any amount.
The French government said that the recovery plan proposed by the chairman will cut staff and improve productivity without firing anyone, in consultation with the unions.
Employees will be offered a chance to take shares in Air France under the plan.
