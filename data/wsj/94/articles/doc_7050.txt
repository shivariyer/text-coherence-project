Contrary to the conclusion reached in the Journal's article on Jan. 19 ("Workers' Comp: Did the Reforms Help?"), the new workers' compensation law is working well for most Texas employers and workers.
For evidence you need look no further than the National Federation of Independent Business survey mentioned in the article itself.
According to that survey, 50.5% of small businesses saw their workers' compensation premiums remain the same or decline.
And of those that reported an increase, more than two-thirds saw changes of 10% or less.
This represents a dramatic improvement over two years ago, when annual increases of 50% or more were commonplace.
Even better results may be in store.
For instance, Tom Weekly, a McAllen small-business man exemplified in the article as not benefiting from the law, told me that his 1994 premiums have declined 20%.
In addition, he now says both workers and businesses are coming out ahead under the law, and terms it "a good deal all around, unless you're a lawyer."
The article also casts only partial light on the treatment of injured workers.
It suggests that they must go it alone in settling claims disputes.
Yet it fails to report that, according to the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission, 90% of workers' comp claims now are handled with no need for dispute resolution, compared with 60% before the reforms.
The fact is that, under the new law, employers of all sizes who have workers' comp coverage are beginning to realize savings.
Moreover, the injured-on-the-job employees who work for them are receiving greater benefits, more speedily and with fewer hassles than before.
That sounds like an improvement to me.
