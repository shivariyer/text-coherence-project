The Post cereals unit of Kraft General Foods, is raising prices on 16 of its 24 ready-to-eat cereals an average of 3.1%, following similar moves by two competitors.
Kellogg Co., the nation's largest cereal maker, touched off the latest increases earlier this month.
Last Friday Quaker Oats Co. joined in, with a 2.2% average increase that covered most of its brands.
Among the major cereal producers, only General Mills Inc. has said it wouldn't raise prices, contending that subsequent promotion costs to retain consumers often cancel out any gain from a higher price.
Ralston Purina Co., the nation's biggest producer of private-label cereals, had no immediate comment on whether it would raise its prices.
Post, which is part of Philip Morris Cos.' food group, most recently increased list prices on its breakfast cereals in August.
Post has about a 15% share of the $8 billion U.S. cold-cereal market, Kellogg a 37% share and Quaker a 7.8% share.
