Buoyed by sales of its vision products and multiple-sclerosis drug, Chiron Corp. posted modest profits for the 1993 fourth quarter and full year, after year-earlier losses.
In the fourth quarter, Chiron reported profit of $5.5 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with a year-ago net loss of $46.9 million, or $1.50 a share.
Revenue surged 57% to $93.3 million from $59.4 million a year earlier.
For all of 1993, the biotechnology company posted profit of $18.4 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $99.3 million, or $3.29 a share, in 1992.
Revenue rose almost 29% to $317.5 million from $246.3 million
Pacing Chiron's strong performance were the first substantial sales of its drug Betaseron for multiple sclerosis.
Chiron manufactures the drug for its marketing partner Berlex Laboratories, a unit of Germany's Schering AG.
Betaseron, approved for the U.S. market in early December, garnered Chiron $10.5 million from volume shipments to Berlex in the fourth quarter, up from $1.3 million from pilot shipments to Berlex in the third quarter.
However, Betaseron remains tightly rationed, available to about 20,000 patients or roughly a fifth of potential users, due to limited manufacturing capacity.
Chiron is racing to expand production at its plant in Emeryville, and at a new facility in Puerto Rico, in order to meet its goal of supplying as many as 40,000 patients by the end of 1994, and 100,000 or more patients by the end of 1995.
Chiron's share of profits from its joint business with Ortho Diagnostic Systems rose.
But sales of its cancer drug interleukin-2 subsided in the fourth quarter after three quarters of increasing sales.
Chiron's bursting pipeline of new products in development led to increased expenditures on clinical trials for vaccines for genital herpes, HIV and flu, as well as on development of DNA probes for viral diseases.
Capital spending in 1994 is expected to match the 1993 outlay of $115 million as plant expansions continue.
Chiron's results fell within analysts' general expectation for the company's turnaround year.
The report was released after the close of the trading day, which saw Chiron's highflying stock close up 25 cents, or 0.3%, at $73.625 a share on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
