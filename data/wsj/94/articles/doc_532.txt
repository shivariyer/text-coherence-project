Waxman Industries Inc. said it extended its purchase offer for all, but not less than $66 million, of its 13.75% senior subordinated notes a week to Friday .
Investors have tendered $87.4 million principal amount of the notes, of which about $98.8 million is outstanding.
Waxman will pay $1,065 in cash per $1,000 principal amount with interest accrued to, but not including, the payment date for the notes, which are due June 1, 1999.
The company, a supplier to the home repair and remodeling market, said the extension is to coordinate the offer with an overall debt refinancing, which it expects to complete Monday.
The overall refinancing includes $39 million of senior secured notes, $2 million of convertible subordinated debentures and $25 million of domestic bank debt.
