Equifax Inc., Atlanta, expects to report earnings per share in the fourth quarter jumped more than 18% from a year earlier, C.B. "Jack" Rogers, chairman and chief executive, said.
The company, a provider of information for consumer financial transactions, expects to report that net income in the quarter rose about 10% on revenue growth of more than 9%.
In the 1992 fourth quarter, Equifax earned $26 million, or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $303.4 million.
For all of 1993, which Mr. Rogers characterized as a "record-breaking year," Equifax expects to report per-share profit, before unusual items, jumped more than 20% from a year earlier on revenue growth of more than 7%.
For 1992, Equifax reported earnings of $85.3 million, or $1.04 a share, on revenue of $1.13 billion.
Mr. Rogers said a reorganization of business units into four industry groups early in 1993, paved the way for the strong results.
