Media Vision Technology Inc. said it has been served with five lawsuits from shareholders alleging it violated securities laws through public statements preceding last week's announcement of an expected first-quarter loss.
The Fremont, Calif., maker of computer sound cards and other equipment denied the claims and indicated it intends to "vigorously" defend the suits, which it said were filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco Friday and Monday.
Media Vision's stock plummeted $10.50 Thursday to $11 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading after it disclosed that unexpected price cuts and delayed shipment of a product would lead to a "substantial" loss in the first quarter.
The stock fell $1 yesterday to $9.75.
Chief Executive Paul Jain told a March 16 analysts' conference that all appeared well with the company.
Management has since indicated it was not fully aware of the depth of the problems until days after those statements.
