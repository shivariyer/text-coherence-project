America Online Inc., already the darling of Wall Street for its role in the burgeoning computer on-line service market, reached a record high yesterday.
While the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 48.37 points, the share price for the Vienna, Va., company rose $8.75, or 11%, to $91.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
On Wednesday, the stock jumped $3.50, after jumping $4.75 on Tuesday.
Since Friday, the shares have jumped a staggering 25%, up $18.50.
The stock is trading at about 130 times its earnings, compared to 16.5 times for the Standard and Poor's 500-Stock Index and 25.5 times for software giant Microsoft Corp.
Reports that the company might be taken over drove the share price up earlier in the week.
But Steve Case, president and chief executive, said any takeover speculation is misguided.
"We've had no recent discussions with anybody about potential mergers," said Mr. Case.
