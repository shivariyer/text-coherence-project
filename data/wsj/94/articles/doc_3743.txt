Nissan Motor Co.'s truck-making affiliate will close an assembly operation in 1996, in the latest step toward consolidating Japan's bloated automotive industry.
Japan's car and truck makers have been slammed by a steep drop in demand for vehicles since 1990, but they have been hesitant to cut factory capacity.
Analysts think more shutdowns will follow as auto makers realize that sales probably won't revisit peak levels for years to come.
"This appears to be the first major closing by a truck maker, and it's not going to be the end," said Peter Boardman of UBS Securities Ltd.
Nissan Diesel Motor Co., 40%-owned by Nissan Motor, said it will close a midsize-truck assembly line in Gunma, Japan, in 1996 and shift production to another domestic factory.
A spokeswoman said the action will save one billion yen ($9.6 million) a year and reduce the company's capacity 20%, to 80,000 vehicles a year.
The company won't cut staff and will keep the plant open, making engines and transmissions.
Analysts say that will limit the cost savings achieved by the line closing.
Nissan Motor, Japan's No. 2 auto maker, has taken the most significant steps in the industry to reduce excess capacity.
It stunned the nation a year ago by announcing it will shut its Zama car-assembly plant in 1995.
The Zama closing will trim Nissan's overall production capacity by 10%.
