David Hale, a target in the Whitewater investigation, is expected to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy, according to a lawyer involved in the case against him.
Mr. Hale, a former municipal judge, is accused of committing fraud against the Small Business Administration in a case that has little to do with Whitewater.
But Mr. Hale has become a target of the investigation by special counsel Robert Fiske because he has alleged that President Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, pressured him into making a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, a partner in Whitewater Development Corp.
The Hale case previously had been prosecuted by Justice Department officials, but Mr. Fiske took it over after his appointment in late January because of Mr. Hale's allegations against President Clinton.
Mr. Hale's trial was set to begin next Monday.
Mr. Fiske's staff had hoped to try the case expeditiously so that Mr. Hale could be a witness in the Whitewater investigation.
The Hale case involved a tangled web of financings that the government alleged was used to prove to the SBA that Mr. Hale's Capital Management Services was entitled to about $900,000 in federally backed loans.
