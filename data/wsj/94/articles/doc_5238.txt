Italian luxury hotel chain Ciga SpA said its shareholders approved a previously announced plan to write down its ordinary capital to 57.263 billion lire ($34.3 million) from 150.793 billion lire, bringing the value of each ordinary share to about 379 lire.
Shareholders will be issued 30 new ordinary shares for every 79 ordinary shares held, with the aim of bringing the nominal value of each share back to 1,000 lire, the company said.
Ciga went into default on its loans last year, and its shares were suspended from the Milan stock exchange.
