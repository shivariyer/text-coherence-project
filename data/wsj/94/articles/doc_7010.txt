Motorola Inc. said its board approved a 2-for-1 stock split and increased the electronics company's quarterly dividend by 27%.
The board's moves reflect Motorola's continued strong showing in 1993.
Last month, the company reported an 88% surge in fourth-quarter profit and said it more than doubled its 1992 results for the year.
The stock split will be in the form of a stock dividend payable April 18 to holders of the company's shares on March 15.
The increased quarterly dividend, which rises to 14 cents from 11 cents, is effective on a pre-split basis with the same pay and record dates.
Motorola last split its stock and increased its dividend in 1992.
