Alan Lipton, president and chief executive officer, has assumed the posts of chairman and CEO on an interim basis, according to the jewelry designer and manufacturer.
Mr. Lipton, 43 years old, succeeds Lee A. Mills, 44, as chairman.
The company gave no reason for the change.
Neither Mr. Lipton nor Mr. Mills was available for comment.
Jan Bell said it is conducting a search to fill the positions of chairman and president with individuals with "in-depth retail experience and expertise."
The moves, the company said, are part of its transition from a wholesaler to a retailer.
As reported, Jan Bell expects to post operating losses for both the fourth quarter and full year.
The company said sales and margins were lower than expected.
