Sanyo Electric Co., a Japanese electronics concern, reported that its consolidated pretax profit for the year ended Nov. 30 surged from the previous year, but the gain was largely due to sales of securities holdings.
Sanyo's consolidated operating profit on its main business operations fell 13% to 10.04 billion yen ($92.4 million), and after taxes, Sanyo remained in the red.
Pretax profit jumped to 3.23 billion yen, from 562 million yen.
But the net loss grew to 1.56 billion yen from 1.29 billion yen the previous year.
Sales edged down 0.7% to 1.527 trillion yen.
Sanyo predicted that in the current fiscal year it will return to profitability on a consolidated net basis, with rising sales and pretax profits.
The company cited healthy economic conditions in Asia and the U.S., as well as its efforts to restructure and pursue new business opportunities.
Domestic sales dropped 2.7% to 882.35 billion yen, or 58% of total group sales, while overseas sales rose 2.3% to 644.44 billion yen, or 42% of overall sales.
