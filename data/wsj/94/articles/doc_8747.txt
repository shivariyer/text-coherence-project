Cygnus Therapeutic Systems said it filed suit in federal court in San Francisco against Alza Corp., alleging antitrust violations and patent fraud.
The allegations involve a skin patch that delivers fentanyl, a pain killer.
Both companies have developed, or are developing, versions of this patch.
Cygnus alleges that Alza used various misrepresentations to obtain a patent for its patch in 1986, and thereby stifled competition.
A spokeswoman for Alza, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said the company had no knowledge of the suit.
