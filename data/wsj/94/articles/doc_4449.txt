MCN Corp. said its Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. unit filed an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking approval for a $170 million expansion project in northern Michigan.
Under the plan, MCN would add 177 miles of pipeline and natural gas treatment facilities to the company's existing gas transmission system in the state.
If approved, the project could begin this year.
