Savings-and-loan associations earned $1.19 billion in the fourth quarter of 1993, a 53% increase from the $777 million a year earlier, the Office of Thrift Supervision said.
Continuing its recovery from the financial collapse of the 1980s, the industry recorded its 12th-consecutive profitable quarter in the October-December period of last year.
For all of 1993, however, thrifts' net income eased to $5 billion from $5.1 billion in 1992, the thrift regulator said.
Improved fourth-quarter earnings resulted largely from a continued decline in "troubled assets," said Jonathan Fiechter, the OTS's acting director.
Troubled assets declined to $17 billion, or 2.2% of total assets, at the end of 1993, from $20 billion, or 2.5%, at the end of the third quarter and from $25 billion, or 3.1%, at the end of 1992.
Many private-sector S&Ls are reducing their troubled-asset inventory as their financial condition improves, or through acquisition by a betterheeled thrift.
At the end of 1993, only one thrift was "critically undercapitalized," and it since has been acquired by another S&L, the OTS said.
The Resolution Trust Corp., the government's thrift-cleanup agency, took over seven failed S&Ls in 1993, down from 60 in 1992 and a peak of 319 in 1989.
The spread between average interest rates on borrowed money and rates charged for loans remained relatively wide, also bolstering profits, the OTS said.
The spread at the end of 1993 was 2.95 percentage points, down slightly from 2.98 points at the end of the third quarter and 3.0 points at the end of 1992, but well ahead of narrower spreads that prevailed until late 1992.
At the end of last year, the OTS regulated 1,669 S&Ls, down from 1,871 a year earlier.
The number of "problem" thrifts -- those regarded by regulatory examiners as having the most-severe problems -- declined by more than 50% to 101 institutions during 1993, the OTS said.
