Your Feb. 16 editorial "Weather Blather" demands accolades.
It is time to expose this cult of precipitation-tolerance-impaired meteorologists and "news" staff members inhabiting the airways.

This leaves only the on-air personalities to bemoan a natural occurrence as if it were yet another example of the decline of America.
Meanwhile, I'm enjoying a hot toddy while contemplating another Calvin (& Hobbes)-esque snow sculpture.
