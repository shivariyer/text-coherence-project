HealthTrust Inc. signed a contract to buy a nonprofit Nashville, Tenn., hospital.
It is paying $76 million to a charitable foundation to buy Nashville Memorial Hospital from nonprofit Nashville Memorial Health Systems Inc. which runs the 300-bed facility, according to Nashville Memorial officials.
HealthTrust, based in Nashville, Tenn., wouldn't comment on details of the acquisition.
Nashville Memorial currently relies on Medicare patients for about 60% of its business; the acquisition will allow it to attract a broader clientele and referrals from HealthTrust's 10 other hospitals in the area, according to William Puryear, chairman of the hospital.
HealthTrust is the second-largest U.S. chain, with 81 hospitals in 21 states.
