Owens & Minor Inc. and Stuart Medical Inc. said the Justice Department completed its antitrust review of the companies' proposed combination without requesting more information.
Richmond, Va.-based Owens & Minor, the nation's second-largest distributor of medical and surgical supplies, in December said it planned to purchase closely held Stuart Medical, Greensburg, Pa., for $40.2 million in cash and $115 million of convertible preferred stock.
The purchase of Stuart Medical, also a distributor of medical and surgical supplies, is expected to close soon after an Owens & Minor shareholder vote that is expected to be held in April.
