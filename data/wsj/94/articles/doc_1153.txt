The Paramount Building, the structurally-troubled office tower rising 44 stories above the southwest corner of Central Park, will be stripped to its girders next year and rebuilt with both offices and luxury condominiums.
General Electric Co.'s GE Investments unit, which took the 23-year-old property back last year from a limited partnership managed by First Winthrop Corp., said it had formed a joint venture with Galbreath Co. and Trump Organization to redevelop the property.
The 650,000-square-foot building, which was once known as the Gulf & Western building, has been plagued for years with structural problems, which cause it to sway so much in high winds that it disrupts elevator service and damages the facade of the building.
Even before it agreed to be acquired by Viacom Inc., Paramount Communications Inc., which occupies most of the space, had decided to move its headquarters when its lease expired in April 1995.
The accounting firm occupying most of the remaining space also planned to leave.
"We are going to skin the building, strip it down, solve the structural problems, take the asbestos out, and put in new elevator cores," explained Peter Ricker, president and chief executive officer of Galbreath, a New York and Columbus, Ohio-based real-estate company.
He said that the offices on the top 28 or 29 floors would be replaced with luxury condominiums, and the lower floors would remain commercial space.
