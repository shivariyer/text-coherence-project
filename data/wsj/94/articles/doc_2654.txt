Your Jan. 27 Politics & Policy article "Blacks' Increasing Vocal Opposition to Violence Is Matched by Strong Opposition to Crime Bill" gives the Nation of Islam undue credit when you say its leadership has "spoken out against crime and for the kind of values that make it unacceptable."
The Nation of Islam's leadership, on and off campus, preaches selective violence and the "value" of bigotry.
Last Nov. 29, for instance, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, one of the Nation of Islam's leading spokesmen, gave his "stump" speech at Kean College in New Jersey.
The value he ascribed to interreligious respect was clear: "{T}he old, no good Pope, you know that cracker, somebody need to raise that dress up and see what's really there."
He preached about killing all white South Africans (babies included) if they do not get out of the country in 24 hours.
He laughed when he described "political prisoners" in the U.S., who became such when they "put the gun to the white judge's head . . . and they blew the judge's head off."
He said "the white man is the devil."
According to Muhammad, the lesson of World War II was that "Everybody always talk {sic} about Hitler exterminating six million Jews.
But don't nobody {sic} ever ask, `What did they do to Hitler?'"
Minister Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, has not only refused to repudiate Muhammad's remarks, but has accused Jews and others of using "Khalid's words against us."
When white racist organizations speak out about "crime" and "values," as they do from time to time, we expect the media not to take their words at face value, but to report them in the context of their speakers' hateful agenda.
The Nation of Islam's pronouncements are no less selective and bone-chilling.
