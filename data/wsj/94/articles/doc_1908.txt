Tanknology Environmental Inc. said it will report a loss for the first quarter because some major customers are delaying annual tank-testing programs.
The Houston company also said it will resume its stock buyback program approved in 1992.
Tanknology, which currently has about 15 million common shares outstanding, is authorized to buy back as many as 600,000 shares.
The environmental-services concern said it doesn't expect the loss for the quarter to exceed the loss of $515,000, or three cents a share, reported for the 1992 first quarter.
For the 1993 first quarter, Tanknology had net income of $265,000, or two cents a share.
"Although first-quarter operating profits will decline, management remains optimistic regarding the full-year outlook," said Donald R. Campbell, president and chief operating officer.
"Federal and state regulations call for tank tightness testing to be completed by Dec. 22 of each year.
We are seeing strong indications that many of our customers are deferring testing to periods nearer the deadline."
