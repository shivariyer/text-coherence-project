Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. said that releasing government reports on the death of White House lawyer Vincent Foster would hamper his continuing investigations.
Mr. Fiske's position was disclosed in court papers filed in connection with a lawsuit by Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, and Robert Bartley, editor of the newspaper, to force the release of the reports.
The suit is pending in a federal district court in New York.
Releasing the reports, prepared by the police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, "would substantially prejudice the ability of the Office of Independent Counsel to conduct its investigation," Mr. Fiske said in a letter to the Justice Department filed with court papers yesterday.
Mr. Foster was deputy White House counsel when he apparently shot himself in a park outside Washington on July 20.
The U.S. Park Police ruled it a suicide.
Mr. Bartley on Aug. 18 requested the reports under the Freedom of Information Act.
The reports weren't released, and he and the paper sued the Justice Department in January.
Mr. Fiske was appointed to examine President Clinton and Hillary Clinton's investment in Whitewater Development Corp., and he also is looking into Mr. Foster's death.
In the letter to the Justice Department, Mr. Fiske said the testimony of some witnesses could be tainted if they knew the contents of the reports.
Mr. Bartley said, "Curiously, the government's reply does not move to dismiss the complaint.
Whatever the judge rules, we will express our views in the newspaper."
