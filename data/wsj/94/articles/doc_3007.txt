The Clinton administration tomorrow plans to unveil its long-awaited plan to restructure the federal unemployment and job-training system.
The plan, expected to cost $13 billion over five years, would consolidate six federal training and job-search programs into "one-stop shopping" that would treat unemployed workers the same no matter why they lost their jobs.
The program would try to get those who have been permanently cut from their jobs into job training sooner by sorting those unemployed workers from others who are temporarily laid off.
The government also would pay for long-term training programs, which have been shown to be more effective.
Participants would receive income support during that time, rather than getting only 26 weeks of unemployment benefits.
In addition, drafts of the proposal say, the unemployed who find new work faster would received "re-employment bonuses" equal to a portion of their unemployment benefits.
Workers also could use unemployment benefits to create their own businesses.
