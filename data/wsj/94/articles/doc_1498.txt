American Oilfield Divers Inc. said it expects about break-even results for its fiscal second quarter, which ends April 30.
For the year-earlier period, the company had net income of $914,000, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $13.2 million.
A spokesman for the Lafayette, La., diving-services company said earnings were affected by harsh weather in the Gulf of Mexico, which limited the days in which employees could work.
However, the spokesman said he believes work the company couldn't perform will be picked up in future quarters, and not lost permanently.
