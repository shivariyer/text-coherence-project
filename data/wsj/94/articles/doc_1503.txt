South Korea's exports to the U.S. will snap years of sluggishness this year, by rising 5% year-to-year to $19 billion, thanks to shipments of electronics goods, machinery and automobiles, a state-run trade association said.
The forecast was based on expectations the U.S. economy will show 3% growth this year, triggering a rise of 10% in demand for imports, the Korea Foreign Trade Association said.
South Korean exports to the U.S., its single-largest export market, have been lethargic since 1989, dropping or rising less than 1% each year because of an erosion in international competitiveness.
