Your Jan. 21 page-one article "Paying the Price" does not reflect the whole story, at least as it applies to the The Guardian.
The article stated that 30 insurance agents from four companies were fined or suspended last year for "churning" insurance policies.
Guardian Life was listed as one of these companies.
In the interest of fairness let us review the record: The New York State Insurance Department in its January-February 1993 Bulletin listed the revocation of a Guardian agent's license for violation of Regulation 60 (required disclosure in a replacement sale).
The violation referred to occurred in 1989.
The cited agent's license to represent Guardian Life was terminated on May 15, 1990.
