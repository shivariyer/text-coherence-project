Carr Realty Corp. said its Carr Realty L.P. acquired a 12-story office building one block west of the White House for cash, stock and the assumption of debt.
The purchase of the 140,000-square-foot building was financed by issuing about 174,000 units of limited-partnership interest in Carr Realty, valued at about $4 million; the assumption of about $13.4 million of debt; and cash payments of about $1.6 million, Carr said.
