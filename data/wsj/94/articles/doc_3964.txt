A Senate committee approved legislation that would loosen certain water-cleanup requirements on local governments, increase federal loans to improve sewage treatment, and increase U.S. regulation of "non-point" runoff such as pesticides that wash off farmland into lakes and streams.
Revisions to the 1972 Clean Water Act, which were supported by the Clinton administration, don't include a proposal favored by the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a plan to reduce or prohibit discharge of chlorine and chlorinated compounds into water.
When the administration unveiled the chlorine proposal earlier this month, it drew immediate fire from the chemical and paper industries.
Chlorine, used to bleach pulp in the manufacture of paper, concerns environmentalists because it breaks down into dioxin and other potentially toxic chemicals that end up in food through fish and other animals.
The legislation, which the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee cleared on a 14-3 vote, now goes to the Senate floor.
No action has yet been taken on the bill in the House.
The bill would authorize $2.5 billion for a fund for sewage treatment this year, and another $500 million in 1995.
