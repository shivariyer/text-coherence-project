Tenneco Inc. said one of its units sold a 20% stake in a natural-gas marketing and pipeline subsidiary to Ruhrgas, a German natural-gas concern.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The unit, Tenneco Gas, sold Ruhrgas an interest in its Tenneco Energy Resources Corp.
With annual revenue of more than $2 billion, Tenneco Energy Resources includes operations in natural-gas marketing, gathering, processing and trading, in addition to 2,000 miles of pipelines, mostly in Texas.
Tenneco Gas and Ruhrgas also agreed to jointly pursue projects of common interest in the European energy market.
