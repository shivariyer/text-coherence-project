Ajinomoto Co., a Japanese foods, seasonings and pharmaceuticals concern, reached a world-wide licensing agreement with a unit of Sandoz AG of Switzerland for what Ajinomoto says is one of its "most promising" diabetes drugs.
Ajinomoto will supply the medicine in bulk to allow Sandoz Pharma to market the drug globally except in Japan, the U.K., China, South Korea and Taiwan, where Ajinomoto plans to sell the product.
An Ajinomoto spokesman wouldn't disclose the value of royalties.
Ajinomoto said the drug, called A-4166, is effective in quickly preventing diabetics from having a high blood-sugar level after a meal by increasing insulin production.
The company says the drug has fewer side effects and is superior to sulphonylureas currently used to treat diabetes.
