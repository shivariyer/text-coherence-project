Morningstar Group Inc. said C. Dean Metropolous, 47-year-old chairman of the specialty-foods company, was named to the additional posts of president and chief executive officer.
He succeeds James A. Bach, 44, who the company said resigned to pursue other interests.
Mr. Bach declined to comment on his departure.
Morningstar posted a net loss of $4.2 million, or 28 cents a share, on sales of $106.3 million for the fourth quarter last year.
Mr. Metropolous, formerly president and chief executive of Stella Foods Inc., was brought in as chairman Dec. 15 to improve the company's performance.
In January, Morningstar announced a restructuring of operations and suspended its dividend.
Mr. Metropolous, who said he hadn't anticipated taking over the additional posts at the time he was named chairman, said he will continue to work on acquisitions with Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc., the private leveraged-buyout concern that acquired Morningstar in 1991 and took it public the following year.
Mr. Metropolous also said that the company may bring in a new chief executive "at some point down the road," but that for now he will focus on the restructuring of the company, and on making niche acquisitions that extend Morningstar's market penetration in various parts of the country.
He said the company is in discussions regarding several potential acquisitions, but declined to provide details.
