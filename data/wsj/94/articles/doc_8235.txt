Degussa AG's supervisory board approved the proposal to pay a dividend of seven marks a share ($4.03) for the year that ended Sept. 30.
The German specialty chemicals and metals company paid seven marks the previous two fiscal years.
Degussa's supervisory board also voted to cut the size of Degussa's board by two members.
The reduction is connected with the winding up of its two-year restructuring program.
"The goal of paring down the company's sectors and decentralizing management, which will be significantly finished in 1994, has resulted in a further tightening in the highest management level," the company said.
