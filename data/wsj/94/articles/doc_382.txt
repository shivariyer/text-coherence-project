Interstate Bakeries Corp. reported a fiscal third-quarter loss of $2.5 million, or 12 cents a share, reflecting a bakery swap, an environmental problem and lower sales.
Interstate, of Kansas City, Mo., said the loss included a one-time pretax charge of $9.4 million, or 28 cents a share, covering its exchange of a Dolly Madison bakery in Los Angeles for a Wonder Bread bakery in Tampa, Fla., owned by Ralston Purina Co.'s Continental Baking Group.
About $2 million of the charge increased reserves for potential environmental liability on underground storage tanks at a Glendale, Calif., facility.
The company earned $5 million, or 24 cents a share, in the same period last year.
Sales in the quarter slipped 2.4% to $336.3 million from $344.6 million a year earlier.
Interstate closed at $13.125, down 12.5 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
