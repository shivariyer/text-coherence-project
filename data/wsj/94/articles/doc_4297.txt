Chrysler Corp. said it will sell its Acustar electrical wiring business to its supplier, American Yazaki Corp., the U.S. unit of Japan's Yazaki Corp.
The amount wasn't disclosed.
The No. 3 auto maker, based in Highland Park, Mich., has been selling off parts of its Acustar division since 1992.
All that will remain of the Acustar unit after the sale of the electrical wiring division are operations for electronics, glass and thermal and trim products.
The electrical wiring division is Acustar's largest employer, employing 11,000 workers, mostly in Mexico.
The division has eight wire-harness assembly plants in Mexico and was profitable last year, with sales of $300 million, a Chrysler spokeswoman said.
Chrysler said it will continue to purchase products manufactured by the wiring division for use in Chrysler vehicles.
