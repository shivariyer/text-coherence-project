Calgene Inc. said it received approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to sell a strain of cotton that has been genetically engineered to resist damage from bromoxynil, a weed-killer opposed by environmental groups.
It is the first approval of a major field crop under a 1993 USDA rule regulating genetically engineered products, though the agency previously approved a Calgene tomato produced using similar techniques.
(The acreage used for tomatoes is relatively small.)
The company is awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval of a gene used in both crops before beginning high-volume shipments of its cotton, said John Callahan, Calgene's senior vice president in charge of cotton.
Once that final hurdle is cleared, Calgene BXN cotton that has been field-tested can be grown and shipped anywhere in the U.S. without special approvals, just like conventional cotton, the company said.
The USDA decision is a milestone in a 10-year partnership of Calgene and Rhone-Poulenc AG, the French company that sells bromoxynil under the trade name Buctril.
Calgene contends that the BXN cotton allows farmers to use relatively small amounts of Buctril, which is a more efficient weed killer than other herbicides used now.
Calgene estimates that its cotton, if used by all U.S. cotton growers, could reduce their herbicide use by nine million pounds annually.
But environmental groups argue that Buctril can cause birth defects in farm workers exposed to the herbicide, and are pushing instead for farmers to use organic methods that use no chemicals.
"Many people are finding that their yields are better with organic cotton," said Rebecca Goldberg, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington.
Dr. Goldberg said the Environmental Protection Agency must approve the use of Buctril on cotton.
"We are taking our case to EPA," she said.
Yesterday, Calgene stock jumped 75 cents, or 6.4%, to close at $12.50 a share in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
