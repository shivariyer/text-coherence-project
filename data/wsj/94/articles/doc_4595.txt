Hershey Foods Corp. is introducing two new candies, one a nut-covered bar and the other licorice strings.
NutRageous, a bar featuring Reese's peanut butter, caramel and roasted peanuts covered with Hershey's milk chocolate, is rolling out nationally now.
The bar is the first line extension of the Reese's brand since Reese's Pieces were launched in 1978.
Also appearing at candy counters soon will be Pull-N-Peel, cherry-flavored licorice that peels off a stick in strings.
An extension of Hershey's Twizzlers licorice line, the product is what the company said was "the first of what we hope is a growing array" of such candies.
