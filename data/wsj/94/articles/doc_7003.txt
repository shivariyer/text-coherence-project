Higher taxes and lower investment yields strained fourth-quarter results at American General Corp.
The insurance and financial-services company had a loss of $163.5 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with profit of $133.7 million, or 62 cents a share, for the year-ago quarter.
Results included a previously announced $300 million charge to write down acquisition-related goodwill in its life-insurance division.
Earnings before the charge were $136.5 million, or 63 cents a share, at the low end of analysts' expectations.
In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, American General was down 37.5 cents at $28.25.
For the year, American General earned $204 million, or 94 cents a share, after one-time charges, up from $533 million, or $2.45 a share, a year earlier.
Assets grew 11% to $43.98 billion from $39.74 billion.
American General said profit in its life-insurance division fell 9.9%.
Sales gains in the division were more than offset by lower investment yields and a $21 million increase in income-tax expense that resulted from the loss of some tax benefits.
Earnings rose 25% in the retirement-annuities division and increased 28% in the consumer-finance division.
President James R. Tuerff said the company expects continued sales growth in 1994 in life insurance.
In addition, American General plans to increase its annuities sales force to 840 representatives from 740 this year, and projects better returns in consumer finance through new products and a computerized accounting system.
