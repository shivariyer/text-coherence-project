Quebec separatist leader Lucien Bouchard predicted that if Quebec were to separate from Canada, it wouldn't have any problem joining the North American Free Trade Agreement.
U.S. political analysts, however, said Mr. Bouchard had no grounds for making such an assumption about Nafta, which was negotiated by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, and provides for a gradual elimination of their trade barriers.
Mr. Bouchard, in a speech here to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, "It seems far-fetched to presume" that the existing North American free trade relationship would be upset by Quebec becoming independent.
Quebec is included "in a vast and expanding free-trade zone, and this will not change," he said.
William Merkin, a trade consultant and a former U.S. trade negotiator, said talks will be required if Quebec becomes a sovereign state and wants to join Nafta.
He said the U.S. administration would need congressional authority to enter into the negotiations.
Any agreement with Quebec also would require congressional approval, he said.
Mr. Bouchard, who leads the Bloc Quebecois Party, said the U.S. market is the key to Quebec's future growth and prosperity.
He said that if Quebec holds an independence vote within the next 18 months, as he expects, the separatists will focus their campaign on the economic benefits of separation from Canada.
In the past, the separatists have demanded Quebec independence to assure the survival of the province's distinctive culture, including the French language.
Mr. Bouchard predicted the independence debate will now take an economic focus, because "we have achieved a reasonable degree of security concerning our identity."
