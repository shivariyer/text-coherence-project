In another sign of emerging drug-industry price wars, SmithKline Beecham Inc. priced its new chemotherapy product at a healthy discount compared with a competitor's nausea treatment.
SmithKline will bill U.S. wholesalers 7.2% less for Kytril than Glaxo Holdings PLC charges for its competing drug Zofran, according to SmithKline spokesman Richard Koenig.
The Kytril pricing provides the second indication in less than a week that the pharmaceutical industry is finally succumbing to competitive pressures.
Just last week, Sandoz AG said it would sell its cholesterol-lowering drug Lescol at a 50% discount to its competitors.
Historically, drug companies have priced new drugs at a premium to existing products, using the justification that they are either safer or more effective.
Now, the nation's new-found sensitivity toward health-care spending is causing the landscape to shift.
Whether Kytril's competitive price will allow SmithKline to cut into the estimated $400 million-a-year market for Zofran remains to be seen.
