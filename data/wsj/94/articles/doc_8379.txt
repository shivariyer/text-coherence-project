The province of Ontario plans to issue more than one billion Canadian dollars (US$763.3 million) of debt securities over the next few weeks.
The financings will include the province's first global U.S. dollar floating rate note.
The Ontario government said it will do the financings when market conditions allow.
Bond traders expect the issues next week.
Government officials said proceeds of the issues will cover the province's C$600 million borrowing requirement for the fiscal year ending March 1994, and prefund borrowing needs for the next fiscal year.
They didn't provide details of the size of the offerings, but past global issues by the province have raised more than C$1 billion each.
The U.S. global note issue will be jointly lead-managed by Lehman Bros. and Merrill Lynch & Co. of New York, while a Canadian-dollar global issue will be underwritten by a group headed by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
