This maker of intimate apparel said its founder and president, Cecelia Post, resigned after eight years with the company "to pursue other interests in the fashion industry."
Ms. Post, 42 years old, didn't return calls seeking comment.
Stephen Davis, 54, who recently joined the company as senior vice president, left the company; Body Drama has since eliminated his position.
Thomas P. Baumann, chief financial officer, and Eugene B. Price II, a director of Body Drama's majority owner, Beeba's Creations Inc. of San Diego, assumed the board seats vacated by Ms. Post and Mr. Davis.
