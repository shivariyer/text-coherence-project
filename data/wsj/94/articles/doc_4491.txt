ASK Group Inc. said it named Eric Carlson president and chief executive officer, part of a series of management changes at the software concern.
Mr. Carlson, 49 years old, was an executive vice president of ASK.
He succeeds Pier Carlo Falotti, who left the software concern unexpectedly this month, citing personal reasons.
In addition, ASK said Paul C. Ely Jr., a 62-year-old partner with venture-capital firm Alpha Partners, will become chairman.
Mr. Ely, a director since 1989, succeeds Sandy Kurtzig, who resigned in September.
Robert H. Waterman Jr., head of the Waterman Group Inc., was named vice chairman.
ASK, hurt by slumping sales, had a net loss of $13.7 million, or 59 cents a share, in its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, ASK shares closed up 62.5 cents, or 7.6%, at $8.875.
