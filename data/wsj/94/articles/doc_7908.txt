CardioPulmonics Inc. said it withdrew its application to the Food and Drug Administration for premarket approval of its IVOX (R) intravascular oxygenator , a device that supplements the action of the lungs.
The withdrawal follows indications from the FDA that the company would have to expand its clinical trials to meet the approval standards.
CardioPulmonics also said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire InnerDyne Medical Inc. , a closely held maker of medical devices based in Sunnyvale, Calif.
Under terms of the deal, shareholders of InnerDyne would receive shares equal to 48% of CardioPulmonics' outstanding shares.
On the Nasdaq Stock Market, CardioPulmonics shares closed at $1.96875, down 3.125 cents.
