Bad weather and delays in international shipments led Intellicall Inc. to report, as expected, net losses for the fourth quarter of 1993 and year on substantial declines in revenue.
The pay-telephone products and services concern reported a net loss of $2.1 million, or 25 cents a share, narrowing from a net loss of $21.9 million, or $3.27 a share, in the year-earlier period.
For the year, Intellicall reported a net loss of $1.3 million, or 17 cents a share, versus a net loss of $24.9 million, or $3.71 a share, in 1992.
The year-earlier figures for both the quarter and the year include a $22 million charge to settle shareholder litigation, account for losses related to one of its billing agents, and to establish a reserve for receivables.
Revenues for the quarter declined 42% to $17.1 million from $29.5 million; for the year, they dropped 46% to $85.1 million from $158 million.
The company previously said that $23 million in planned fourth-quarter shipments of pay phones to Argentina and Indonesia were delayed because testing and certification in each country took longer than expected.
Revenue also dropped because bad weather, particularly in the Northeast, cut pay-phone traffic, since many pay phones are outdoors.
The company also said operating costs rose, in part because of costs associated with a planned public stock offering that Intellicall has now withdrawn.
Intellicall said it doesn't expect first-quarter results for this year to show any improvement from its fourth quarter.
