Barnes & Noble Inc., which went public in October, reported a 81% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter profit, reflecting stronger sales at the bookseller's superstores.
Net income for the quarter ended Jan. 29 rose to $27.1 million, or 87 cents a share, from $15 million, or 67 cents a share a year ago.
The year-ago figure included a one-time extraordinary loss of $8.7 million, or 39 cents a share, for early payment of debt and accounting changes.
Revenue rose nearly 19% to $483.7 million.
The New York company partly attributed its improved earnings to the success and "critical mass" achieved by its superstores.
As of Jan. 29, Barnes & Noble operated 203 superstores, 72 of which were opened in 1993 under the Barnes & Noble, Bookstop and Bookstar tradenames.
It also operated 734 mall stores under the B. Dalton Bookseller, Doubleday Book Shops and Scribner's Bookstores names.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Barnes & Noble shares closed at $26.25, down $1.
