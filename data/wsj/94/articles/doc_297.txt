Lockheed Corp. said it would reduce operations at its aeronautical-systems unit, mainly at its Marietta, Ga., plant, by cutting more than 2,000 jobs by the end of 1995.
The military aerospace and electronics concern, which is based in Calabasas, Calif., and employs 83,500, said the reductions reflect a transition from production of its C-130H military transport to the new model, the C-130J, and the completion of its P-3 maritime patrol-aircraft program.
Employment at Marietta and several feeder plants, which peaked at 33,000 in 1969 during production of the C-5A transport, will be cut back at midyear from the current level of 11,700, a Lockheed spokesman said.
Lockheed also makes the F-22 Air Force fighter at the aeronautical-systems unit.
