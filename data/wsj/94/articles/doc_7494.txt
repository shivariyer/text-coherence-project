Rank Organisation PLC, a British leisure concern, named Sir Denys Henderson its future chairman.
Sir Denys, 61 years old, is currently chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and Zeneca Group PLC, but plans to retire from those posts in 1995.
He will become a non-executive director at Rank on March 1, and take over the chairmanship of the company next year.
The Rank position will be a big change for Sir Denys, who has worked since 1957 for ICI, a sprawling chemicals company with annual sales of $18 billion.
At ICI, he has overseen the spinoff last year of Zeneca, which produces drugs, pesticides and industrial chemicals, and the subsequent streamlining of both companies.
Rank's activities are a world apart from those at ICI and Zeneca.
At Rank, Sir Denys will take the helm of a company with such activities as film, videos, hotels, theme parks and nightclubs.
It also controls 49% of the photocopier concern Rank Xerox.
Sir Denys will replace current Rank Chairman Sir Leslie Fletcher, who at age 71 has been planning to retire for more than a year.
