The number of Japanese-affiliated manufacturing plants in the U.S. dropped last year, the first decline since a Japanese government trade group began its survey 13 years ago.
Plant closings and the sale of Japanese-affiliated plants were the main reasons the number fell to 1,695 plants, down 1.7% from 1,724 in 1992, according to the Japan External Trade Organization.
The plants averaged an employment of 233, down from 294 in 1992, mainly because of corporate restructuring.
Total employment at Japanese-affiliated plants is estimated at about 400,000.
