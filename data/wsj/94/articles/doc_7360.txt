Interest rates on credit cards and loans would be free of caps permanently under a measure before New York's Legislature.
A "banking deregulation" bill needs to be signed into law by midnight today if New York is to continue the system that since 1980 has kept a state cap off interest rates.
Negotiations by the state's Senate the Assembly and Gov. Mario Cuomo's staff failed to produce a bill last July, setting up the current deadline.
Portions of the measure were still in dispute yesterday, but negotiators were trying to draft a wide-ranging bill that would continue to give banks the ability to set whatever rates they want for credit cards and most loans.
Banks have had those powers since 1980, but in the past the Legislature has extended deregulation only temporarily.
Negotiators also seek a bill requiring banks to offer low-cost checking accounts to provide poor people with nofrills services; creating a toll-free state consumer-information banking hotline; and clamping down on discrimination by banks based on where people live, among other provisions.
