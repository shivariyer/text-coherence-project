State and local government finance officers urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to shelve a controversial proposal intended to end the use of political gifts to state and local officials to win bond business.
The Government Finance Officers Association assailed the proposal, saying it would be a disadvantage to state and local officials running for federal office, as well as to small, regional and other securities firms.
It said the proposal rests on the erroneous assumption that any link between political gifts and the selection of bond underwriters is an investor protection issue.
The association's action came as a surprise to regulators.
A professional association of state and local finance officers long influential in municipal bond regulatory issues, the GFOA has worked closely with the SEC on other municipal bond matters and until now had taken a low profile on the proposal.
The proposed rule was drafted by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, a self-regulatory body subject to SEC oversight.
It would bar a dealer from doing business with a bond issuer within two years of the dealer, its political action committee, or its municipal professionals making political gifts to an official of the issuer.
