Citicorp reassigned the head of its huge U.S. consumer banking operations to run global transactions services.
James L. Bailey, executive vice president, had overseen both credit cards and branch banking in the U.S., which together contributed $6.6 billion in annual revenue.
He will be overseeing a pared-down transaction-services group, which is responsible for cash management, securities services and trade products for institutional customers world-wide.
Last year that area had revenue of $1.8 billion.
However, two pieces of the group are being split off and overseen by other executives.
While company's Citibank unit had brought together under Mr. Bailey both branch banking and credit cards in the U.S., those businesses are once again being split up.
Roberta Arena, formerly the head of European credit cards, will oversee credit cards in both Europe and the U.S.
And Victor Menezes, currently head of European consumer banking, will oversee branch banking in both the U.S. and Europe.
Ms. Arena is expected to be named to the banking company's so-called group of 15 executive committee, which would make her the only woman on the senior policy-making body.
Mr. Menezes already sits on the group.
A spokesman declined comment.
One executive maintained it was not a demotion for Mr. Bailey because he was being asked to improve the efficiency of the business.
And others point out that Mr. Bailey has been in the U.S. -- and in consumer banking -- for much of his career and will now receive overseas and corporate responsibilities as well.
Alan Weber, who had been head of the former financial institutions and transactions-services group, will become head of consumer banking in Latin America.
The appointments are effective April 1.
