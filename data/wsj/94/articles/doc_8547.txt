Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. said it will redeem its $200 million aggregate principal amount of 11.25% senior notes due 1999 with the proceeds from its offering of $250 million of 6.75% senior notes.
Mitchell said it will call for redemption of the 11.25% notes in late February after the offering of the 6.75% notes, scheduled to close Jan. 25.
The company said it will redeem the 11.25% notes at the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued interest and a $6.4 million pre-payment premium.
Mitchell said it will realize $9 million in annual interest savings as a result of the senior note refinancing, and it also will use proceeds from the offering to pay down bank debt.
CS First Boston and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are managing the offering.
