Martin Marietta Corp. said it was awarded a $163 million contract from the U.S. Navy to supply three additional Aegis weapons systems on Arleigh Burke class destroyers.
The contract includes options for three to five more systems, which could total as much as $266 million, the defense contractor said.
As of the end of 1993, 29 ships with Aegis systems had been commissioned into Navy service.
Aegis is a shipboard system of computers, sensors and weapons systems that can detect, track and engage hundreds of targets simultaneously.
Martin Marietta's Government Electronic Systems in Moorestown, N.J., will produce the systems, which are expected to be delivered beginning in 1997.
