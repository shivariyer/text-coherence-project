Federal fish regulators unveiled a much-anticipated plan to save Northwestern salmon, but the plan differs only modestly from past failed efforts to help the rapidly declining fish.
The plan was worked out by the National Marine Fisheries Service, in coordination with three agencies involved in the operation of the huge dams along the Columbia and Snake rivers in Oregon, Washington and Idaho.
Those dams are the main culprits in the salmon's rapid decline, which has seen fish numbers plunge to less than two million today from about 16 million a few decades ago.
The dams mince salmon by the millions and slow down river flows, making it impossible for salmon to migrate between spawning grounds and the sea.
The centerpiece of the new plan is a proposal to increase flows in the two rivers by roughly 50% at certain times of the year, in hopes of speeding salmon downstream.
Some environmentalists called the plan a step in the right direction.
However, most environmentalists and many scientists believe more-drastic changes in the way the dams are operated are needed to save the fish.
