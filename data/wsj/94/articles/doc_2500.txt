AB Volvo, the Swedish automotive group, reported that its 1993 pretax loss narrowed to 2.64 billion kronor ($330.8 million) from 4.75 billion kronor a year earlier.
The 1993 loss was attributed to the inclusion of a charge of 5.2 billion kronor related to the dissolution of the cross-ownership between Volvo and French auto maker Renault.
Volvo and Renault agreed to dissolve their planned merger last year.
The loss was in line with expectations, since Volvo had already announced its intention to book the charges related to Renault against 1993 earnings.
Volvo reported a net loss of 3.47 billion kronor, widening from 3.32 billion kronor.
The group swung to an operating profit of 1.55 billion kronor from a loss of 2.25 billion kronor, with both car and truck operations swinging to operating profits.
