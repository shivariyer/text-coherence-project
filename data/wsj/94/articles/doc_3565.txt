The Supreme Court said a defendant who wins a copyright lawsuit should have the same right as a victorious plaintiff to recover attorneys' fees.
The action reversed a lower-court ruling that said winning plaintiffs generally should be awarded their lawyers' fees as a matter of course, while winning defendants should collect fees only if they show that the original suit was frivolous or brought in "bad faith."
The federal Copyright Act requires that winning plaintiffs and defendants in copyright disputes be treated equally on the legal-fees issue, a unanimous high court said.
The actual decision regarding whether to force a losing party to pay the winner's legal expenses should be left to the discretion of the trial judge, the high court added.
The ruling was a partial victory for rock singer John Fogerty.
He had successfully defended a copyright-infringement suit filed by a music company that accused him of unlawfully remaking one of his old songs, the rights to which the company had acquired.
Two lower courts had denied Mr. Fogerty's request that his legal fees be reimbursed by the company.
The high court yesterday sent the case back to a federal appeals court with instructions that an "evenhanded" approach be used in deciding whether Mr. Fogerty should be reimbursed.

Separately, the high court dismissed a closely watched securities-law case because the parties settled their dispute.
The case presented the question of whether a federal law barring fraud in initial public sales of stock also applies to resales of the shares.
Lower federal courts have issued conflicting rulings on the scope of the provision, known as Section 12 (2) of the Securities Act of 1933.
