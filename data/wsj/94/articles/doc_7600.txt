I agree that America has entered a third industrial revolution, as Michael C. Jensen states in his Jan. 3 article "A Revolution Only Markets Could Love."
In fact, we agree so much with the premise of the article that we divested ourselves of General Tire seven years ago.
Unfortunately, Mr. Jensen suggests GenCorp is still in the tire business and is still investing in what he correctly identified as a shrinking market.
We are not.
To Mr. Jensen's main point, that the restructurings beginning in the 1980s -- and continuing to this day -- have resulted in stronger, more agile companies, we again agree wholeheartedly.
We launched a restructuring program in 1987 that focused GenCorp on three strategic businesses -- automotive, aerospace and polymer products -- and shed other assets, including tires, along the way.
We believed at the time that these businesses were the right ones for GenCorp, given our technological capabilities and the growth potential of our major markets.
And while the restructuring efforts continue, I can report that we are realizing those gains that Mr. Jensen suggests.
Since 1987, we have increased productivity, reduced operating costs in our core businesses and moved toward a more customer-driven organization.
Research and development spending by GenCorp ($212 million spent since 1987) has concentrated on core processes and technologies that will maintain our competitive edge around the world.
