Hudson General Corp. said a state jury in New York City found against the company and awarded the plaintiff $21.4 million in a civil lawsuit for personal injuries.
The Great Neck, N.Y., company called the award to Joseph Sladick "improper and grossly excessive," and said it intends to challenge the amount next month in court.
The plaintiff's attorney was unavailable for comment.
The negligence suit arose from a collision about five years ago between two vehicles at John F. Kennedy Airport, where Hudson General provides various services to airlines.
Mr. Sladick, a former airline employee, lost a leg in the collision.
Hudson General said $19.2 million of the jury's award is covered by insurance.
