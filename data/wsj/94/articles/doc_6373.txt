Dofasco Inc. said it plans to make a secondary public offering in Canada of all the shares of wholly owned Prudential Steel Ltd.
Dofasco is a Hamilton steelmaker that has been restructuring its operations to concentrate on flat-rolled steels.
Prudential specializes in tubular products for the oil and gas industry.
Prudential is based in Calgary, Alberta, and employs about 400 people.
A Dofasco spokesman said Prudential is profitable, but he declined to provide further details before a final prospectus is issued.
