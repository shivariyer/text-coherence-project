Belgian utility and engineering company Tractebel SA appears poised to acquire an additional 50% stake in Distrigaz, a gas-distribution monopoly.
The Belgian government Friday took the long-awaited decision to privatize the state holding concern Societe Nationale d'Investissement, whose crown jewel is a 50% stake in Distrigaz, officially known as Societe de Distribution de Gaz.
Societe Nationale has mostly minority holdings in dozens of Belgian companies, and the sale is expected to raise around 20 billion Belgian francs (about $555 million).
But while the Finance Ministry is privatizing Distrigaz, which supplies natural gas to Belgium's industrial users, at the same time it said it plans to "reinforce the role of public authorities" in regulating the Belgian energy market.
Government officials declined to elaborate, but the declaration underlines Belgian opposition to plans to liberalize protected energy markets in the 12-nation European Union.
Tractebel, an indirect subsidiary of France's Cie. Financiere de Suez, already owns 33% of Distrigaz, so the expected transaction would boost its stake to 83%.
The government, however, said it would retain a "golden share" in Distrigaz, which it said would give it the right to veto any changes in Distrigaz's ownership and any company decisions that contradict "government energy policy" or the "general interest."
