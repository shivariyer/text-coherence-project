New Jersey authorities said they are seeking to ban stockbroker F.N. Wolf & Co. of New York, a subsidiary of Wolf Financial Group Inc., for allegedly selling unregistered securities.
The state's attorney general, consumer affairs director and Bureau of Securities also said they are seeking unspecified civil monetary penalties for alleged violation of New Jersey securities laws.
F.N. Wolf had no immediate comment.
The action is the latest trouble for Wolf.
In December, a National Association of Securities Dealers regional committee recommended a $2.2 million fine against the brokerage firm for alleged securities violations.
The action concerned the same stock for which New Jersey authorities brought their complaint, Treats International Enterprises Inc., a Canadian food company.
Last September, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Wolf of charging excessive markups on News Communications Inc. stock.
Earlier, the SEC charged Wolf with using misleading sales tactics to promote shares of Treats International.
The New Jersey complaint also charges Franklin N. Wolf, the brokerage firm's chairman, and James H. Petrantis, its chief financial officer, with engaging in unlawful sale of unregistered securities.
The complaint also charges that the brokerage firm and Messrs. Wolf and Petrantis are repeat violators of securities laws and are not qualified to be in the securities business in New Jersey.
Mr. Petrantis, in addition, was charged with failing to comply with an order from the bureau and with obstructing a bureau investigation.
The complaint alleges that F.N. Wolf sold 22 New Jersey residents 27,500 shares in Treats International, a stock that was not registered in the state.
They paid $10.50 to $12.75 a share for the stock, which now sells for about $1.
