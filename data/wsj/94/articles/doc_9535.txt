While U.S. airlines still face problems over the next several years, credit ratings for the industry overall have probably bottomed out, according to a new report by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
Moody's said that despite improved profits, it will take much of the rest of the decade for airline ratings to regain the previous cyclical peak of Baa-2 in the late 1980s.
The current industry average is Ba-2.
The industry's credit profile will continue to be hurt by declining growth in domestic traffic and weakness in overseas economies, Moody's said.
Other problems, according to the rating agency, include labor strife and "short-haul" flights, where major airlines are struggling against low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines.
But Moody's also sees positive signs in industry cost-cutting efforts, cutbacks in aircraft deliveries and firmer prices.
