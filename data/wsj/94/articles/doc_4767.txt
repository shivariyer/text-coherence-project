Big U.S. corporations are expected today to announce a business coalition organized to lobby on Capitol Hill for passage of the world trade agreement reached under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Texas Instruments Inc.'s chief executive officer, Jerry Junkins, is to head the coalition, which is bringing together such powerful business lobbying groups as the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Roundtable and the Emergency Committee for American Trade.
Companies in the coalition, called the Alliance for GATT Now, include heavyweights such as Abbott Laboratories, American Express Co. and International Business Machines Corp.
The group has hired Edelman Public Relations Worldwide to promote their effort.
Unlike the torrent of opposition arrayed against the North American Free Trade Agreement, the GATT accord isn't expected to generate such an outcry.
With an early showcasing of the pro-GATT coalition, the Clinton administration can tout business support in pushing for congressional approval by summer.
