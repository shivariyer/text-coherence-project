Adac Laboratories Inc., Milpitas, Calif., warned that new orders for its nuclear-medicine imaging equipment are slowing in the U.S. and Europe and could result in lower revenue for the fiscal third quarter ending July 1.
In the year-earlier quarter, Adac earned $4.5 million, or 28 cents a share, on revenue of $29.7 million.
The second quarter, which ends April 2, won't be affected by the order slowdown, the company said.
A spokesman said so far, the second quarter is on target with the company's internal goals, but wouldn't elaborate.
In a statement, Adac Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Stanley D. Czerwinski said Adac is "still uncertain as to whether this represents a trend or is a temporary condition."
