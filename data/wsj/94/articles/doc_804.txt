Flow International Corp. said it hasn't decided how to proceed following the Department of Justice's decision Wednesday to oppose Flow's proposed acquisition of the Waterjet Cutting Systems division of Ingersoll-Rand Co.
The department said it opposed the combination of the companies because it would create "a single dominant firm with almost 90% of all waterjet-pump sales in the United States."
Flow says the department's reasons are without merit.
Flow announced the acquisition in November, saying it would diversify and strengthen its materials-separation division.
Details weren't disclosed.
