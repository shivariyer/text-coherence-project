IRG Technologies Inc., Carrollton, Texas, said its bank lenders, Compass Bank and National Bank of Canada, agreed to amend and extend its credit facility.
The amended agreement extends the maturity date of the facility to June 1, from March 1, and allows the company to borrow as much as $25 million.
However, IRG Technologies must get its lenders' consent before drawing more than $20 million.
Last week, the computer-products distributor announced the resignation of Ernst & Young as its auditor and had said the line of credit expired March 1 because of disagreements over the terms of an extension.
As part of the pact to extend the facility, the company said it agreed to engage a new auditor by April 15.
The company said that as of Friday, about $19.6 million was available for borrowing, $17.6 million of which was outstanding on that date.
The company is negotiating with other lenders regarding a facility to replace its extended line of credit.
