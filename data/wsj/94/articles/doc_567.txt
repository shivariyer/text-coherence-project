Skoda Pilsen AS, a giant of Czech industry, became the first company from the former Eastern bloc to make a 100% acquisition of an Eastern German company, Germany's Treuhandanstalt said.
The Czech company signed a contract with the Treuhand privatization agency to buy Umformtechnik Erfurt GmbH, a large maker of hydraulic presses for automobile-body parts.
The final hurdle for the venture's financing came late Thursday when Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus telephoned the governor of the state of Thuringia, where UTE is based, a Treuhand spokesman said.
Premier Klaus promised the Czech Republic would provide financial guarantees for a loan to Skoda from a consortium of banks, the spokesman said.
Before providing the financing, the bank consortium demanded written backing for the loan.
Mr. Klaus said a letter with written guarantees is under way, the spokesman said.
Other terms weren't disclosed.
Officials at UTE's headquarters in the eastern German city of Erfurt weren't available for comment.
During the East German Communist era, UTE ranked as one of the nation's major hard-currency earners.
Its customers have included many of Western Europe's major auto makers.
Skoda Pilsen, a heavy-engineering group, agreed to invest at UTE's Erfurt plants and save at least 1,000 of the existing 1,645 jobs, the Treuhand said.
Skoda Pilsen isn't related to the Skoda Automobilova AS, the Czech auto maker that is a unit of Germany's Volkswagen AG.
UTE already has shed thousands of workers and spun off noncore operations.
As early as 1991, it diminished its dependence on markets in the former Soviet Union by acquiring a 51% stake in an Essen-based joint marketing company called Krupp Umformtechnik GmbH, giving UTE a broader foothold in Western markets.
