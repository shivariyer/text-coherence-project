Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its ratings on Kmart Corp.'s $6.7 billion of debt for the second time in 12 months, saying competition is hampering the company despite its renovation efforts.
Kmart's new-model stores, with wider aisles and upgraded merchandise, don't have the firepower to improve the company's market share and earnings quickly, Moody's said.
Such nimble competitors as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target stores, are pressuring Kmart, "despite substantial efforts by management," the ratings service said.
Moody's said the nation's No. 2 retailer also faces increased competition from J.C. Penney Co. and Sears, Roebuck & Co., which "undoubtedly took market share from the discounters in 1993."
As a result, "It will be more challenging for Kmart to increase sales, earnings and cash flow," Moody's said.
Moody's lowered Kmart's senior unsecured debt and medium-term notes to single-A-3 from single-A-2; its industrial development bonds to single-A-3 and Baa1 from single-A-2 and single-A-3; its lease certificates to Baa1 from single-A-3; its preferred stock to Baa1 from single-A-3; and its commercial paper to prime-2 from prime-1.
The company's $400 million shelf registration was lowered to single-A-3 from single-A-2.
In Troy, Mich., a Kmart spokesman, who said the company is "disappointed" by the downgrade, said he doesn't expect Kmart will need to issue debt to pay for its half-finished, $3.5 billion renovation plan.
Richard Mercier of Moody's said that will depend on the company's ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow.
"The key is whether they can execute effectively," he said.
Moody's also noted that Kmart isn't the only company scrambling to do better.
"All retailers are striving to reduce costs and increase inventory turnover -- key issues for an improvement of Kmart returns."
This will make it "difficult for Kmart to improve its cost structure and inventory turnover vis-a-vis its competitors," Moody's said.
