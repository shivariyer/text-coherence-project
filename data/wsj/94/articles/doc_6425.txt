Sales of imported cars, trucks and buses in Japan jumped 34% in January to 12,156 units from a year earlier, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association reported.
A spokesman for the association said the sales figure for January was the largest ever for imported cars.
By origin, sales of vehicles from every major exporter except France increased.
He attributed the sharp year-on-year increase mostly to price cuts by many makers, reflecting the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and other currencies.
The introduction of new models for 1994 also contributed to the results.
Sales of cars made by overseas subsidiaries of Japanese auto makers fell 42% to 1,056 units.
Cars made by Chrysler Corp. showed a particularly steep increase helped by Jeep Cherokee sales.
Sales of Germany's Mercedes-Benz cars rose 52% to 1,914 units, following the introduction in October of the C Class entry model.
