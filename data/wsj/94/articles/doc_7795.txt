Dow Jones & Co. said it will provide financial news over the Internet by mid-1994.
The service, to be called DowVision on the Internet, will include the full text of The Wall Street Journal, and same-day text of the New York Times News Service, the Dow Jones News Service, Dow Jones International News Service and press-release services.
Users of the Internet, the global network linking thousands of computer networks, will be able to receive the financial news using software that helps people navigate and search the Internet.
Dow Jones said it will charge a flat monthly fee, still to be determined.
Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, community newspapers and other publications, newswires and electronic-data services.
