Swedish venture-capital company Atle Foervaltnings AB said it agreed in principle with IBM Svenska AB, the Swedish subsidiary of International Business Machines Corp., to acquire a 65% stake in Jaerfaella Industry Competence Center AB.
Terms weren't disclosed.
IBM Svenska will retain the remaining 35% stake in Jaerfaella ICC, a manufacturer of computer-related printers, said Atle.
Jaerfaella ICC's sales are expected to total about one billion kronor ($127.4 million) in 1994, Atle said.
