Banner Aerospace Inc., saying it wants to focus on its core businesses, put its aircraft sales and aircraft electronic systems units on the block.
Banner decided to sell its Austin Jet Corp. and AJ Aerospace Inc. subsidiaries.
Austin Jet sells corporate aircraft; AJ Aerospace provides avionics, or electronic systems, installations and service for business and commercial aircraft.
Both are based in Austin, Texas.
In the 10 months ended Jan. 31, Austin had $13.2 million in sales and AJ had $1.3 million.
Banner, based in Washington, D.C., had about $200 million in sales in that period.
Banner said the move will allow it to concentrate on supplying rotables and aircraft hardware to the air transport industry.
Rotables are plane parts that can be plugged in or pulled out easily, such as navigation systems and fuel pumps.
