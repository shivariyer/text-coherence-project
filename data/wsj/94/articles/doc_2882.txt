Sithe Energies Inc. filed suit in New York Supreme Court here, seeking to stop Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.'s attempts to rework certain power-supply agreements.
Sithe, an independent power producer, holds controlling interests in four limited partnerships that sell 270 megawatts of electricity to Niagara Mohawk.
According to the lawsuit, Niagara Mohawk sent letters to the four limited partnerships, demanding certain financial assurances of future performance.
If no agreements are reached, the letter contends, Niagara Mohawk will terminate the power contracts.
The tussle between Sithe and Niagara Mohawk stems from state-mandated power contracts signed between utilities and independent power producers in the mid- and late-1980s.
Since then, however, energy prices have plummeted and demand for new power has ebbed, leaving utilities throughout the state with expensive contracts for power they essentially don't need.
Niagara Mohawk acknowledged that it had sent similar letters to other independent power producers in its service territory.
In addition, the utility said it had been sued by at least two other companies that received the letter.
The long-term agreements at issue call for higher payments in the early years of the contract that cover the utilities "avoided cost" from not building additional plants.
Any "overpayments" are adjusted for later in the contract.
Steven Burton, general counsel for Sithe, said the letters were a "heavyhanded attempt to force us to renegotiate power agreements."
The suit seeks a declaration that Niagara Mohawk's letters have no merit since the existing contract is valid.
Kerry Burns, a Niagara Mohawk spokeswoman, said the utility needs guarantees that overpayments, which it estimates at more than $1.5 billion, will indeed be recovered, as called for under the long-term agreements.
