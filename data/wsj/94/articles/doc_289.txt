Furr's/Bishop's Inc. said it would attempt to restructure its debts to stem mounting losses, avoid default on certain debt covenants and respond to its auditor's questions about its continuing viability.
The restaurant chain said it would ask certain debtholders to convert about $125 million aggregate amount of debt into a new class of Furr's common stock.
They include holders of 11% senior secured notes of the company's Cafeteria Operators L.P. unit; holders of the 9% note of its Cavalcade Foods Inc. unit; and General Electric Pension Trust, which won a $5.4 million arbitration award against the company last year.
The company also said it would ask its board, creditors and stockholders to approve refinancing all or part of its remaining debt, and reclassification of its outstanding class A and class B common stock and series A $9 convertible preferred stock into the new common stock on a share-for-share basis.
Furr's, with about 11.3 million common shares outstanding, said the plan would dilute the holdings of current shareholders by significantly increasing the number of its common shares outstanding.
It would also reduce liabilities, interest expense and principal payment oblibations, while making funds available for capital needs, the company said.
Furr's expects to begin negotiations with creditors soon.
Separately, the company said it had a fourth-quarter net loss of $160.7 million, or $14.35 a share, after a $135.5 million write-off of goodwill resulting from the company's 1986 leveraged buyout, and $13.3 million in restructuring charges.
In the year-earlier period, the company reported a net loss of $1.2 million, or 27 cents a share.
Per-share results for both periods reflected preferred dividend requirements.
Revenue fell 17%, to $58.4 million from $70.1 million.
