Automatic Data Processing Inc. named Arthur F. Weinbach, president and chief operating officer of the data-processing company.
As chief operating officer, Mr. Weinbach, 50 years old, succeeds Josh S. Weston, 65, who will remain chairman and chief executive.
The position of president has been vacant since 1989, when former President William J. Turner left the company to join leveraged buyout concern Forstmann Little & Co.
Mr. Weinbach has been executive vice president of ADP since 1992 and will remain a director of the company.
He will focus primarily on operating issues.
Mr. Weston, who will concentrate on strategic opportunities, said in an interview he has no plans to retire, noting that ADP has no compulsory retirement policy.
He became president and chief executive in 1982, when former Chief Executive Frank Lautenberg was elected to the U.S. Senate.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, ADP closed at $52.625, down 12.5 cents.
