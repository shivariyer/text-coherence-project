A Venzuelen judge charged 83 of Venezuela's top bankers and businessmen with fraud, criminal association or other crimes stemming from the collapse of Banco Latino, the country's second biggest bank.
Those charged include Gustavo Gomez Lopez, who resigned last December as chairman of Banco Latino, and the country's top banking regulator, Bank Superintendent Roger Urbina.
Also charged was Ricardo Cisneros, a Banco Latino director and owner of one of Venezuela's biggest business groups, Organization Diego Cisneros.
Many of the suspects, including Messrs. Gomez Lopez and Cisneros, already are abroad.
Mr. Gomez Lopez was charged with unlawful appropriation, fraud and criminal association.
Also facing those charges were Giacomo Leon, Banco Latino's president and Mr. Gomez Lopez's successor as chairman; Siro Febres Cordero, the bank's general counsel; and half a dozen members of the bank's board.
Mr. Cisneros and others were charged with publishing false financial statements.
Mr. Urbina was charged with covering up crimes.
