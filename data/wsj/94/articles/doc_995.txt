A federal judge in South Carolina who found a "substantial likelihood" that General Motors Corp. engaged in perjury was himself criticized by an appellate court which struck the controversial remarks.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found U.S. District Judge G. Ross Anderson Jr.'s criticism "improper" because it came in an order last month the judge wrote to remove himself from the case.
Judge Anderson recused himself from a civil case involving GM's 1973-87 pickup trucks with side-mounted gasoline tanks, after GM argued he was biased against the company.
In removing himself from the case, Judge Anderson wrote that there was a "substantial likelihood" GM engaged in "perjury and the systematic destruction of documents."
"It was improper to make new findings of fact and conclusions of law," the appellate court ruled, since Judge Anderson had already determined that based on his own actions his "fairness and impartiality" could reasonably be questioned.
The appellate court ruled that the case should be reviewed by a new judge "with a clear mind and a clean slate."
GM could not be reached for comment last night.
