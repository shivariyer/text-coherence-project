Lifetime Products Inc., a struggling marketer of windshield wipers, said its board approved a recapitalization plan that includes the resignation of most of the company's directors and management.
Under the plan, the board named Michael D. Herman, who is leading the recapitalization effort, chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr. Herman, currently president of closely held Teleconcepts International Inc. in Coral Springs, Fla., succeeds Lifetime chief executive Jennifer Runyeon and Charles C. Fichtner, the company's chairman.
No executives at Lifetime's headquarters here could be reached for comment.
A statement by the company said Mr. Herman plans to exchange outstanding warrants and secured and unsecured notes for newly issued shares of Lifetime common stock.
Once the transactions are complete, Mr. Herman will own 21% of the 5.3 million shares outstanding once the recapitalization plan is complete.
The statement said the board expects to propose a name change and a 1-for-3 reverse stock split at the company's annual meeting, scheduled for May or June.
Lifetime also said it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter of 1993 "comparable" to the $379,000 loss it posted for the third quarter of 1993.
Further financial details weren't disclosed.
