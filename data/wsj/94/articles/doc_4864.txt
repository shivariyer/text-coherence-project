Marion Merrell Dow Inc. and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. said they agreed to "co-promote" two products in the U.S.
The arrangement is essentially a marketing partnership.
Marion Merrell will help sell Sandoz's Lescol cholesterol-lowering agent, which received marketing clearance from the Food and Drug Administration in December.
Sandoz, conversely, will sell Marion Merrell's Sabril anti-epilepsy drug in the U.S.; Marion Merrell plans to ask the FDA for U.S. marketing approval shortly.
Marion Merrell currently sells Sabril in about 31 countries.
The co-promotion arrangement will last six years from the launch of each product.
Financial terms weren't disclosed.
The co-promotion arrangement will allow Sandoz to leverage off Marion Merrell's strength in the cardiovascular drug marketplace, a Marion spokesman said, and gives the U.S. company access to Sandoz's strong position in the field of neurological medicines.
Sandoz Pharmaceuticals in East Hanover, N.J., is a unit of Switzerland's Sandoz AG.
Marion Merrell Dow is 72%-owned by Dow Chemical Co.
