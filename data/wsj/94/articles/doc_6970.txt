So why did Bill Clinton let Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams into the United States?
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd spoke severely about the decision yesterday.
Northern Ireland is England's most neuralgic problem, so it's more than a little difficult to see how Mr. Clinton justifies picking at that sore and causing the Brits problems they didn't ask for.
Perhaps Pat Moynihan's support for admitting Mr. Adams and his criticism of the Clinton health plan has a little to do with it.
