Your Jan. 26 page-one article describing the progress of Ghana mentions as its problems a horrendous infrastructure, underfunded schools and malaria.
Later, "rigid state control" and "bureaucratic command" are identified as its underlying problems.
So often it is the nameless, faceless bureaucrats who receive the blame for a nation's ills.
In the case of malaria, however, we can identify and name the bureaucrat, William Ruckelshaus, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator in the 1970s.
In 1972, two years after he had declared DDT as safe, Mr. Ruckelshaus banned the use of DDT, which had saved millions of lives between 1948 and 1963, primarily by its effects on malaria, and secondarily by its effects on other diseases and agricultural pests.
None of the charges against DDT -- namely, as an agent of widespread death among some bird populations, as a nondegradable material, or as an agent of human carcinogenicity -- has ever been substantiated.
And years later, Mr. Ruckelshaus "admitted that `decisions by the government involving the use of toxic substances are political. . . .
In the case of pesticides, the power to make this judgment has been delegated to the administrator of EPA.'"
The tragedy of DDT involves the millions who perish because of diseases and famine that it could safely and effectively fight.
The tragedy also involves the insidious consequences of equating superstition and pragmatism with truth.
As the people of Ghana bear witness.
