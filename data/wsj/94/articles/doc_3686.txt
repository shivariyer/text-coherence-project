All American Semiconductor Inc. expects to report that 1993 earnings more than doubled from 1992 as sales rose about 38%, Bruce Goldberg, executive vice president, said.
The Miami distributor of electronic parts estimates that 1993 net totaled between $1.6 million and $1.7 million, or about 17 cents to 18 cents a share.
That compares with 1992 profit of $756,000, or 12 cents a share.
The number of average shares outstanding was almost 9.2 million in 1993, compared with 6.5 million in 1992.
Sales in 1993, Mr. Goldberg said, jumped to about $67.5 million from $49 million a year earlier.
The company sees net for 1993's fourth quarter rising to between $390,000 and $430,000, or three cents to four cents a share, from year-ago net of $36,000, or one cent a share.
