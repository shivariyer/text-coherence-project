A limited partnership that financed early research and product development at Storage Technology Corp. filed a lawsuit in a state court, alleging breach of a 1991 settlement and seeking damages.
The partnership, formerly Storage Technology Partners II, raised some $50 million in 1981 to finance research.
It settled claims to the work in 1991, but now says Storage Technology is using the basic technology, violating the agreement.
The suit, filed in Boulder County District Court, claims software and other technology rights and seeks damages of more than $1.4 billion.
A spokesman for Storage Technology, Louisville, Colo., said the suit is without merit.
"There is no possibility that our business could be affected in any way by the patent claims involving STP II," the spokesman said.
All patents claimed by STP II are fully cross-licensed, he said.
The partnership is now called Stuff Technology Partners II, and its managing general partner is Optical Technology Corp. of Denver.
Separately, Storage Technology reported fourth-quarter net income of $6.3 million, or 8 cents a share, after an acquisition-related pretax charge of $4.9 million, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $10 million, or 24 cents a share.
Fourth-quarter revenue fell to $400.2 million, compared with $421.3 million in the year-earlier period.
The results were well above analysts' forecasts of a loss of 5 cents a share.
However, Storage Technology said it would report a loss in the first quarter, followed by improvement in the second quarter.
The earnings were announced yesterday after the end of trading.
Storage Technology shares closed at $34.125, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
