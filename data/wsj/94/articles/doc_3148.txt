Compaq Computer Corp. today is expected to announce five new notebook computers to replace its two-year-old line of high-end portables.
The Houston company's new LTE Elite line replaces an LTE Lite family that has in the past two years grown to become Compaq's portable flagship.
Sharon Francia, a portable-product manager at the company, said Compaq's Lite family accounted for half of all the company's notebook shipments in North America last year.
The new machines, priced from $3,299 to $6,500, include updated networking features, added memory, and more powerful processors.
The total weight of the machines is only about 6.8 pounds, thanks in part to Compaq's elimination of the bulky AC adapter box that accompanies most notebook computers.
In the new machines, the electricity adapter, which charges the computer's battery, is integrated into the product.
Separately, Compaq introduced an addition to its ProSignia family of entry-level computer "servers."
The ProSignia VS, priced as low as some desktop computers at $1,730 and up, is designed to coordinate the work of groups of personal computers at small businesses or branch offices.
