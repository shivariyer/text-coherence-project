I read with interest your article about Craftmade International (Heard in Texas, Jan. 5).
I was CEO, founder and 85%-owner of DMI Products {which was bought by Craftmade in 1991}.
DMI enjoyed very rapid growth, causing it to be named to the "Inc.
Magazine 500" list of America's fastest-growing companies in 1988.
(The company missed in 1989 by just a few percentage points.)
Unfortunately, our rapid growth and the crash of Texas American Bank in 1989 created the cash-flow crisis that every CEO dreads.
Although we were performing on our line of credit, the feds {who took over Texas American Bank} forced our loan to be called.
Craftmade became our saviour.
Contrary to your article, our only "shortcoming" was a lack of cash to continue our growth.
We needed a lot of cash to import for our largest customer, Pier 1.
We were Pier 1's largest lamp supplier, selling more than $3 million a year.
Bombay was not a customer of DMI's at the time of the merger in 1990, but they wanted to be.
We simply couldn't handle them with our banking problems.
Unfortunately, Craftmade lost the bulk of Pier 1's business early on because of quality and delivery problems.
(Thus the $200,000 loss that you referred to in the article.)
Bombay was waiting in the wings and Craftmade did a great job in helping them develop their lamp program.
Pier 1 seems to be on the way back now as a large lighting customer for Craftmade.
