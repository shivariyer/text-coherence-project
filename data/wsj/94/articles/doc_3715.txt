National Intergroup Inc. proposed to pay $81.3 million in notes to acquire the 19.5% stake in FoxMeyer Corp. that the Dallas retail holding company doesn't already own.
FoxMeyer is a Dallas-based pharmaceutical distributor with annual sales of about $5.1 billion.
Under the proposal, each FoxMeyer shareholder, other than National Intergroup, would receive $14.75 principal amount of 8.25% senior notes due 2004, to be issued by a new National Intergroup unit.
FoxMeyer has formed a committee of independent directors to evaluate the proposal.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, FoxMeyer shares rose 37.5 cents to $13.875, while National Intergroup gained 50 cents to $16.25.
A National Intergroup spokesman said the company wants to acquire the remaining stake because it believes FoxMeyer's stock is undervalued.
In addition, the move would eliminate the costs of running a separate publicly traded company.
