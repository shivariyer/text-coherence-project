Deborah Gore Dean, a top federal Reagan administration housing official, was sentenced to 21 months in prison on 12 counts of corruption, bribery and perjury.
Ms. Dean, who was executive assistant to former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce, also was fined $5,600 by federal District Court Judge Thomas Hogan in Washington.
Independent Counsel Arlin Adams, who prosecuted Ms. Dean, said "This is not simply yesterday's scandal.
Our nation has paid, and continues to pay, a substantial price for this corruption of HUD.
Dean, like other former HUD appointees we have convicted, took a HUD program designed to aid low-income families, and instead manipulated it to benefit her family, her friends, and herself."
So far, 12 convictions have resulted from the probe into the HUD scandal.
Among those convicted have been a former U.S. treasurer, three assistant HUD secretaries (one of whom later became an ambassador) and two executive assistants to Mr. Pierce.
He hasn't been charged.
In a letter read by the judge during the sentencing hearing, Ms. Dean said political influence dominated a housing program designed to assist the poor.
She said a housing-rehabilitation program she worked with "was largely maintained to deliver political favors for the administration and the Congress."
