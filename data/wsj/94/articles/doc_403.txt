Union Camp Corp. said it signed a letter of intent to explore an association with Zucamor SA, a Buenos Aires corrugated container company.
The Argentine company, with annual sales of $49 million, operates a recycled linerboard mill and corrugated container plant near Buenos Aires and a corrugated container plant in San Juan Province.
Union Camp said an investment in Zucamor would complement its corrugated container plant in Chile and fit its international expansion strategy.
Union Camp is a paper, packaging and chemicals company with $3 billion in annual sales.
