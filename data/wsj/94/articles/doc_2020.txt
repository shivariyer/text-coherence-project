Roberds Inc. said three shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the company regarding its below-expected financial results for the 1993 year.
The suits, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio, allege that investors were misinformed as to the company's prospects and ask the court to certify a class-action suit consisting of investors who bought shares from the initial public offering Nov. 16, 1993, through Feb. 28, 1994.
In a statement, the furniture and appliance retailer said it disagreed with the allegations and intends to "defend the suits vigorously."
Roberds reported pro forma net income of $7.9 million, or 76 cents a share, for 1993 on sales of $217 million.
Some analysts had estimated earnings as high as $1 a share.
The suit also names as defendants Kidder, Peabody & Co. and Raymond James & Associates Inc., who acted as managers of the initial public offering.
Kidder, Peabody declined comment, while Raymond James & Associates officials could not be reached.
