For the first time in a decade Ford Motor Co. will ship about 3,000 Mustang muscle cars to Japan this year, as part of a broader strategy to boost profits by sharing more products and technology among its operations world-wide.
During a news conference in advance of the Chicago Auto Show, Ford Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alexander Trotman said Ford's long-term goal is to earn a 5% return on revenue, or an 8% to 10% return on assets -- roughly $5 billion a year on Ford's current sales.
To do that, Mr. Trotman said Ford will pursue a variety of initiatives to more closely link its operations world-wide.
As an example, Mr. Trotman cited Ford's new Mercury Mystique, which was officially unveiled yesterday.
The Mystique and its Ford twin, the Contour, are sedans that were largely engineered by Ford of Europe, and will be manufactured in Europe, the U.S. and Mexico.
Ford will have capacity to build 300,000 Contours and Mystiques for the North American market.
