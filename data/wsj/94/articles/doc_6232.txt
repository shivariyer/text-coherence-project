The chairman of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro said he was temporarily stepping aside after giving a statement to prosecutors investigating corruption in his hometown.
Giampiero Cantoni, in a statement issued by BNL, said the matter had nothing to do with the bank, one of Italy's largest.
His deputy, Rodolfo Rinaldi, will take charge in his absence.
Mr. Cantoni said he had volunteered information to Milan prosecutors about "urban affairs" that involved administrators and businessman in Segrate, a small community near the city.
Prosecutors for the past year have been probing kickbacks by builders to local officials in exchange for zoning variances.
Mr. Cantoni had been brought in by the Treasury Ministry in 1989 to run the bank after the scandal broke about improper loans to Iraq by a BNL branch in Atlanta.
