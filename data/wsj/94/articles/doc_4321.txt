HomeFed Corp. said its chief executive officer, Theodore H. Sprink, resigned to pursue other business opportunities.
HomeFed, once one of the nation's biggest thrifts, failed in 1992 because of huge losses on real-estate loans.
Mr. Sprink became chief executive just before the thrift was seized by federal regulators.
He stayed on, working with the government to sell off most of HomeFed's branches and other salvageable assets.
HomeFed said it hasn't decided whether to seek a successor.
