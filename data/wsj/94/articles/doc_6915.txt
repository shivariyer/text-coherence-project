The Texas Economic Index, a weekly leading indicator, fell to 110.72 in the latest week from a revised 110.96 the prior week.
Contributing to the decline, initial unemployment claims rose sharply and Texas refinery output fell.
But the year-over-year change in the Index rose to 2.25% from 2.24%, reversing eight straight weeks of falling figures.
Note: All figures are statewide, except for the U.S. Short Leading Index, which is national, and the Consumer Confidence Index, which tracks Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas
