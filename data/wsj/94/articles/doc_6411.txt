MCI Communications Corp. said it completed the acquisition of most assets and businesses of BT North America Inc., a data-communications services company, from British Telecommunications PLC for $125 million.
The acquisition is part of a wide-ranging alliance between the two telecommunications giants, in which British Telecom will buy 20% of MCI for $4.3 billion.
MCI said the alliance is still under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe.
