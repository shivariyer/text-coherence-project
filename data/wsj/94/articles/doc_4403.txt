The Virginia Senate yesterday passed a bill that ends restrictions on interstate banking acquisitions in that state.
The measure, which already passed the House and now awaits the governor's signature, would end Virginia's participation in the so-called Southeast Compact as of July 1.
Adopted during the mid-1980s by many states in the region, the compact is a collection of reciprocal agreements permitting bank acquisitions within the Southeast but sealing off the region from takeovers by outside institutions.
Virginia isn't the only party itching to get out of the compact.
Similar legislation is pending in three other states: Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.
North Carolina voted last year to pull out, effective in 1996.
And Tennessee and Louisiana quit the agreement in earlier years.
The breakup of the compact could free up the region's banks to merge with outsiders; it would also make some Southeastern banks potential takeover targets.
The Southeast Compact was designed to prevent Southern institutions from being engulfed by larger banks outside the region.
Since its enactment, five different Southeastern banks have emerged among the nation's top 25 in size.
But now, the compact is cramping the expansion potential of such banking giants as NationsBank Corp. and First Union Corp., both based in Charlotte, N.C.
Despite passage of the Virginia legislation, which saw no opposition and isn't expected to be vetoed, banks operating in Virginia can't necessarily make unlimited acquisitions yet.
Banks with offices in other participating states may have to delay out-of-region expansion plans until those states pass interstate acquisition laws as well.
