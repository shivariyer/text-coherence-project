Two National Media Corp. shareholders filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery in Wilmington seeking to halt ValueVision International Inc.'s unsolicited bid to acquire National Media.
The suit, filed Jan. 20, alleges that the $10-a-share offer by ValueVision, a Minneapolis-based home shopping network, does not fairly value National Media, a Philadelphia infomercial marketer.
It names ValueVision, National Media and the officers and directors of National Media.
On Friday, National Media's board rejected ValueVision's $117.5 million offer, calling it inadequate.
ValueVision declined to comment.
The plaintiffs' lawyers didn't return calls for comment.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, National Media shares fell 75 cents, or 6.7%, to $10.375.
ValueVision's Class A shares finished at $12.25, unchanged in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
