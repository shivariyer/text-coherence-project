Prime Hospitality Corp., Fairfield, N.J., said real estate developer Allan V. Rose funded the full $25 million required under a settlement of the hotel company's suit to collect on the guaranty of a note.
The funds are held in escrow pending an order from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida determining Prime's exclusive right to the proceeds.
Prime reached a settlement with Mr. Rose and another developer last June that called for an affiliate of Mr. Rose to purchase the note in question for $25 million plus the cash proceeds of the sale of about 900,000 shares of Prime stock owned by Mr. Rose.
The lawsuit was filed by Prime in July 1992 when it was Prime Motor Inns Inc.
