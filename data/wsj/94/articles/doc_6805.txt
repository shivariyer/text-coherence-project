Rep. Philip Sharp, a moderate steward of the nation's energy policy for nearly two decades, will retire from Congress after this year.
The 51-year-old Indiana Democrat holds unique sway over energy issues, as both chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee's energy subcommittee and the second-ranking Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee and its energy panel.
Once a shepherd of President Carter's energy policy, by 1992 he sponsored the comprehensive law encouraging oil conservation, nuclear-plant licensing and alternative fuels.
The former political-science professor typified the idealistic young outsiders who won office in 1974 in the large Watergate class of Democrats.
The party quickly marked Rep. Sharp as a comer, but the grind of constant campaigning in a GOP-leaning district tempered his early liberalism and lowered his public profile.
Long-disappointed Republicans now see good odds to win the seat.
Mr. Sharp said he wasn't leaving out of frustration with Congress or the public's antipathy; in his House speech yesterday, he expressed pride in the institution.
"I'm tired of campaigning," he told reporters afterward.
His 12-year-old son, standing nearby, would no longer have his Nov. 4 birthday "messed up" by elections, the lawmaker added.
About three dozen House members have announced or are expected to announce their departures, nearly half of them to seek higher office.
