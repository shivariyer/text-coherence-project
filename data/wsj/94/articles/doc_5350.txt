The transportation division of Siemens AG, the German electronics giant, said it will buy the remaining shares of Duewag AG, a streetcar and electric-train maker.
Siemens will offer either a yearly payment of 22.05 marks ($12.59) a share or a lump sum of 381.50 marks a share for the remaining 2.8% of the Duewag stock not already in Siemens control, the announcement said.
