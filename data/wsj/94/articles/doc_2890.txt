Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc., operator of the Carl's Jr. restaurant chain, said its board elected William P. Foley II chairman.
Mr. Foley, 48 years old, succeeds Elizabeth Sanders, who had been named to the post on an interim basis after the ouster of company founder Carl N. Karcher.
Ms. Sanders, 48, said in December that she planned to step down in several months.
Mr. Foley, who became a director in December, led an investor group that recently became the company's largest shareholder.
He remains chairman and chief executive officer of Fidelity National Financial Inc., an Irvine, Calif., title-insurance concern.
The fast-food concern also said it filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the potential sale of as much as $75 million of securities.
Proceeds would be used mainly to finance the opening of Boston Chicken franchise stores, the company said.
The company also said it plans to seek shareholder approval for the proposed formation of a holding company, to be named CKE Restaurants Inc.
The new company would be the parent of the Carl's Jr. restaurants and the newly formed Boston Pacific Inc. subsidiary that will operate the Boston Chicken stores.
