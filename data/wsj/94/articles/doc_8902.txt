GTE Corp. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said they will begin testing interactive video services in Manassas, Va., in late 1994.
The companies said by mid-1995 they will offer 1,000 GTE customers interactive services such as home shopping and educational programming.
The services will run on a video-dialtone network that could provide more than 500 channels of digital programming.
The system, which would use GTE's fiber-optic network and AT&T computer-video servers, is still waiting for government approvals, the companies said.
GTE, Stamford, Conn., and AT&T, which is based here, said they selected the Manassas area because of a decision by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia last year.
The court declared the video-programming section of the 1984 Cable Act unconstitutional, paving the way for such service offerings from phone companies.
