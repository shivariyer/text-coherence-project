Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it confirmed the ratings on about $5 billion of Dayton Hudson Corp.'s long-term debt, citing the company's steps to improve its troubled Mervyn's unit.
In October, the ratings agency put the debt under review for possible downgrade because of continued disappointing sales at Mervyn's, despite management's efforts to bolster its performance.
Moody's also expressed concern about weak consumer spending in California, where many of Dayton Hudson's Mervyn's and Target stores are located.
Although Moody's said it expects the "weak California economy to continue to challenge" growth at both chains, it now believes the economy there will "stabilize over the near term and these businesses should benefit from an eventual economic recovery."
Moody's also expressed more confidence in Dayton Hudson's turnaround efforts at Mervyn's.
Through a "more careful focus on customer needs," Moody's said, management has begun to edit the merchandise selection, to ensure a more consistent offering of fashionable merchandise, refine advertising and boost customer service.
"These efforts should result in improved results," the ratings service said.
Dayton Hudson, based in Minneapolis, also has "significant advantages" that will help it "manage through this period of under-performance," including its owned locations, conservative financing policies, and relatively short lead times for capital-expenditure commitments, Moody's said.
Dayton Hudson's senior unsecured debt is rated single-A-3; the Prime-2 rating on its commercial paper wasn't affected.
