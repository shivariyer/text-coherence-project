Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. said state regulators directed it to refund $41 million to customers and reduce rates by $17 million a year.
The utility said it told employees that as a result of the rulings, it will conduct an internal review that could lead to shrinking the utility or other cost-cutting measures.
The company said it has frozen salaries and hiring.
