Eli Lilly & Co. tentatively agreed to acquire Sphinx Pharmaceuticals Corp. for $6 a share, a price that values the Durham, N.C., biotech concern at roughly $80 million.
Sphinx specializes in developing thousands of synthetic organic molecules.
It tests such compounds for their potential as pharmaceuticals, using proprietary high-volume screening techniques.
The company went public in early 1992 at $15 a share, but its shares had weakened to below $3, in part, analysts said, because of difficulties encountered with products it had been developing, and in part because investors have cooled to development-stage life-sciences companies.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sphinx shares nearly doubled, jumping to $5.4375 from Monday's close of $2.875.
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Eli Lilly closed at $53.25, up 75 cents.
Lilly already owns 680,000 Sphinx shares, a stake slightly over 5%, which it acquired when it entered into a research collaboration in late 1991.
The letter of intent is subject to signing of a definitive pact, as well as approval by regulators and Sphinx holders.
