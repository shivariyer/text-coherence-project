W.R. Grace & Co. said it expects to report a fourth-quarter credit of $200 million resulting from the partial reversal of a charge it had taken for asbestos litigation.
The specialty chemical and health-care company, based in Boca Raton, Fla., said it decided to post the credit after a federal appeals court agreed to rehear a decision that prompted the company to take a $300 million charge in the first place.
At that time, Grace said the charge was necessary after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the second circuit in September reversed a lower-court ruling on a "trigger" date for calculating asbestos property damage.
The appeals court ruled that insurance coverage begins when asbestoscontaining material was installed, rather than when it was discovered, as lower courts had ruled.
The appeals-court ruling led Grace to take the $300 million charge to reflect a reduction in its insurance coverage for asbestos damage claims.
