Noland Co. reported a 30% rise in fourth-quarter earnings, helped by lower levels of bad debt.
The Newport News, Va., distributor of plumbing, heating and electrical products said net income climbed to $2.7 million, or 72 cents a share, from $2 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
The latest period includes accounting changes that reduced net income by $86,000, or two cents a share.
Sales for the quarter were flat at $100.5 million.
The company said it was optimistic that the recovery in housing construction will continue to boost its results in 1994.
With sluggish sales in the first half of last year, however, the company's 1993 net income dropped 19% to $3.3 million, or 89 cents a share, from $4.1 million, or $1.11 a share, in 1992.
The 1993 figure includes accounting changes of $342,000, or nine cents a share, and a loss of $253,760, or seven cents a shares, on the sale of a company facility.
Sales for the year slipped to $402.9 million from $412.1 million.
