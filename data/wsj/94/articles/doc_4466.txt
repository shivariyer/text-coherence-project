William W. Adams, chairman of this producer of floor coverings and building products, said he plans to retire by the end of this year.
Mr. Adams, 59 years old, won't seek board re-election in April.
The board said it expects to elect George A. Lorch, Armstrong's 52-year-old president and chief executive officer, to the added post of chairman.
Mr. Adams will continue as a member of Armstrong's senior management until July 1, and for the rest of the year will serve on the company's behalf in "several important community initiatives" in Lancaster as well as in a statewide educational improvement program.
The board said another director, W. Wallace Abbott, will retire in April, reducing the number of directors to nine.
