Ford Motor Co., which is deepening its relationship with Japan's troubled Mazda Motor Corp., said it is willing to revisit the issue of building vehicles for Mazda to sell in Europe.
Ford has spare capacity at its plants in Britain, according to remarks by W. Wayne Booker, Ford's executive vice president for international operations, reported by the Financial Times.
Ford owns 25% of Mazda.
Ford and Mazda spokesmen said the companies studied a similar proposal last year, only to scrap it in March.
At the time, Ford cited deteriorating market conditions in Europe and a failure to identify a suitable joint project.
Mazda builds vehicles in Japan for Ford to sell.
The companies jointly build cars in Michigan for the U.S. market, and Mazda sells Ford-built trucks in the U.S.
Of Japan's Big Five auto makers, Mazda is the only one without a plan for European production.
