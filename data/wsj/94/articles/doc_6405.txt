The Internal Revenue Service's plans to audit municipal bond issues for possible tax law violations are far more ambitious than the 200 or so audits previously indicated by the agency.
Marcus Owens, a leader of the IRS effort to strengthen its muni enforcement program, told lawyers and finance officers recently that the agency was planning to audit up to 200 muni issues to establish a statistically valid indication of the state of voluntary compliance with tax rules governing municipal bonds.
But Mr. Owens, clarifying his comments in a subsequent interview, said the agency plans "multiple sets of 100 to 200 audits" for different categories of taxexempt bond issues.
The IRS hasn't determined the exact number of categories it will create for these audits, but Mr. Owens indicated there could easily be five or six categories entailing up to 200 audits each.
"I would not expect the audits to begin until next fiscal year due to the planning process," the IRS official said.
