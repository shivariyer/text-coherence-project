U.S. Steel Mining Co. said it will close its Maple Creek coal mine and preparation plant in Washington County, Pa., citing "severe rock conditions."
The conditions "make continued mining of coal economically infeasible," the company said, calling the problem "unforeseen and unpredictable."
The operations were idled Jan. 11, and U.S. Steel Mining expects to begin layoffs on Friday of the 500 workers affected by the move.
U.S. Steel Mining has 2,000 employees.
A spokesman said the company likely will record a charge in the fourth quarter related to the closing, though the amount has yet to be determined.
The Maple Creek operations are scheduled to close March 31.
U.S. Steel Mining is a unit of U.S. Steel Group, which in turn is owned by USX Corp.
All are based in Pittsburgh.
