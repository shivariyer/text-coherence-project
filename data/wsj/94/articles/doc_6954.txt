Aluminum Co. of America said it will use $225 million of the proceeds from its offering of 5.75% notes due 2001 to redeem all of the company's outstanding 7% debentures due 2011.
The company said the redemption at 100% will result in an extraordinary charge to first quarter 1994 earnings of $66 million, or 75 cents a share.
Alcoa posted net income of $27.6 million, or 31 cents a share, in the 1993 first quarter.
Alcoa said the $25 million that will remain from the note offering will be used for general corporate purposes.
