American Airlines and its pilots union agreed to set a specific timetable for contract talks and turn to mediation, and ultimately arbitration, if the two sides don't agree on a new contract promptly.
The move is an attempt by the two sides to avoid the year-long negotiations and messy denouement of American's contract talks with flight attendants, which culminated in a five-day strike just before Thanksgiving.
The unit of AMR Corp., which will announce fourth-quarter and year-end results today, has said the walkout would reduce AMR's fourth-quarter after-tax earnings by $160 million, and the company will report a "significant" loss for both periods.
In the nine months, the company had net income of $143 million, or $1.30 a share.
In a joint statement, American President Robert Crandall and Rich LaVoy, president of the Allied Pilots Association, said they endorsed the new negotiating strategy, which they called "Fresh Approach."
Mr. Crandall put forth the idea for the approach after APA suggested ways to improve its relationship with management.
The plans calls for negotiations limited to 60 to 90 days.
If no agreement has been reached, the company and APA would enter mediation for the same period.
If mediation doesn't work, the two sides agreed to submit to arbitration.
APA's 10,000 pilot members and its board must ratify Fresh Approach before contract talks begin.
American's pilots contract becomes amendable Aug. 31.
Under airline labor law, the contract expires but the terms stay in effect until the sides agree on a new one or until federal mediators declare an impasse.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, AMR fell 37.5 cents to $69.875.
