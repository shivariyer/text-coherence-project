Swedish household appliance group AB Electrolux said it has decided to sell as much as 100% of the shares in its Electrolux Autoliv AB unit and apply for Autoliv's listing on the Stockholm Stock Exchange before the end of June.
Autoliv is the largest European maker of safety belts, air bags and other personal safety equipment for automobiles.
In 1993, the company had pretax profit of 300 million kronor ($37.6 million) on sales of 5.3 billion kronor ($664.8 million), Electrolux said.
Electrolux decided to sell Autoliv as part of its strategy to concentrate on core operations, it said.
The group also wants to strengthen its financial position to allow further acquisitions within its core areashousehold appliances, commercial appliances, outdoor products and industrial products.
