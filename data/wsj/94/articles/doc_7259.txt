R.H. Macy & Co., providing details about its important December selling season, said that despite a slip in total sales, its profit rose almost 38%.
In a monthly court filing required while operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, Macy said it had net income of $203.3 million, up from $147.7 million in December 1992.
The New York-based retailer, which operates 111 Macy's and Bullock's department stores, among others, said the results were due largely to improvements in merchandising gross margin and continued reduction in operating expenses.
As reported, total sales for the month dropped 1.5% to $1.178 billion, compared with $1.196 billion in December 1992.
December sales in stores open more than one year -- a key retailing indicator -- were flat with the year-earlier.
Macy's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in December rose about 30% to $266.1 million, compared with $205.1 million in December 1992.
