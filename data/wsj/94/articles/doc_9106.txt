Jan. 17, 1994
Low mortgage rates sparked a wave of new home construction last year, but it will take more than that to keep the industry growing in 1994.
Housing starts grew steadily in 1993, reaching an annual rate of 1,432,000 units in November.
That was the highest level since before the 1990-91 recession.
Much of the boom was attributed to mortgage rates, which fell to 25-year lows last fall.
A Commerce Department report this week will probably show a slight increase in December housing starts to a 1,450,000-unit rate, said Robert Brusca, economist at Nikko Securities.
Attractive mortgage rates are still drawing prospective home buyers into the market, but that phenomenon has just about run its course, he said.
Mr. Brusca said the effect of very low interest rates is beginning to wear off.
"Now we're going to have to do it with the economy, with more jobs and better income growth," he said.
And the economy, which has been growing slowly but steadily, should provide some help.
Mr. Brusca said he expects housing starts in 1994 to improve slightly, to 1,500,000 units.
Additionally, the fact that building permits continue to be issued at a high rate bodes well for future construction activity, he said.
