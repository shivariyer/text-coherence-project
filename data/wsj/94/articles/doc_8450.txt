Lebenthal & Co. named James L. Gammon, a widely known municipal-bond trader, president of its new Lebenthal Asset Management Inc. investment-managing unit effective Jan. 31.
Mr. Gammon, 52 years old, was senior vice president and senior portfolio manager at Loews/CNA Holdings Inc., a unit of Loews Corp.
Despite a reputation as a competitive and successful bond trader, Mr. Gammon left in June.
He said the departure reflected Loews's declining emphasis on tax-free municipal bonds.
At his departure, he planned to join a Dallas-based mutual-fund company, but declined the offer for health reasons.
Three weeks ago, Mr. Gammon said, doctors cleared him to work.
His new assignment will involve considerably less money than the billions he managed at Loews/CNA.
"We would like to have about $400 million in assets under management by the end of the first year," Mr. Gammon said.
"And we believe, based on preliminary marketing, that we can do that."
