The California Public Employees Retirement System said that it has withdrawn its shareholder proposal that members of Boise Cascade Corp.'s board be elected to annual, rather than staggered terms in office.
The huge pension plan, known as Calpers, said that the move was prompted by improvements in Boise Cascade's stock performance and reduced net losses, but added that it remained concerned about the company and would closely watch its management.
Calpers, the largest pension plan in the U.S., has recently been flexing its investment muscles by engineering management changes at companies that aren't performing to its expectations.
