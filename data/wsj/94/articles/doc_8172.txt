Diagnostek Inc. said it expects today to report net income of about $3 million, or 12 cents a share, for its fiscal third quarter, which ended Dec. 31.
In the year-earlier period, the provider of pharmacy services earned $1.3 million, or five cents a shares, after charges.
In an interview, Bill Barron, Diagnostek's chief financial officer, said revenue was flat in the latest period at about $99.9 million.
The improvement reflects in part about $2 million in charges in the year-earlier period.
Those charges related to losses from the sale of a mutual fund investment and legal expenses linked to an aborted merger agreement with Medco Containment Services Inc.
Duke Rodriguez, chief operating officer, said the company has seen a 7% improvement in profit margins by combining the purchasing of its various units to obtain additional discounts from suppliers.
"We are using the full leverage of our company in purchasing activities," he said, adding that the company has seen a "dramatic drop" in the prices it pays for many generic drugs.
Still, company executives said much of the improvement in margins has been offset by higher operating costs related to expansion and diversification moves.
In October, Diagnostek announced the $27 million acquisition of Perform Cost Management Services Inc., a Scottsdale, Ariz., manager of prescription claims.
Also in October, the company acquired Chronitech Health Services Inc., a closely held San Francisco provider of pharmacy and other medical services to HIV and AIDS patients, for $9 million in cash and stock.
The company is also expanding its Albuquerque facility.
With cost-cutting pressures on margins in the mail-order pharmacy business, Mr. Rodriguez said Diagnostek will concentrate on providing pharmacy management services to more hospitals and managed-care providers.
