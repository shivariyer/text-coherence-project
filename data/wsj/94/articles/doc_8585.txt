Despite a day of worrying about earnings, stock prices moved higher late in the session, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to another record.
Lower-than-expected profit reports from bellwether companies, including chip maker Intel and drug manufacturer Pfizer, battered technology and pharmaceutical stocks and pushed market averages lower much of the day.
A round of buying, though, carried much of the market higher before the close.
Computer-driven program buying aided the late recovery, according to market research firm Birinyi Associates.

Other broad-based indexes were mixed, while advancers led decliners by a slim 1,144 to 983 on the Big Board.

That figure fell two cents below analysts' views.
