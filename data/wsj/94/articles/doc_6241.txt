Giant Group Ltd., a cement-making concern controlled by financier Burt Sugarman, said it hired PaineWebber Inc. as financial adviser to explore the possible sale of Giant's cement operations or other ways of increasing shareholder value.
Mr. Sugarman, who is chairman, president and chief executive officer of Giant and owns 42% of its shares, said in a news release that the company's stock price "fails to reflect the underlying value of Giant's assets, particularly our cement operations."
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Giant Group shares jumped $1 a share, or 8.8%, to close at $12.375.
Besides its Giant Cement Co. and Keystone Cement Co. units, Giant Group holds a 38% interest in Rally's Hamburgers Inc., a troubled Louisville, Ky., fast-food concern.
Last week, Mr. Sugarman resigned as chairman and chief executive of Rally's, and was succeeded by D. Randy Laney.
Gary Pechota, president of the Giant Cement and Keystone Cement units, said the cement industry was "in the early stages of a projected long-term recovery," with higher demand and better pricing in some regions.
Giant's cement operations are also involved in burning waste material for fuel.
Mr. Sugarman, who also has a television and film production company, for a time in 1987 held talks about selling Giant's cement operations as part of an effort to take Giant into several other businesses.
In the largest such diversification attempt, the executive, through Giant and an affiliate company, launched a hostile takeover battle in 1988 for Media General Inc.
The battle ended when Media General, the Richmond, Va., publishing and broadcasting concern, bought back Mr. Sugarman's shares in a transaction valued at about $100 million.
