Douglas Besharov's Feb. 9 editorial-page article -- "Working to Make Welfare a Chore" -- advocating welfare reform that would force unwed mothers to enter programs to finish high school and then work in public service jobs misses the point.
The real damage to society is not from the tax dollars paid to women who don't work, but from the chaos caused by the fatherless children we invite them to produce.
Mr. Besharov says, "A good education and real job opportunities are the best contraceptives."
Then he suggests a welfare reform that would result in an even bigger production of fatherless children.
Mr. Besharov should put himself in the place of an inner-city teenage girl who has little chance for a good education and a job.
If this girl produces a fatherless child, she is rewarded by an income, an apartment, food stamps, health care, food, education programs, job training and now even a guaranteed job.
If this girl stays childless, she gets nothing.
These girls are not victims, but are engaging in deliberate behavior, the consequences of which we reward.
Why are we upset that we are getting more of what we're paying for?
The solution is to eliminate or reduce the reward, not add to it.
