Please accept my sincere congratulations for Texas Journal.
I am a longtime subscriber to The Wall Street Journal, and am very happy to see this recognition of the fact that Texas rates this special coverage.
Now, if only you would squeeze in a bit more data on San Antonio.
After all, we're the 10th largest city in the land.
We do admit that Dallas and Houston are larger than we are, but we are the biggest city of any within a 200-mile radius, and have much to contribute to the Texas economy.
