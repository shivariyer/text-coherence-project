Strong earnings reports and continued investor confidence in cyclicals pushed issues higher, with a key index setting its seventh straight record.
Traders and analysts say fourth-quarter earnings have taken over as the driving force in the small-capitalization markets, with many of yesterday's sharpest gains and losses coming on the heels of companies' quarterly results.
The Russell 2000 Index ended the day at a seventh straight high, up 0.77, or 0.3%, at 263.37.

Analysts say the market's so-called January effect (in which small caps see a spate of tax-related selling late in the year, followed by a January rebound) has run its course.
"Earnings will now take over and be the driving force," said Greg Kuhn of Kuhn Asset Management.
Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott, said earnings reports are indeed causing many stocks to move sharply, but he pointed out that individual issues aren't having an effect on other stocks in their respective industry groups.
Overall, he said, it's a "cyclically driven market," with economically sensitive stocks in the lead.
"It's a momentumand liquidity-driven market that hasn't reached its peak yet," he said.
Mr. Peroni is encouraged by the market's late-day strength, which he said underscores investors' confidence and willingness to hold their positions.
Mr. Kuhn added that there's another factor in sustaining the rally: the shortterm interest rate.
Until the three-month Treasury bill yields 3.3%, compared with its current 2.99%, he said, small-company stocks will continue to move higher as a default investment.
"We will still see higher highs" in the small-cap market, he said.
