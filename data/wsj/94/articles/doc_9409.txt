Your Dec. 16 page-one article "Ticket to Nowhere -- Job Programs Flunk at Training but Keep Washington at Work" quoted me out of context.
It distorts the statement I submitted at the request of The Wall Street Journal.
My full statement was:
"I have taken the lead on reforming the USDA Employment and Training Program, and I believe we have been successful.
Employment and training is designed to help people get off food stamps and into the workplace and I will fight any proposals that make that more difficult for the people we're trying to help.
I have not seen details of the Administration's proposal to move the USDA program to HHS, so I cannot determine at this time whether or not it is a good idea.
If the Administration can definitively show that this change will help people and improve the Employment and Training program, then I will give it serious consideration."
The italicized passage is all that you excerpted -- and it clearly misrepresents the tenor of my remark.
On Nov. 12, 1991, I introduced the Food Stamp Employment and Training Reform Act to fix many of the problems highlighted in your article.
I agreed with the Abt Associates report on the USDA Employment and Training Program (referred to in your article) and mandated that the program be revamped.
That legislation was passed and signed into law by President Bush.
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D., Vt.)
