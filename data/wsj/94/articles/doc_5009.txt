For the $295 million it paid for the Winter Olympics, CBS Inc. bought not only television rights to the sporting events, but also the right to keep competing news organizations' TV cameras away from embattled figure skater Tonya Harding.
News event or not, CBS has exclusive access to gather all video from the official Olympic venues where practice and competition takes place.
That includes the arena where Ms. Harding and rival Nancy Kerrigan are expected to practice together this morning, an event that CBS expects to air live on "CBS This Morning."
"I hate it.
It's an awful way to do news," says Ed Turner, executive vice president of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s Cable News Network, which has several employees on site in Lillehammer, Norway, waiting for a story to break.
"It's not enterprise or smarts," he says.
"It's just money."
CNN and other television organizations may send reporters and still photographers into the official arenas, but not video cameras.
The blackout even applies to King World Productions Inc.'s syndicated newsmagazine "Inside Edition," which paid several hundred thousand dollars for a series of exclusive interviews with Ms. Harding over the next several months.
CBS's exclusivity doesn't apply to the streets of Lillehammer, or to the Olympic Village where athletes stay.
Several news organizations, including Capital Cities/ABC Inc., said they would take advantage of access to the skaters there, although CNN's Mr. Turner said the athletes are "closely protected."
An NBC News spokeswoman said the General Electric Co. unit would use still color photos taken inside the official venues, if needed.
Television organizations may also use excerpts of CBS footage after a several-hour delay, but with numerous restrictions.
