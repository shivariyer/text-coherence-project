Park Communications Inc., a television/radio-station and newspaper concern, said directors voted to seek the sale of the company.
The move reflects the recent decision by the estate of the company's founder, Roy H. Park, to dispose of an 89.6% stake in the company.
Mr. Park's wife Dorothy was named to succeed Mr. Park as chairman after his death.
Park Communications, Ithaca, N.Y., owns nine TV stations, 22 radio stations, 30 daily newspapers, 29 nondaily newspapers and 48 controlled-distribution publications.
In 1993, Park had net income of $18.8 million, or 91 cents a share, on revenue of $172 million.
