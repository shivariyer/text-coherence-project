Sparta Surgical Corp. said its Sparta Maxillofacial Products Inc. unit completed the previously announced acquisition of certain assets of the Storz oral maxillofacial plating business from a unit of American Cyanamid Co., for $1.6 million.
Sparta Surgical said $100,000 was paid at closing and the remainder is payable under an eight-year promissory note.
The assets include the oral maxillofacial plating product line, including inventory, related technology, rights to customers and open purchase orders.
The product line had sales of $2.1 million in 1993.
In conjunction with the acquisition, Sparta entered into a 10-year agreement with Davis & Geck, another unit of American Cyanamid, for research and development of an absorbable plating system technology.
