Still eager for more dirt on Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan?
Suffering Bobbitt withdrawal now that the two trials are over?
Rest assured, the instant books are on the way.
St. Martin's Press announced that it plans a quickie unauthorized bio of attacked ice skater Nancy Kerrigan.
"Dreams of Gold: The Nancy Kerrigan Story," will be available Feb. 1, before the 1994 Winter Olympic Games begin in Lillehammer, Norway.
The 192-page paperback is being written by New York sportswriters Wayne Coffey and Filip Bondy, the publisher said.
Zebra Books, a publisher mostly of romance novels, said it plans to publish both a Bobbitt book and a book about Tonya Harding, the skater whose entourage allegedly had her rival skater attacked.
Both books will be in stores by mid-February, said Walter Zacharius, chairman of Zebra.
Called "The Bobbitt Case: You Decide," Zebra's book will be nothing more than a transcript of Lorena Bobbitt's trial for the mutilation of husband John, with a hastily written foreward.
Zebra's other books is "Thin Ice: The Complete Uncensored Story of Tonya Harding, America's Bad Girl of Ice Skating."
The book is being written by two journalists who have followed the scandal, Mr. Zacharius said.
