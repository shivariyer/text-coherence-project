CBS Inc. had the highest-rated week in its history last week, as viewers in record numbers tuned in to the network's coverage of the Winter Olympics games.
CBS drew 25.9% of the nation's 94.2 million TV households for the week of Feb. 14-20.
The network's previous high was 24.7%, for Jan. 5-11, 1976, when the CBS schedule included such popular shows as "Mary Tyler Moore" and "The Waltons" -- and cable offered minimal competition.
Now that cable is a serious competitor, "to do a personal best . . . is quite extraordinary," said David Poltrack, a CBS senior vice president.
The highest-rated week at any network was Feb. 7-13, 1983, when the miniseries "Winds of War" helped draw 32.1% of households to ABC, now a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
CBS is on track to have the highest-rated Olympics coverage ever.
The highest-rated Winter games were the 1980 Lake Placid games, which drew 23.7%; the 1972 Munich games were the top-rated Summer games, attracting 24.4%.
Both aired on ABC.
CBS's ratings are 35% ahead of the network's 1992 Albertville numbers.
Through the first eight days of the current Winter games, which began Feb. 12, about 170 million people, or 70% of the U.S. population, tuned in at some point.
Of the other broadcast networks, only News Corp.'s fourth-ranked Fox has held its own, because its core audience of young adults is the least interested in the games.
From Feb. 12-20, Fox was up 4% from its season-to-date average; ABC and General Electric Co.'s NBC were down 19% and 21%, respectively.
CBS executives said the extraordinary pre-Olympics publicity helped heighten viewers' awareness of the games.
However, executives attributed CBS's success to the network's promotion of the games as a television event, not a sports event, and to the practice of telling anecdotal stories to accompany the coverage.
