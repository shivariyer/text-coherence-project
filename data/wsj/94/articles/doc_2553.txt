Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in a letter to Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, raised the possibility of limiting sugar price supports for companies that don't join a plan to help clean up the Florida Everglades.
An Interior Department official said the move was aimed at pressing several South Florida sugar growers, principally U.S. Sugar Corp., Clewiston, Fla., to accept an agreement that was struck last January between the Interior Department and Flo-Sun Inc., a West Palm Beach, Fla., sugar grower.
U.S. Sugar and several smaller growers in the region have refused to sign on.
The Agriculture Department program provides government loans, at a subsidized interest rate, to sugar farmers.
The letter appears to suggest that loans would be curtailed for U.S. Sugar and the other sugar farmers who, under a 1991 federal consent decree, were found to be violating state water quality standards.
An Agriculture department spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the letter, but said "it has been forwarded to the proper division for review."
A spokesman for U.S. Sugar expressed frustration at the letter, saying it could "prevent settlement of the Everglades situation."
