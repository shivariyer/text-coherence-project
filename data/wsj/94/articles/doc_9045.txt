Genesco Inc., in the wake of weaker-than-expected holiday sales, said it expects to report a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter.
The news helped push the company's stock down 15% in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Genesco closed at $4.375, off 75 cents a share.
In the year-earlier fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, 1993, the footwear and clothing concern had net income of $3.6 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $150.8 million.
That included a charge of $583,000, or two cents a share, for early retirement of debt.
Genesco had indicated it would post a loss for fiscal 1994.
In fiscal 1993, it reported earnings of $9.1 million, or 38 cents a share, on revenue of $539.9 million.
Genesco said the sales shortfall during the holidays resulted in deep price cuts and underutilization of the company's manufacturing capacity.
As a result, it said it is considering closing unprofitable retail stores, cutting back manufacturing capacity and reducing overhead expenses.
The size of its fourth-quarter loss will depend on those actions, the company said.
Separately, Genesco named Harry D. Garber, 64 years old, chairman of the board, effective Jan. 31.
Mr. Garber served as vice chairman of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., a unit of Equitable Cos., until last year.
He has been a Genesco director since 1976.
He succeeds William S. Wire II, 62, whose term as chairman expires Jan. 31.
Mr. Wire will remain a director and consultant to Genesco.
