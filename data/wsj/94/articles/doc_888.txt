Norway's March unemployment rate fell to 5.4% of the work force from 5.6% the month before, according to the Norwegian Labor Directorate.
However, the directorate said it was too soon and the drop was too small to be interpreted as a trend.
The number of people in state labor market employment programs rose to 3.9% of the work force, or 65,500 Norwegians, in March, compared with February, when 2.9% or the work force, or 62,200 people, were involved in such programs.
