Texas Instruments Inc. said that the Army awarded its defense systems and electronics group a $57.9 million contract to develop a thermal-imaging and fire-control system for the military's Bradley Fighting Vehicle.
The system will enable a gunner to use an automated target-tracking device to attack longer-range targets with a greater probability of a hit, the defense and electronics concern said.
Texas Instruments said its contract is part of a 41-month program to upgrade the Bradley and includes hardware and software development, the delivery of 16 prototype systems and the development of a pilot production line.
