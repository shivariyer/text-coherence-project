Teck Corp. said it agreed to purchase about 11 million shares of Cominco Ltd. and a stake in a zinc mine from a subsidiary of M.I.M. Holdings Ltd. for a total of 209 million Canadian dollars (US$155 million).
The acquisition will raise Teck's stake in Cominco, a Vancouver, British Columbia, base-metals producer, to 36% from 22%.
Teck, a Vancouver gold and base-metals concern, said it will also double its interest in the Polaris zinc mine in the Canadian Arctic to 22.5%.
M.I.M. will continue to hold 6.9 million Cominco shares, or about 8.6% of the shares outstanding.
M.I.M., an Australian mining concern, has recently been selling assets to raise cash.
Last month it said it planned to sell a minority stake in Granges Inc., a Toronto mining concern, for about C$50.8 million.
