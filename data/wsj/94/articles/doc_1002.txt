President Clinton refused to grant executive clemency to convicted spy Jonathan Pollard, after the Justice Department recommended against the clemency requests by some Jewish groups.
Attorney General Janet Reno yesterday joined the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency in recommending against clemency for Mr. Pollard, who was sentenced to life in prison in 1986 after pleading guilty to passing secrets to Israel.
The Israeli government, including a personal plea by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and the American Jewish community had campaigned for his release, arguing his sentence was too tough.
Mr. Pollard, a former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst, is eligible for parole next year.
Citing the "grave nature" of Mr. Pollard's actions, Mr. Clinton said in a statement, "the harm his actions caused to our country and the need to deter every person who might even consider such actions, warrant his continued incarceration."
