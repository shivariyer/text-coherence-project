The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 1,009 adults conducted Saturday through Tuesday by the polling organizations of Peter Hart and Robert Teeter.
The sample was drawn from 263 randomly selected geographic points in the continental U.S.
Each region was represented in proportion to its population.
Households were selected by a method that gave all telephone numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance of being included.
One adult, 18 years or older, was selected from each household by a procedure to provide the correct number of male and female respondents.
The results of the survey were minimally weighted by age, sex and, owing to the effects of the Los Angeles earthquake, by region to assure that the poll accurately reflects registered voters nationwide.
Chances are 19 of 20 that if all adults with telephones in the U.S. had been surveyed, the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 3.1 percentage points in either direction.
A limited number of questions were asked of half the sample; for these, the margin of error is 4.5 percentage points.
The margin for any subgroup would depend on the size of that group.
