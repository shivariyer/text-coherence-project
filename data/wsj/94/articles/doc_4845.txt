The company said its board will at its April 20 meeting name E.J. Mooney, currently president and chief operating officer, to serve additionally as chief executive officer.
In the chief executive post, the 52-year-old Mr. Mooney will succeed W.H. Clark, 62, who will retain the chairman's title until he retires July 1.
The company said it expects Mr. Mooney, who is dropping the chief operating officer title, to be named chairman at that time.
Mr. Clark said he "recommended the board take this action at this time, in order to ensure a smooth transition."
