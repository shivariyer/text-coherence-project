Responding to investors' complaints, the New York Stock Exchange reinstated certain program-trading statistics that it had stopped releasing publicly.
An article in Friday's Wall Street Journal about the exchange's information cutback had prompted several investors to complain, the exchange said.
Also expressing concern was U.S. Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee.
The exchange, which releases data about program trading each week, had stopped including a special breakdown of the most-active program traders during periods in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves 50 points within an hour.
This information had been useful in identifying the source of program trading during big market movements.
Yesterday , a Big Board spokesman said: "The exchange received requests for the information so we are reinstating the special profiles."
Program trading is the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks valued at $1 million or more.
Rep. Markey, citing the Journal article, wrote to Big Board Chairman William Donaldson on Friday that his subcommittee "has long been concerned about the potential for computer-assisted program-trading strategies to contribute to excessive and artificial levels of volatility" in the stock market.
He added: "The subcommittee was quite disturbed to read that the NYSE was reducing the amount of information being made available to the investing public regarding program-trading activities during periods of high market volatility."
But after being informed that the data has been reinstated, Rep. Markey commended the Big Board's "quick action" and urged that it continue "closely monitoring" program trading.
