Tambrands Inc. reported a 32% decline in fourth-quarter earnings on lower sales that resulted mainly from fluctuations in trade customer inventories in the U.S.
The maker of Tampax brand tampons said net income for the quarter fell to $21.1 million, or 55 cents a share, from $31.1 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales in the quarter declined 11%, to $146.7 million from $165.3 million.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations.
Positive trends that began in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter, Howard B. Wentz Jr., chairman, said.
"I believe we have resolved the difficulties of the first half of last year and put a solid foundation in place for 1994 and beyond," he said.
The company's U.S. market share for the second half of 1993, when Tambrands began its new marketing strategy, was more than a full point higher than in the first half, he said.
A spokesman said there has been a significant decline in the amount of inventory retailers have on hand.
He noted that although sales to the trade of Tampax tampons decreased 14% in the U.S. in both dollars and units for the fourth quarter, units of tampons purchased by consumers rose about 1.4% from the 1993 fourth quarter."
We expect our sales to much more closely match consumer purchases in 1994," the spokesman said.
For the year, net fell 48%, to $63.5 million, or $1.64 a share, from $121.4 million, or $3.06 a share.
Sales declined 11%, to $611.5 million from $684.1 million, reflecting lower volumes caused mostly by the reduction in trade inventories, weakening of European currencies and the 1992 divestitures of the Maxithins sanitary pad business in North America and the pad and diaper businesses in Brazil and Mexico.
Earnings for the year included a one-time charge of $10.3 million, or 27 cents a share, related to an accounting change for post-employment benefits.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Tambrands closed at $43.125, up 12.5 cents.
