Spiegel Inc., helped by strengthening profit margins, said fourth-quarter earnings rose 55% on an 18% increase in sales.
The catalog apparel retailer, based in Downers Grove, Ill., had net income of $55.8 million, or 53 cents a share, up from $36.1 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales climbed to $1.03 billion, from $869.1 million.
In Nasdaq Stock Market, Spiegel Class A shares jumped $1.75, or 8.9%, to $21.50.
Spiegel attributed the earnings to less discounting of its products, and to increased sales of its private-label products.
Those products are less costly to Spiegel because they're designed in-house rather than by manufacturers.
The company also said that its Eddie Bauer subsidiary continued to enjoy "consistently strong gains" in its comparable-store and catalog sales.
