ENSERCH Corp., Dallas, said it will sell $150 million of previously registered 10-year notes.
The natural-gas company said it will use part of the proceeds to purchase its Series D adjustable-rate preferred stock for $50 a share.
A spokeswoman said the company has 1.5 million shares outstanding.
Enserch said it also will use proceeds to redeem the following sinking-fund debentures: 7.5% due 1996, 7.65% due 1998, 8.95% due 1999, 8.75% due 2001 and 8.5% due 2002.
Pending board approval Feb. 8, the company said redemptions will begin in March.
