Courtaulds Textiles PLC reported a slight drop in pretax profit for 1993 as the second half of the year offset the weak performance seen in the first six months.
Courtaulds, which had reported a profit drop of 17% at the interim stage, said the gap with 1992 was narrowed by a 11% increase in second-half profit.
Pretax profit for the year was #38.8 million ($58.1 million), down 0.8% from #39.1 million a year earlier.
Sales were up 3.8%, to #923.1 million from #889.6 million.
Noel Jervis, chief executive officer, said that he expects conditions in Continental Europe to hold back 1994's financial performance but noted that "there is a continuing recovery in the U.K. and U.S. economies."
Germany, France and Spain were the hardest hit and Courtaulds described trading conditions in Europe during 1993 as "extremely tough."
