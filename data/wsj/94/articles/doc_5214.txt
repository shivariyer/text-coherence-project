Japan's Kobe Steel Ltd. and Texas Instruments Inc. signed an agreement for marketing and applications development of "clad metals" -- composites of two or more dissimilar metals -- the companies said Tuesday.
Under the agreement, Kobe Steel will be responsible for the Japanese marketing and applications development of the clad metals produced by TI's metallurgical materials division.
Demand for clad metal products is expected to increase in the automotive field, the companies said, as use of lightweight aluminum vehicles rises.
The use of aluminum clad steel allows aluminum sheet components to be welded to the steel structure of automobiles, using conventional spot-welding techniques, the companies said.
Although Kobe Steel and TI are studying production of clad metals in Japan, all materials covered by the agreement will be produced for now at a TI facility in Attleboro, Mass., the companies said.
