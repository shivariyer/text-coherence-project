This weekend the principal and superintendent of a Long Island, New York, intermediate school canceled a kids' production of "Peter Pan" because it might offend the local Shinnecock Indians.

Could animal rights activists condone a play that depicts a dog forced to work as a nanny or makes light of feeding an alarm clock to a crocodile?
The school that killed Peter Pan is now considering staging "The Wizard of Oz."
Expect protests from the vertically challenged.
