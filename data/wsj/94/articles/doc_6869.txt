The Pentagon's top lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, has emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Philip Heymann as deputy attorney general.
Mr. Heymann announced his resignation last week.
Ms. Gorelick would likely enjoy an easy confirmation process, having undergone one last year for her current position.
The 43-year-old Harvard Law School graduate has been a major player in the development of the Defense Department's policy on gays in the military, and has worked with the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission in developing an antitrust enforcement strategy concerning the consolidating defense industry.
Ms. Gorelick is author of "Destruction of Evidence," a 1989 treatise on maintaining documents and penalties for destroying evidence.
Before joining the Pentagon, Ms. Gorelick was a litigator in the Washington law firm of Miller, Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin, where she specialized in civil and criminal matters, including grand jury investigations.
The emergence of Ms. Gorelick as a leading candidate was first reported by the New York Times yesterday.
