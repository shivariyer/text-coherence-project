The manager of a hedge fund in which Hillary Rodham Clinton is an investor said former thrift owner James McDougal was never among his clients, as a group of Republican representatives asserted.
Bill Smith, president of Smith Capital Management, disputed several statements in a letter signed by 81 members of the House and sent Wednesday to the Office of Government Ethics.
The letter asked for an investigation into Mrs. Clinton's holdings in a hedge fund, Value Partners I, that is managed by Mr. Smith.
Among other things, the letter said Mr. McDougal was an investor in the fund and was in a position, with others, to inform Mrs. Clinton that the fund was selling short health-care and pharmaceutical stocks at the time she was making speeches about national health-care reform.
Health-care stock prices dropped after those speeches.
In an interview, Mr. Smith said the fund didn't hold any pharmaceutical stocks at the time of Mrs. Clinton's speeches and in fact was "long" -- or betting that prices would rise -- in the stocks of two health-maintenance organizations during the first quarter of 1993.
Mr. Smith said Mr. McDougal, the former chairman of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association, was never a client.
