R.H. Macy & Co., under pressure to produce a draft of a reorganization plan, is expected to get a two-week extension to March 23 by which it must file an outlined plan with a court-appointed mediator.
People close to the bankruptcy talks confirmed a report in Women's Wear Daily yesterday that the new date stemmed from an agreement between Macy and the court-appointed mediator Cyrus R. Vance and his law firm, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, the mediator's counsel.
Federal bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland originally had given Macy a March 8 date to file a term sheet "specifying the principal terms and conditions" of a reorganization plan.
That order also said Mr. Vance "may require" creditors and other interested parties that wish to submit a reorganization plan to also submit term sheets.
Robert Miller, an attorney with Berlack, Israels & Liberman representing Macy's bondholders committee, said he is "actively considering" proposing a term sheet on behalf of bondholders.
He added, though, the judge's order is unclear as to whether interested parties need to be asked by Mr. Vance to submit a plan, or whether they can do it voluntarily.
A spokeswoman for Federated Department Stores Inc., a Macy's creditor that wants to merge with the retailer, said it hasn't yet decided when it would file a voluntary term sheet.
