Aer Lingus unveiled the first Dublin-New York nonstop flights and a switch from Boeing Co. aircraft to Airbus Industrie planes as part of its new North Atlantic strategy.
Ireland's state-owned airline said it would lease three Airbus A-330 planes for its new trans-Atlantic services.
The new 331-seat Airbuses, to be leased from American International Group Inc.'s International Lease Finance Corp., will replace Aer Lingus's three aging Boeing 747s, which seat up to 425 passengers.
The airline posted a loss of 188 million Irish punts ($269.2 million) in the most recent full fiscal year, which ended March 31, 1993.
Analysts blamed the airline's problems on poor cost controls and an expensive stop, required by the Irish government, in the western Irish city of Shannon for all trans-Atlantic flights.
