Silicon Alleys, in effect.
In a recent article in China's official press, Yang Dakan of the State Planning Commission's Economic Research Institute predicted that the number of self-employment enterprises -- with fewer than eight employees -- will soar this year to 19 million and will employ 32 million workers, up 12% from 1993.
Sales could top $23 billion.
Most of China's cottage industries are in basic industries, but high-tech companies are multiplying, Mr. Yang wrote.
"The business has mushroomed," says Michael L.Y. Ng, deputy general manager of Legend Holdings Ltd., one of the most successful computer companies operating in China today.
Legend, a six-year-old joint venture between a Hong Kong company and Academia Sinica, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, sells its own brand of computers in China, as well as products from AST Research Inc., International Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Intel Corp.
Legend's sales in the year ended March 31, 1993, totaled 1.8 billion Hong Kong dollars ($232.2 million), producing a profit of HK$26.4 million.
The company expects profit to more than double in the current year.
Like other upstart technology companies, Legend has hired dozens of highly trained -- although inexpensive, because of China's low wage scales -- engineers to help it cook up new applications for its products.
In a marketing effort, Legend stages demonstrations at universities and even produces academic papers on the capabilities of the machines it sells.
Rivals apparently know the routine, too: Compaq Computer Corp. of the U.S. has anted up $1 million for a research center in Beijing.
The biggest competitive challenge Legend faces is the presence of state-owned computer companies, in particular Great Wall Computer Co., the biggest maker of own-brand computers in China, which Legend says wins many orders because of its ties to the government.
Although China's electronics production -- everything from light bulbs to state-made Milky Way mainframe computers -- last year reached nearly $15 billion, the state is infusing only $1.5 billion in new equipment and research during the current five-year plan, which ends in 1995.
That leaves a yawning capital gap -- and a market -- that entrepreneurs and upstart high-tech companies are rushing to fill.
China's market for personal computers has been growing at least 25% in each of the last five years, and the pace is accelerating.
In 1992, about 200,000 personal computers were sold in China; in 1993, according to a preliminary government estimate, the number was 350,000.
Officials expect demand to reach at least one million PCs by the year 2000.
Now, even more-powerful computers are catching on.
NEC Corp., the Japanese computer maker, said Feb. 10 that it's considering producing small computer workstations in China.
It hopes to conclude a feasibility study by the end of this year.
Meanwhile, smaller Chinese companies are cropping up every day, providing specialized software and applications.
Some simply dream up software for what engineers here dub hanzification-enabling personal computers to write and read Chinese characters, or hanzi.
Wang Yongmin, a 55-year-old Chinese entrepreneur, pioneered the field in the 1980s.
Casio Computer Co. of Japan last year signed a patent-transfer with Mr. Wang's company, Wangma Computers Corp., to use his hanzification system.
Digital Equipment Corp. also has an arrangement to use Wangma's software.
At Ralph Ma's company, Beijing Sun Step Electronics Technology Co., on the outskirts of Beijing, 30 recent university graduates in sweaters and jeans design, produce and market computer add-on boards that enhance the quality of the graphics a monitor can show.
Big clients include air-traffic-control offices and computer-aided design or mapping companies, and it exports some components.
Sales last year were almost $3 million.
On the back of Mr. Ma's business card are two words: "Beijing Bastards."
That's the title of a controversial movie he is marketing and a ticket, he hopes, to a multimedia future.
Mr. Ma, who also manages China's hottest rock star, Cui Jian, figures if he can just find a way to link his budding entertainment empire to his main business-designing personal computer software and enhanced-graphics boards -- his prospects are limitless.
One idea: creating software to feed movies digitally to cable-TV subscribers.
Told that huge U.S. companies are battling to do the same thing, Mr. Ma takes a pensive drag on a Marlboro, pauses and says, "Yes, we have heard of that.
We want to make full use of the industry trends."
Mr. Ma is fond of American glitz, and that's what sparked the development of his entertainment business.
He's now trying to market the critically acclaimed (though officially condemned) underground film "Beijing Bastards," which Mr. Ma descibes as a "very druggy" depiction of young, rebellious Chinese musicians.
"We want to be huge on the entertainment side, and then we will use this technology to sell what China has to the rest of the world," Mr. Ma says.
One of his software engineers, 26-year-old Wang Ling, is enthusiastic at the prospect: "Multimedia is very popular in China.
It's talked about everywhere."
