Enserch Exploration Partners Ltd. said it will suspend its quarterly cash distribution to unit-holders.
In a news release, Gary J. Junco, president and chief operating officer of the oil and natural-gas partnership's managing general partner, Enserch Exploration Inc., said continuing the cash distribution would be imprudent.
"Cash requirements for funding these distributions and for capital expenditures merited for growth have exceeded cash generation for some time," he said.
"Enserch Exploration Partners has been borrowing from Enserch Corp. to fund the cash distribution for many years.
Because Enserch owns 99.2% of the outstanding Enserch Exploration Partners units, the distribution has virtually been paid entirely to Enserch while the partnership has incurred the debt associated with paying the distribution.
It would not be prudent to further increase Enserch Exploration Partners' total debt for the purpose of continuing these distributions."
Enserch Corp., the majority owner of Enserch Exploration Partners, is an energy, engineering and construction concern.
Mr. Junco said reinstatement of the cash distribution would depend on factors that include future cash flow and capital spending requirements.
