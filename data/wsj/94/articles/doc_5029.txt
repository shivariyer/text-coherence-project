New Plan Realty Trust said it purchased a shopping center in Lancaster, Pa., and signed contracts under previously announced transactions to buy four more centers for a total value of about $31 million.
The real estate investment trust said the acquisition of the five properties with a combined retail space exceeding 710,000 square feet marks the continuation of its aggressive acquisition program.
"Our expenditures for properties in 1994 are targeted at $100 to $150 million," the company said.
New Plan Realty owns 110 properties in 18 states, including shopping centers and apartment complexes.
