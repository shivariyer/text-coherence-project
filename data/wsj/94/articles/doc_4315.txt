Premier Bancorp Inc., Baton Rouge, La., said it signed a letter of intent to acquire closely held Heritage Financial Corp., Ruston, La., and its subsidiaries for no less than $75 million in stock.
Heritage has assets of $433 million and four subsidiary banks with 18 branches in north central Louisiana, according to Premier, which has 111 branch offices around the state and assets of $4.2 billion.
Terms of the agreement call for each of the 546,074 common shares outstanding of Heritage to be converted into 7.63 shares of Premier common stock, or about 4.2 million shares, subject to adjustment so the total value of the Premier shares to be issued will be no less than $75 million.
As of Dec. 31, Premier had about 28 million common shares outstanding.
Premier said completion of the acquisition is dependent on completion of due diligence, execution of a definitive agreement, approval by both companies' boards and approval of regulatory agencies.
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Premier closed at $17.40, down 12.5 cents.
