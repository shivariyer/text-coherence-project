Texas Attorney General Dan Morales said the state has reached a settlement of a lawsuit against Instituto Bilingue Internacional and owner Ramon Pacheco that requires the school and its owner to pay $7,000 in fines and to refrain from telling customers that they will learn to speak English at his school.
The state had accused Mr. Pacheco and his school of using deceptive trade practices.
The school was supposedly set up to teach English to Spanish-speaking students at two locations in Dallas suburbs.
According to the attorney general, the school was teaching improper grammar and threatening students with deportation for falling behind in tuition payments.
The school had also incorrectly told students their diploma from the school would be recognized by colleges and universities.
