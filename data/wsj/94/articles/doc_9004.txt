Abbott Laboratories, helped by strengthening domestic sales, reported a 12% increase in fourth-quarter earnings on a 6.3% rise in sales.
The health-care-products concern said net income rose to $391.3 million, or 48 cents a share, from $348.9 million, or 42 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
The earnings gain came as sales increased to $2.23 billion from $2.10 billion.
Per-share earnings reflect a decrease in the number of shares outstanding to 823.3 million, from 836.9 million.
World-wide sales of pharmaceutical and nutritional products rose 10.7%, to $1.18 billion, the company said, while sales of hospital and laboratory products recorded a less-robust 1.7% upturn, to $1.05 billion.
The slower growth in hospital and lab products reflects the negative impact of foreign currency translations and new product introductions in the year-earlier period, a spokesman said.
Abbott also noted that domestic sales climbed 9.2% to $1.41 billion.
International sales, hurt in part by the stronger U.S. dollar as well as weakness in the European economy, rose just 1.6% to $821 million.
The latest period included net losses on foreign exchange of $10.3 million, compared with a net foreign-exchange gain of $6 million in the year-earlier period.
In a reference to Abbott's results for the year, Duane L. Burnham, chairman and chief executive, said he was "pleased by our strong performance in 1993, particularly in light of the many changes occurring in the health care industry."
He said, "In each of our four businesses-pharmaceutical, nutritional, hospital and diagnostic products-growth was driven by new product introductions and volume gains."
For the full year, Abbott had net income of $1.4 billion, or $1.69 a share, up from $1.24 billion, or $1.47 a share, in 1992.
The latest year includes a pretax gain of $70 million, while the prior year included a $215 million charge and a $272 million pretax gain.
Sales in 1993 rose 7.1%, to $8.41 billion from $7.85 billion in 1992.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Abbott rose 12.5 cents to $29.75.
