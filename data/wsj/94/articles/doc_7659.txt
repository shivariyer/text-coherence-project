Procter & Gamble Co., feeling the effects of sharp cost-cutting moves begun in mid-1993, reported a 13% increase in profit for its fiscal second quarter, despite lower dollar sales and continued difficulties in its diaper and food units.
The Cincinnati consumer-products company posted net income of $653 million, or 92 cents a share, for the period ended Dec. 31, up from $576 million, or 81 cents a share.
Several analysts said they believe P&G's stock, which recently hit a historic high of $59.875, up 20% from last January, will be trading around $70 within 12 months as cost reductions kick in.
"They've got momentum," said Joseph Kozloff, an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson who rates the stock a "buy."
In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, P&G shares were unchanged at $58.625.
Sales were $7.79 billion in the quarter, down 0.6% from $7.84 billion a year earlier.
The decrease reflected unfavorable foreign-currency effects, the divestiture of juice and pulp businesses, and a world-wide economic environment that made price increases difficult, P&G said.
However, unit volumes were strong, rising 6% as a result of price cuts and aggressive marketing.
Unit sales of laundry and cleaning products were up 9% in the U.S. P&G cut the price of liquid laundry detergents and fabric softeners last summer.
P&G had better results internationally than in the U.S. Domestic volumes rose 4%, while international volumes were up 7%.
Earnings got a boost from a cost-cutting program announced last July under which P&G is cutting 13,000 jobs and shutting about 30 plants.
P&G Chairman Edwin L. Artzt said, "Both the U.S. and international businesses showed good earnings growth, due in part to our restructuring program, which is just beginning to contribute to our earnings progress."
The results contained some blemishes, however.
P&G's $3.3 billion food and beverage business -- which includes Pringles snacks, Folgers coffee and Duncan Hines cake mixes -- had no volume growth.
P&G's $1.5 billion U.S. disposable-diaper business saw volumes plummet 10% from a year earlier.
The company played down the domestic comparison, citing the previous year's strong sales following a price cut.
However, a new round of price cuts in May followed by the September launch of premium-priced Pampers Ultra Dry Thins didn't seem to help in the quarter.
International sales, which represent two-thirds of the company's diaper sales, rose 7%.
