Choice Drug Systems Inc. said it is negotiating a settlement with the U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia to allow the company to stay in the Medicare program despite past claims problems.
Choice Drug said an internal investigation of its Florida unit identified about $1.9 million of reimbursements affected by documentation problems, such as false authorization signatures on Medicare claim forms.
In August, the company said it discovered in the internal probe that a former official signed some claims without proper authorization.
Medicare reimbursements make up about 10% to 15% of Choice Drug's business.
Choice provides pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and disposable products to health-care facilities and through mail order.
It also manages hospital pharmacies.
Frank Mandelbaum, Choice president, said he believes an agreement with the government will cost the company an undetermined amount of money, but he said he didn't know whether the amount would affect earnings.
A payment may be covered under the company's insurance policy, he said.
Mr. Mandelbaum said no senior management knew of the documentation problems and the official at the unit who was involved has been fired.
"This wasn't a case of trying to defraud the government of money," Mr. Mandelbaum said.
The former official "took a shortcut, which created a problem," he said.
Separately, Choice reported its net loss for the third quarter ended Nov. 30 narrowed to $212,594, or three cents a share, from $1.1 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 12% to $13.7 million from $12.2 million.
