Easel Corp. formed a Japanese subsidiary called Easel Japan KK.
In a news release, Easel said the Tokyo-based unit initially will focus on supporting International Business Machines Corp.'s IBM Japan unit's sales of Easel's Enterprise Workbench product.
The Japanese unit also will form relationships with other companies, especially Japanese systems-integration concerns.
The company also reached an agreement for L'Intellegence Homme Machine, based in Paris, to be its new distributor in France.
A company spokesman said its French distribution pact with ISE Frame was mutually terminated.
