We noted with interest your new foray into the "bookstore wars" on Feb. 23, with the publication of a bestseller list.
We hope that the following points help your readers more fully understand some of the more thorny issues in this ongoing battle: The 13 chains that provide you with 100% of your sample are owned by only four companies: Kmart Corp., Barnes & Noble, Crown Books Inc. and Books-A-Million.
A quick analysis of your March 2 bookseller list reveals that the "Seven Sisters" of book publishing supplied 90% of that list to these 13 chains.
Six of these top U.S. publishers are involved in cease-and-desist proceedings with the Federal Trade Commission regarding alleged discriminatory business dealings favoring chain bookstores; the FTC is reportedly investigating the seventh for the same business practices.
Since it is common knowledge that major publishers pay money to obtain favorable positions in chain bookstores for their leading titles, it seems that your list (and many other bestseller lists) serves more to perpetuate industry hyperbole than to accurately reflect the diverse and eclectic tastes of American readers.
