Nordson Corp. expects booming U.S. demand for its specialized machinery, combined with some improvement abroad, to produce sharply higher earnings for the fiscal first quarter, William P. Madar, president and chief executive, said.
American manufacturers are making "strategic investments" in modernization projects, Mr. Madar said.
"They're doing the kind of things that companies do when they expect a lengthy period of good demand for their products."
Officials of Nordson, based in Westlake, Ohio, declined to make specific earnings projections.
But Mr. Madar, in an interview, didn't quarrel with analysts' forecasts of an earnings rise of about 20% for the quarter ended Jan. 31.
Analyst estimates for quarter average 42 cents a share, up from operating earnings of $6.7 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier, on sales of $100.3 million.
The year-earlier figure excludes an extraordinary charge of 25 cents a share.
Net for the quarter was $1.9 million, or 10 cents a share.
