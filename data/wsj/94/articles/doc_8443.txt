FIRST USA Inc., Dallas, said it registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission a plan to sell five million shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock for total proceeds of about $160 million.
The issuer and processor of credit cards said it would use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, possibly including reducing debt and providing capital to subsidiaries for expansion.
Each of the new preferred shares will convert to one common share after four years, if not redeemed or converted earlier.
Separately, the company registered with the SEC a public offering of five million common shares to be sold by existing shareholders.
Merrill Lynch & Co. will be lead manager on both issues.
