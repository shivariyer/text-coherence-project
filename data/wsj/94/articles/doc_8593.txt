Apple Computer Inc. said it named James J. Buckley president of its U.S. marketing arm, Apple USA, to succeed Robert Puette, who was forced out last October.
Mr. Buckley, 43 years old, who has been with Apple for nine years and most recently ran Apple USA's higher-education division, faces daunting challenges.
Apple is suffering from a painful price war with other personal-computer makers, and its flagship Macintosh line seems to have lost some of its market appeal.
Its recently introduced personal digital assistant, the Newton MessagePad, hasn't sold as well as expected.
Apple hopes to ignite sales this summer when it unveils a new generation of personal computers containing the high-capacity PowerPC chip.
Meanwhile, Mr. Buckley must find ways to persuade customers to buy the existing Quadra line of Macintosh products, rather than await its more potent successors.
Mr. Buckley will report to Ian Diery, executive vice president and general manager of Apple's personal-computer division.
Before joining Apple, he held marketing positions at the office systems divisions of Exxon Corp. and Xerox Corp.
Mr. Puette, 52, was the victim of a housecleaning by Michael Spindler, who became chief executive officer last June after John Sculley left the company under pressure from Apple's board.
