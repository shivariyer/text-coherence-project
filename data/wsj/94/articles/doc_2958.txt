To examine how black men and women are faring in the workplace, The Wall Street Journal studied employment records of companies filing reports with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1982 through 1992.
More than 1.7 million reports were analyzed for the 11-year span.
These included reports from 38,059 companies in 1992, covering more than 42 million workers, or about a third of the civilian labor force.
Businesses with 100 or more employees must tell the EEOC yearly the number of workers they employ, breaking the figures down by race and gender and by the type of job held.
Companies with 50 or more employees and a U.S. government contract of at least $50,000 must file reports, too.
The EEOC reports cover nine job categories, ranging from officials and managers to laborers.
For this study, the Journal focused mainly on high-paying office positions -- white collar jobs, excluding clerical workers.
In addition to managers, this group includes professionals, technicians and sales workers.
