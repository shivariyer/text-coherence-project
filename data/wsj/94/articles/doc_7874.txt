Two large California thrifts, benefiting from signs of recovery in California's economy, posted healthy operating results for the fourth quarter.
Oakland-based Golden West Financial Corp., parent of World Savings & Loan Association, earned $67.9 million, or $1.06 a share, down 2.9% from $69.9 million, or $1.10 a share, for the year-earlier period.
Irwindale-based H.F. Ahmanson & Co., parent of Home Savings of America, said earnings almost doubled to $28.5 million, or 14 cents a share, from $15.5 million, or 10 cents a share.
Analysts said the results were roughly in line with expectations, with Golden West performing slightly better than expected and Ahmanson slightly worse.
Golden West blamed its flat earnings partly on California's real-estate recession.
The company's results were aided by a one-time gain of $17 million, because of a reduction in the value of an investment allowance charged against income in previous years.
The company also strengthened its provision for loan losses and reduced income by $9 million to form a reserve for the relocation of selected branch offices.
Ahmanson's earnings were affected by a nonrecurring charge of $21.6 million, resulting from the early retirement of $325 million of Home Savings debt.
The company's asset quality improved during the quarter, with nonperforming assets equalling 1.89% of total assets, the lowest level since January 1991.
"This is a turnaround," Joseph Jolson, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, said of Ahmanson.
"But it is to some extent a turnaround tied to the Southern California economy," whose prospects are uncertain in the wake of this month's big earthquake.
For the year, Ahmanson reported a net loss of $159.6 million, or $1.69 a share, for 1993 compared with earnings of $204.1 million, or $1.60 a share, for 1992.
Golden West posted earnings of $273.9 million, or $4.28 a share, for 1993, down 3.5% from $283.5 million, or $4.46 a share, for 1992.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Ahmanson stock rose 25 cents, or 1.4%, to close at $18.625 a share, while Golden West stock fell 12.5 cents, or 0.3%, to close at $43.625.
