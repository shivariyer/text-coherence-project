In regard to the following statement by Patricia McGuire, president of Trinity College ("Protecting `Male Only' Access to Power," Letters, March 9): "Ever since King Solomon dangled that sword over the baby's head, men have used cruel emotional devices to force women to make unpalatable choices: threaten to kill their babies, and they will cave in."
Actually, King Solomon was presented with a dispute he had by law and custom to resolve.
The dispute was brought before him by one or both of the women.
Both claimed to be the mother of a baby.
To resolve the dispute, he stated that the baby ought to be cut in two so each woman would have an equal portion of the child.
Immediately, one of the women spoke up and surrendered her claim that the child might live.
Solomon, rather wisely I think, concluded that this woman acted as a mother would, punished the liar and delivered the healthy child back to its mother.
Solomon's justice was swift and true.
It is likely that a wise old queen would have acted in the same fashion as the wise old King Solomon.
