Nextel Communications Inc. said it plans to team up with a unit of Motorola Inc. and Clearnet Inc. to offer voice and data service on pocketphones in Canadian markets.
Nextel, Rutherford, N.J., earlier agreed to issue about 35.5 million shares in exchange for certain dispatch communications properties held by Motorola.
Motorola will transfer part of its stake in Clearnet to Nextel.
Motorola's stake is held by its Motorola Canada Ltd. unit.
"At the end of the day we'll own about 35% of Clearnet," a Nextel spokesman said.
Clearnet, a closely held provider of dispatch services in Pickering, Ontario, is considering plans to go public this year.
Nextel, which operates dispatch services for taxicabs and other fleet services, has ambitious plans to build a digital communications network in the U.S. and sell voice, data and dispatch service on cellular-like phones.
The latest agreement would allow Nextel customers to use their phones in Canada.
MCI Communications Inc. recently agreed to invest $1.36 billion in Nextel, in return for a 17% stake.
