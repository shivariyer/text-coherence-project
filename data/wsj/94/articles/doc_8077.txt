Fourth-quarter net income at Texaco Inc. and Amoco Corp. rose because of extraordinary items that propped up their numbers.
But sharply lower crude oil prices during the last few months of 1993 drove operating earnings lower for Texaco and Amoco and for Atlantic Richfield Co., which posted a loss.
Ashland Oil Inc.'s net income and operating earnings both rose.
But Amerada Hess Corp. swung to a loss in its fiscal first-quarter, ended Dec. 31.
Crude oil prices began to weaken last summer as it became apparent that global supplies of oil far exceeded demand.
And failure by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to a production cut at its November meeting exacerbated the situation, causing the price decline to quicken.
Output from producers outside OPEC has also grown in recent months, especially in the North Sea, where a number of new oil fields started up during the last half of the year.
The result was a drop in energy prices that hurt most producers, but helped some oil companies with big refining and marketing operations.
"Crude oil prices during the fourth-quarter of 1993 averaged about $4 per barrel below the fourth-quarter of 1992, and U.S. natural gas prices, though strong, were also below the comparable 1992 quarter," said Amoco's chief executive officer, H. Laurance Fuller.
TEXACO Inc.
Texaco said its fourth-quarter net income climbed 8.3% to $339 million, or $1.21 a share, from the year-ago $313 million, or $1.11 a share, which was depressed by a charge.
In the latest period, the company had a gain from tax benefits related to asset sales.
Revenue slipped 9.4% to $8.58 billion from $9.48 billion.
Quarterly operating earnings, however, fell 34% to $284 million as oil prices slumped, the White Plains, N.Y., company said.
Net income for 1993 grew 21% to $1.26 billion, or $4.47 a share, from $1.04 billion, or $3.63 a share.
Cost-cutting benefits achieved in the exploration and production sector in the U.S. during the fourth-quarter were more than offset by tumbling oil prices.
Overseas, quarterly earnings from this sector of the business fell sharply even though production grew 18%, primarily in Indonesia and the North Sea.
But Texaco's bottom line got some help from strong profit margins in its U.S. retail marketing business.
The company said that gasoline sales in the U.S. grew during the fourth quarter from the previous year's level.
Quarterly earnings from the refining and marketing sectors in the U.S. and overseas jumped substantially.
Amoco said its fourth-quarter net earnings of $584 million, or $1.17 a share, grew by 6.6% from $548 million, or $1.10 a share.
The latest period's numbers included a gain from the sale of its stake in a Canadian energy company.
Revenue edged about 2% higher to $7.38 billion.
Net earnings for 1993 were reported at $1.82 billion, or $3.66 a share, against a loss of $74 million, or a negative 15 cents a share.
Mr. Fuller, Amoco chairman, said that the company has cut expenses by $600 million over the past 18 months and is continuing to slash costs to help offset the lower crude prices.
Helping to prop up the bottom line during the fourth quarter were refining and marketing operations, which showed earnings jumping to $259 million from $202 million.
Earnings from chemical operations also grew.
Amoco also said yesterday that output from its Whiting, Ind., refinery has been reduced because of damage from three weather-related fires, which flared up on Saturday and Sunday.
The company said it is allocating supplies to customers.
Units affected by the fires should return to operation within several weeks, the company said.
Arco reported a net loss of $330 million, or $2.06 a share, against earnings of $372 million, or $2.30 a share, during the same period a year earlier.
Revenue slipped by 4.4% to $4.76 billion from $4.98 billion.
For 1993, Arco reported net income fell 66% to $269 million, or $1.66 a share, from $801 million, or $4.96 a share, in 1992.
This past year's quarterly loss is the result of a big charge taken for the restructuring of its oil and gas operations in the lower 48 states.
Arco's oil production slipped in the lower 48, partly as the result of property sales.
Output in Alaska also continued to decline, although production from the new Point McIntyre Field helped to slow the decline there.
The price at which Arco could sell its U.S. crude dropped to $9.89 a barrel during the fourth-quarter from $13.25 during the same period a year ago.
But profitability from the company's refining and marketing sector grew, while earnings from coal operations jumped.
Profitability at the chemicals businesses also increased.
Arco also reported yesterday that its directors had approved a capital budget of $1.9 billion, slightly less than last year's budget of $2.1 billion.
About 60%, or $1.1 billion, of this year's outlay will go to exploration and production.
Another $430 million will go to help refining and marketing businesses comply with clean-air regulations that go into effect in 1995 and 1996.
Ashland's fiscal first-quarter profitability jumped 132% to $58 million, or 90 cents a share, from $24.7 million, or 41 cents a share.
Revenue was almost flat at $2.58 billion.
Ashland's fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
Ashland said its profitability is based largely on very lucrative refinery profit margins.
According to a spokesman, the company made a lot of money because of tight supplies of low-sulfur diesel fuel in the U.S. during the fourth quarter.
Clean-air regulations mandated the use of the low-sulfur variety of the fuel early during the quarter, but most refiners had inadequate supplies.
But, the spokesman said, Ashland had retooled its refineries earlier in the year, to meet demand for that fuel, which is used mostly by trucks.
Earnings from retail gasoline sales also grew, jumping 19% to $21 million.
Ashland's chief executive officer, John Hall, said that this most recent first-quarter represents the best performance since the same period during 1988.
Amerada Hess reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $133.6 million, or $1.45 a share, compared with profit of $17.9 million, or 21 cents a share, during the same period of 1992.
Revenue grew 1.9% to $1.65 billion from $1.62 billion.
The results include special charges related to closing down the company's refinery in Purvis, Miss., and writing down certain exploration and production assets.
Earnings from this sector slumped to $7.9 million from $106.1 million.
Refining and marketing operations showed a loss of $111 million.
For the year, Amerada reported a net loss of $268.2 million, or $2.90 a share, compared with net income of $7.5 million, or nine cents a share, in 1992.

Worried about the divergence between action in the Dow and in other indexes, many investors are selling shares to lock in some of their recent gains, analysts said.
"I can't tell you how many conversations I had with people today who are concerned about the narrow leadership," said Joseph DeMarco yesterday.

Gail Dudack, market strategist at S.G. Warburg & Co., said a divergence between the Dow Jones Utilities Average and the rest of the market typically lasts about five months before the broad market follows that average's lead.

"That is one of the largest warning signs.
It says to me that you should be on the lookout for what could go wrong.
I've been a bull for a long time, but I am getting increasingly neutral on the market," Ms. Dudack said.
