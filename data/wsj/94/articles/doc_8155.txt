Beckman Instruments Inc. said it will take a $135 million pretax charge against earnings to be spread over 1993 and 1994 to cover the cost of a major reorganization.
The Fullerton, Calif., supplier of products used for biological analysis in laboratories reported a loss of $67 million, or $2.41 a share, for the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with earnings of $12.4 million, or 44 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
The after-tax charge in the fourth quarter is $72.3 million, or $2.61 a share.
Sales for the recent quarter were $236.6 million, a decrease of 5.4% from $250.2 million a year earlier.
The company had said in October that it would take a charge for job eliminations and reorganization to cut costs, but it had not stated the amount of the charge.
Of the total pretax charge, $115 million will be taken in 1993 and $20 million in 1994 as the company eliminates at least 800 jobs.
Beckman's stock closed at $28 a share, up 12.5 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
