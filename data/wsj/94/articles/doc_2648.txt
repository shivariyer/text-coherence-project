The French government unexpectedly announced plans to privatize unprofitable computer maker Cie. des Machines Bull in an apparent bid to appease European Union officials who have been critical of generous state handouts to the company.
At the same time, Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery said yesterday that the government also planned to soon sell state-owned insurer Assurances Generales de France in order to raise funds to recapitalize a number of other nationalized companies.
Mr. Alphandery did not name the likely recipients of the estimated 23 billion French francs ($3.95 billion) that the AGF sale could raise, but other government officials suggested that Air France would top the list.
The government is also studying a capital increase for yet another unprofitable French state-owned company, retail banking group Credit Lyonnais.
Since it came to power last spring, France's right-wing government has sold off a number of its healthier companies -- including oil producer Elf Aquitaine, pharmaceutical maker Rhone Poulenc and the Banque Nationale de Paris banking group -- raising more than 75 billion francs so far from institutional and retail investors in France and abroad.
The sale of France's largest insurance group, Union des Assurances de Paris, is due to follow shortly.
Neither the date nor the price have been fixed yet but the UAP sale is expected to raise about 25 billion francs.
The government's plans for Bull come as a surprise because the computer maker's heavy losses in recent years would make it an unattractive option for most investors.
Also, some government ministers had been pushing for car maker Renault SA to be sold next.
