The New England Patriots squad was sold to a local businessman for a reported $170 million, in what was touted as the highest price for a professional football team.
The previous high was $140 million for expansion franchises awarded to Charlotte and Jacksonville late last year.
Neither James Orthwein -- who sold the team -- nor Robert Kraft, its new owner, would disclose a price.
The Boston Globe, however, reported Sunday that the price was an estimated $170 million, according to sources.
That would represent a tidy profit for Mr. Orthwein, who reportedly paid $106 million when he bought the Patriots in May 1992.
The sale means the team will continue to play its games at Foxboro Stadium, the Foxboro, Mass., facility also owned by Mr. Kraft.
Apparently, the home-field advantage proved to be an insurmountable advantage for other bidders, which included a group from Hartford, Conn., and another from St. Louis.
Mr. Orthwein faced the possibility of a lawsuit if the Patriots did not fulfill their lease with Mr. Kraft to play at Foxboro through 2002.
