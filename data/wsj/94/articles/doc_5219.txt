Northwest Airlines and its partner KLM Royal Dutch Airlines launched a business class that will be offered on both carriers' international routes.
Northwest said the new service, called "World Business Class," is an outgrowth of a joint business class introduced on the two airlines' Minneapolis-Amsterdam and Boston-Amsterdam flights a year ago.
"World Business Class" now offers more legroom, upgraded menus, improved amenity kits and state-of-the-art personal entertainment systems.
KLM has a 7.5% voting stake in closely held Northwest, which is based in St. Paul, Minn.
The two carriers have U.S. Transportation Department antitrust immunity to set prices and conduct marketing jointly.
Based in Amsterdam, KLM is partly owned by the Dutch government.
