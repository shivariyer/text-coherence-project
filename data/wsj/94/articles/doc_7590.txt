While German automobile output is expected to stabilize this year following last year's brutal plunge, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, in Frankfurt, forecasts its business will rebound in 1994.
Separately, yesterday, Germany's main automobile-industry trade group made a plea for relief from high wage costs just as the industry's union prepared token "warning" strikes next week to pressure employers for higher pay.
German auto workers are already the highest paid in the world, the VDA German Automobile Industry Association asserted.
In a preliminary report on its 1993 business, BMW repeated its claim that it fared better than its German competition last year.
While rival car makers Mercedes-Benz AG and Volkswagen AG expect losses for 1993, BMW declared it had a "definite profit."
The company's 1993 earnings would be lower than 1992 levels, it added, but didn't give any figures.
