Forget acupuncture and herbal cures.
There's nothing like a good rubdown while you're knocked out.
Chiropractors call the treatment "manipulation under anesthesia," or MUA.
And many of them in Texas are learning its secrets, for use on everything from sciatic pain to some back disk ailments.
"It's not necessarily a cure," cautions Stephen Capps, a Houston chiropractor who teaches his peers MUA.
About 1% of chiropractic patients need it, he says, and he performs one or two treatments a month.
One hitch: Texas chiropractors can't administer general anesthetics, so a medical doctor must be used, jacking up the cost.
The going rate for a half-hour MUA in Houston: $3,500.
Another caveat: Medical doctors say any procedure involving general anesthesia can encounter complications.
Some patients say MUA is worth it.
They say the anesthesia allows for more in-depth treatment that relieves chronic pain.
And some insurers will pay for MUA when it is meant to relieve pain, particularly if there's evidence of past joint-dislocation problems.
But many insurers say they won't cover it.
"There's no evidence that massage under anesthesia is an appropriate procedure," says Kathy Worthington, a medical-claims official for Aetna Life & Casualty Co., based in Hartford, Conn.
