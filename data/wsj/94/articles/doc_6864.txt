Southwest Airlines reported fourth-quarter and year-end profits that were more than 40% higher than a year earlier.
Dallas-based Southwest said it had fourth-quarter net income of $38.4 million, or 26 cents a share, on revenue of $608.5 million.
For the year-earlier period, Southwest earned $26.7 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $483.3 million.
The results include those of Morris Air Corp., which Southwest bought in December through issuing 3,574,656 common shares and accounting for the purchase as a pooling of interest.
The deal was valued at about $128 million.
Southwest had a one-time charge in the fourth quarter from merger costs, which reduced net income by $6.3 million, or four cents a share.
For the year, net income was $169.5 million, or $1.15 a share, compared with the year-earlier $109.9 million, or 77 cents a share.
Revenue rose to $2.29 billion from $1.80 billion.
