ITT Corp. has emerged as the favored candidate in the bidding war for Ciga SpA, an Italian luxury-hotel chain with 35 hotels and more than 5,500 rooms throughout Europe.
According to people close to the bidding, Mediobanca, a Milan merchant bank acting as an agent for Ciga's creditors, recommended that banks accept ITT's approximately 900 billion lire ($530.5 million) cash bid.
A bid from British hotel group Forte PLC, which had the backing of U.S. financier George Soros's Quantum Fund, apparently came in at about 800 billion lire.
Host Marriott Corp., Washington, D.C., was among the other bidders.
ITT declined to comment on the news, but Wall Street analysts said the move would better position the conglomerate to spin off its ITT Sheraton hotel chain.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, ITT shares closed at $99.625, up $2.
Forte said the Sheraton bid was "considerably higher" than its own and that the group didn't plan to raise its bid.
But people close to the talks said they didn't rule out a counteroffer from the British group.
Sheraton's cash offer would permit Ciga to recoup more than 70% of its debts, according to Italian news reports.
Ciga went into default on its loans last year and its shares were suspended from the Milan stock exchange.
Ciga, which was developed by the Aga Khan before creditor banks took charge last year, is considered one of Italy's premier luxury hotel chains and includes the prestigious Danieli in Venice, the Grand Hotel in Rome and the Palace in Madrid.
Industry observers said the purchase would substantially boost Sheraton's visibility overseas, but noted that high-end chains are expensive to operate and the European hotel market as a whole continues to show some weakness.
