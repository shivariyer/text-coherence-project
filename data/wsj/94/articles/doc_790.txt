Zenith Laboratories Inc. said a federal appeals court cleared the way for the company to sell a generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s antibiotic, Duricef.
Zenith's president, John H. Klein, said the company plans to launch the generic version, cefadroxil, in the near future, and noted that most of Zenith's generic drugs are priced 30% to 40% below the branded drug.
U.S. sales of Duricef were more than $150 million in 1993.
A spokesman for Bristol-Myers said the company is studying the court opinion and considering its legal options.
Zenith received Food and Drug Administration approval for cefadroxil in April 1992.
But U.S. District Judge Alfred M. Wolin in Newark, N.J., ruled in July 1992 that the Zenith product infringed a Bristol-Myers patent.
Bristol-Myers contended that during digestion, the Zenith drug is converted to a molecule patented by Bristol-Myers.
Zenith said the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington reversed the lower court's decision, thus allowing the company to begin making and selling cefadroxil.
Before the April 1992 decision, three generic versions of the drug had garnered 55% of the market in just 10 months, Mr. Klein said.
