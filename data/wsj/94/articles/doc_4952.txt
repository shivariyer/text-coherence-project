German energy, mining and engineering group RWE AG reported group net profit for the fiscal first half increased 1.5% to 401 million marks ($232.7 million) from 395 million marks a year earlier.
Sales were up 3.1% in the July-through-December period to 27.5 billion marks ($15.95 billion), the company said.
RWE also said in its first-half report that it expects full-year profit to be slightly above fiscal 1993's level of 881 million marks.
The energy group's sales increase was sparked by a first-time consolidation of some units into the group's results, RWE said.
It also noted that the results reflect stability in the energy and building sectors and a clear increase in the petroleum and chemical sectors.
