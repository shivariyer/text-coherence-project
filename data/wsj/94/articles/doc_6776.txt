In the sluggish soft-drink industry last year, Coca-Cola Co. gained U.S. market share, while rival PepsiCo Inc.'s share fell, a new study shows.
In the soft-drink industry, market-share movements are a closely watched measurement of company performance.
Figures were released yesterday by the Maxwell Consumer Report on the soft-drink industry, an annual statistical survey of beverage trends.
According to the Maxwell report, Coca-Cola increased its share of the market to 41.1% from 40.6% in 1992.
PepsiCo.'s share slipped to 30.8% from 31.3% in 1992.
Industry experts said much of Coke's strength can be attributed to its strong gains in the fountain industry.
Meanwhile, Pepsi's top two brands, Pepsi and Diet Pepsi, posted lackluster performance.
Diet Pepsi lost its ranking as the fourth best-selling drink to Dr Pepper, according to Beverage Digest, a trade publication that yesterday released a market-share report.
The Maxwell report estimates that the total soft-drink industry grew at 2.9% in 1993, excluding tea products.
That compares with a 1.5% growth rate in 1992.
The 1990s have proved to be a time of much slower growth than the past decade, when the industry was posting volume gains of 5% to 7%.
The market share for colas continued to drop, to 67% of the market compared with 68.3% in 1992, according to the Maxwell report.
The market share for diet soft drinks also declined for the second year in a row.
