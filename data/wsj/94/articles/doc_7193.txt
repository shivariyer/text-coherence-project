Stocks soared to highs after a surprisingly upbeat report on the economy from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
Moving within striking distance of the 4000 mark, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 32.93 points to 3978.36, its third-straight record.
Standard & Poor's 500 stock index also rolled to a high, climbing 2.91 to 481.61, and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 3.94 points to 800.47, another record.
Trading was extremely heavy.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange swelled to 322,750,000 shares from 312,630,000 shares Friday.
According to the New York Stock Exchange, January as a whole was the busiest month on record for the Big Board with total volume of around 6.6 billion shares.
October 1987, the month of the stock market crash, had been the busiest at 6.1 billion shares.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 1,396 to 733.
Stocks analysts said that while the equity market was poised for a rally after Friday's strong report on fourth-quarter gross domestic report, yesterday's gains were helped by Mr. Greenspan.
"Greenspan's testimony about the economy was extremely upbeat," said Stefan Abrams, director of equity strategy at Trust Co. of the West.
Added John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers: "For the stock market, I suspect the most important element was the optimistic view of the sustainability of economic growth that was offered by Greenspan."
Although stock prices clearly were fired up by Mr. Greenspan's comments before the Joint Economic Committee, the stage for a rally in stocks was set hours earlier in Tokyo, where the Nikkei stock average rocketed after the Japanese parliament endorsed a series of political reform bills.
In addition, analysts said there were several positive developments on the corporate front that helped unleash the powerful gains in stocks.
News that the major aluminum-producing nations agreed to cut global production boosted aluminum stocks, driving Aluminum Co. of America, a component of the Dow, up 2 7/8 to 79 1/8.
Investors are betting that aluminum prices, after being depressed for several years, will firm up in the wake of a production cutback.
Auto stocks jumped on reports that auto makers are expected to extinguish cash rebates for new-car buyers because the strengthening economy is likely to continue to spur rising demand.
Chrysler raced 1 5/8 point higher to 61 1/2, Ford 1 3/4 to 67 and General Motors 2 to 61 1/4.
Investors nodded favorably after United Technologies named President and Chief Operating Officer George David chief executive.
United Technologies surged 2 3/8 to 67 3/8.
Stock buyers also liked Aetna Life & Casualty's move Friday to eliminate 4,000 jobs or 10% of its work force.
Aetna added 3 1/2 points to 63 3/8.
"It was pretty much a good news day all around," said Gail Dudack, stock strategist at S.G. Warburg.
"It wasn't just in the U.S., and it wasn't just the economy."
Shares of Xerox jumped 5 1/2, or 5.9%, to 98 1/8.
The company reported fourth-quarter operating profit of $2.07 a share, before charges of $813 million, compared with $2.07 in the year-earlier period.
In other earnings-related activity, Tellabs (Nasdaq) slipped 3, or 6.1%, to 46 after posting fourth-quarter net income of 67 cents a share.
That compares favorably with year-earlier net of 46 cents, but only matched what analysts had expected.
Allegheny Ludlum shed 1 1/2, or 6.3%, to 22 1/4 after reporting fourth-quarter net of 25 cents a share, including a gain of 9 cents, compared with 17 cents a year earlier.
Analysts had expected the company to earn 25 cents a share before the gain.
General DataComm Industries rose 19%, or 2 1/4, to 14 on positive comments from Soundview Financial Group.
The brokerage firm initiated coverage of the stock with a long-term "buy" rating and said the data-processing and telecommunications-equipment firm is well-positioned as a long-term player in the market for ATM, or asynchronous transfer mode, switches.
On the American Stock Exchange, Triarc Cos., formerly DWG Corp., tumbled 3 3/8 , or 14%, to 20 7/8 in heavy trading.
Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Michael Bunyaner slashed his 1994 earnings estimate for the New York conglomerate to a range of $1.20 to $1.30 a share from his original estimate of $2.25 a share, but still recommends purchase of the stock.
The company's Royal Crown Cola Co. unit, neglected under former DWG Chairman Victor Posner, has higher-than-expected marketing and other expenses, Mr. Bunyaner said in a report, and its textile unit, Graniteville Co., is undergoing a cyclical slowdown sooner than he anticipated.
Shares of Maxxim Medical (AMEX) slipped 1 to 18.
The Sugarland, Texas, medical-product supply company filed with the SEC for a secondary offering of 2.4 million common shares.
Maxxim said two million shares, together with any overallotment shares, are new shares being sold by the company.
Novell improved 3/4 to 22 5/8.
The computer-software company said it has begun shipping Novell DOS 7, an upgrade to DR DOS 6.0.
TRIARC Cos.' shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Yesterday's Abreast of the Market column incorrectly said the company's stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange.
