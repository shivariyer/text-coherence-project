Coors Brewing Co., a unit of Adolph Coors Co., filed a lawsuit against rivals Miller Brewing Co., Molson Breweries and Molson Cos. in U.S. District Court in Denver, alleging their alliance violates U.S. antitrust laws by restricting Coors's ability to compete in the U.S. and Canada.
Coors also asked a Canadian arbitrator to allow it to sever a Coors-Molson licensing pact under which Molson makes Coors beer for distribution in Canada.
In 1993 Milwaukee-based Miller purchased Molson Breweries U.S.A., the U.S. distribution arm of Molson Cos., and took a 20% equity position in the Molson Partnership.
The Toronto-based Molson Partnership owns the Molson breweries.
Molson Cos. holds a 40% stake in the partnership and Foster's Brewing Group Ltd. of Australia holds the other 40%.
Miller is a unit of Philip Morris Cos.
Coors says the Miller-Molson alliance encourages Molson to inhibit the success of Coors in Canada and could affect Molson decisions about brewing Coors for export.
Representatives of Miller and Molson said the companies think the Coors action has no merit.
