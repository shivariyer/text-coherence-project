President Clinton named John Truesdale to an interim slot on the National Labor Relations Board, giving the panel a quorum for the first time in more than a month.
Mr. Truesdale, currently executive secretary of the board and a former board member, becomes the third member of the panel, which is designed to have five members.
The nominations of Stanford University law professor William Gould IV to be chairman and Philadelphia lawyer Margaret Browning have been held up in the Senate by Republicans who are fighting for a say over the third vacancy.
The board stopped taking cases late last year after member John Raudabaugh left for private practice, leaving the board with only two members, one short of a quorum.
The recess appointment of Mr. Truesdale, who served on the board from 1977 to 1981, will end when a new board member is confirmed by the Senate.
