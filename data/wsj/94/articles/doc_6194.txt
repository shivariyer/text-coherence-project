Compaq Computer Corp., hedging its bets in the personal-computer industry's latest chip war, downplayed a new chip backed by International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc., but said it might still join them if the device turns out to be a big seller.
Compaq President and Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer said in a briefing to reporters here that he doubted PCs based on the new chip will sell fast enough to create an industry standard -- but he indicated that he's keeping his options open anyway.
"We're currently exploring the feasibility and requirements" of making PCs that could run on either the new PowerPC chip or on today's industry-standard Intel Corp. designs, he said.
Gary Stimac, a Compaq senior vice president, said the Houston-based company plans by 1995 or 1996 to have developed a "server" PC into which a customer can plug printed-circuit boards containing Intel chips, PowerPC or a third chip flavor, MIPS from Silicon Graphics Inc. (A server is a souped-up PC used to handle common tasks for networks of other PCs.)
The cautious strategy from the world's third-biggest PC maker (after IBM and Apple) reflects the quandary now facing the industry as IBM, Apple and Motorola Inc. promote their jointly developed PowerPC standard.
So far only one group of products, IBM's RS6000 workstations, are on the market using PowerPC.
"Our view is that most people won't shift to a PowerPC processor" from Intelbased systems, Mr. Stimac said.
Similarly, Mr. Pfeiffer said that by the time PowerPCs become widely available, Intel will have new chips on the market matching PowerPC's performance.
