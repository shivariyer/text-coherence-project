Morrison Knudsen Corp. said it won a $20 million contract to install light rail track in Los Angeles.
The contract was awarded by the Los Angeles County Transportation Authority.
Construction, scheduled to begin immediately, will run through early 1997.
The engineering and construction concern said it also is the apparent low bidder on a $27 million contract for laying light rail near Portland, Ore.
