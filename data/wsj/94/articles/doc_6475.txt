A BellSouth Corp. subsidiary said it sold its interest in the Mexican cellular company Communicaciones Celulares de Occidente SA to Grupo Iusacell SA.
Although details of the transaction weren't disclosed, BellSouth said it expects the sale to boost its earnings.
Comcel began providing cellular telephone service throughout western Mexico, including the city of Guadalajara, in August 1990.
Charles B. Coe, president of BellSouth International, said, "We continue to look for other opportunities in Latin America, including Mexico."
