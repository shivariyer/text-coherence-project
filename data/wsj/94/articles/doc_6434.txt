One worker died, and two were sent to the hospital for observation and released following an apparent hydrogen-sulfide gas leak Thursday at Shell Chemical Co.'s Deer Park Complex east of Houston.
The three, all employees of Brown & Root Inc., a unit of oil-services concern Halliburton Co., were in the plant doing maintenance work for Shell Chemical, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group Inc.
A Brown & Root spokeswoman said George Betancourt, a 31-year-old pipefitter helper, was found unconscious and taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.
She didn't identify the two other men.
Shell Chemical spokesman Dennis Winkler said a hydrogen-sulfide alarm did sound in the area where Mr. Betancourt was found, indicating a gas leak may have occurred.
An investigative team was formed to determine what happened.
Mr. Winkler said the men were performing routine maintenance on the treatment unit, where hydrogen sulfide is removed from crude oil.
Workers in that area are required to wear respiratory equipment for protection from the gas, which can cause severe respiratory complications and, at high concentrations, can make breathing impossible.
Mr. Betancourt was wearing the required respiratory equipment, Mr. Winkler said.
The problem was contained to the immediate area and had no impact on other units on the 1,500-acre complex, Mr. Winkler said.
The maintenance is to resume when Shell determines it is safe.
