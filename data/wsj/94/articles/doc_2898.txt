Argentine petroleum company Astra Capsa said it signed an $85 million contract with Spanish ship builder Astilleros Espanoles SA for the construction of two oil tankers.
In a statement to the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, Astra said it must first get favorable financing for the purchases.
The deadline for securing financing is March 30, after which the contract will be annulled, Astra said.
Astilleros Espanoles plans to build the ships within the next two years, Astra said.
