The Finance Ministry announced that Mr. Cordoba, a powerful political figure, has been appointed Mexico's envoy to the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C.
The move comes as the crisis-ridden ruling party, known by its initials PRI, chose Ernesto Zedillo, a 42-year-old economist, to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate assassinated last week in Tijuana, Mexico.
Mr. Zedillo was viewed by some as too closely associated with Mr. Cordoba.
The view had been advanced that Mr. Zedillo wouldn't be his own man, but rather a puppet of the current president.
One analyst said the removal of Mr. Cordoba was a deal cut with hard-liners to allow Mr. Zedillo to be the PRI's candidate.
Mr. Cordoba was also disliked by more reform-minded PRI members, as well as opposition-party leaders.
With a guerrilla uprising in the south and the assassination, Mr. Salinas is moving to control damage to his presidency, one analyst said.
