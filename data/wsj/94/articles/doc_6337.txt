Riverwood International Corp., citing continuing declines in containerboard prices and weak international demand, reported a net loss of $4.6 million, or seven cents a share, for its 1993 fourth quarter, compared with net income of $8.2 million, or 13 cents a share, in the year earlier quarter.
Sales for the quarter slid 4% to $286.8 million from $299.4 million.
For the year, the Atlanta paperboard and packaging company reported a plunge in net income to $1.1 million, or two cents a share, from $43.8 million, or 78 cents a share, in 1992, as sales for the year remained essentially flat at $1.12 billion.
Results for both the quarter and the year included a $25 million restructuring charge from efforts to consolidate operations, offset in part by a $17 million gain on the sale of timberlands.
Results for the year also included a charge of $2.1 million from restating post-employment benefits under new accounting standards.
