AlliedSignal Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to buy the fluorochemicals business of Akzo Chemicals BV of the Netherlands.
Terms weren't disclosed.
But a spokesman for AlliedSignal, based in Morristown, N.J., said sales of the Akzo fluorochemicals business should total about $18 million in 1994.
Akzo Chemicals is a unit of Akzo NV.
The Akzo business makes hydrofluoric acid, the key raw material in fluorocarbons, used in refrigeration and foam-insulation, among other things.
The agreement calls for AlliedSignal to buy Akzo's manufacturing plants in Weert, the Netherlands, which employ about 70 people.
AlliedSignal has aerospace, automotive-products and engineered-materials interests.
Akzo's products include chemicals, fibers, coatings and health-care products.
