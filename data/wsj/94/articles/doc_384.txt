In a widely anticipated move, the New York Power Authority voted to cancel a $5 billion, 20-year contract to purchase electricity from Hydro-Quebec.
The authority cited several reasons for the cancellation, including concerns about Hydro-Quebec's planned power projects in the James Bay region.
The projects have come under fire from environmental and native-peoples advocates.
Earlier this month, S. David Freeman, president and chief executive officer of the power authority, told a state assembly environmental committee that he would recommend cancellation of the agreement.
Hydro-Quebec consented that the agreement no longer made sense with the changing electricity market, specifically falling power prices.
The contract allowed for either party to cancel the agreement between May 30, 1994, and the end of the year.
The current agreement between Hydro-Quebec and the power authority runs through 1998.
Meanwhile, Consolidated Edison Co. of New York is negotiating a power purchase agreement directly with Hydro-Quebec.
