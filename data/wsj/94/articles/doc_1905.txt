A unit of Hitachi Ltd. said it will pay $21.1 million for a 10% stake in California Micro Devices Corp., in an alliance that could raise the profile of a little-known semiconductor technology with big potential.
The news sent California Micro's stock up 52%, or $7.25, to $21.25 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Hitachi Metals Ltd. said it would buy 880,000 shares for $24 each, a hefty premium over California Micro's recent trading price.
In exchange for the cash, California Micro will license Hitachi to jointly manufacture and market a technology -- dubbed thin-film integrated passive electronic components, or IPECs -- that can slash the number of devices and manufacturing steps that computer companies and others need to make their products.
In addition to integrated circuit chips, computers require hundreds of resistors, capacitors and other components that are made from bulky ceramic materials and must be separately placed on circuit boards.
California Micro, exploiting technology developed for military contracts over 14 years, packs those components together in tiny spaces by laying down thin films of special metals on silicon wafers.
About five of these IPECs can replace about 350 components on a standard PC circuit board, the company says.
Thomas Thornhill, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, said Hitachi's manufacturing and marketing muscle should enable the companies to begin to take a significant chunk of the $8 billion to $10 billion market for the older component technology.
In the six months ended December 31, California Micro Devices earned $1.8 million, or 24 cents a share, on sales of $10.2 million.
