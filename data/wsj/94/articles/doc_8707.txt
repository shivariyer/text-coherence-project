The old dog of the U.S. bus business is learning some new tricks from its Mexican peers.
In anticipation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Dallas-based Greyhound Lines Inc. signed a reciprocal ticketing agreement in 1992 with Estrella Blanca, a Mexico City bus company.
While the link has raised Greyhound ridership in Laredo, El Paso and McAllen, the gains haven't been big enough to merit adding drivers or service.
But Greyhound thinks its tie with the Mexican industry may pay off in another way.
It is taking a close look at introducing in the U.S. the "premium service" offered by some Mexican carriers.
In essence a ground-based variant on first-class air travel, premium service includes such amenities as wider seats and aisles, onboard movies and beverage service.
Most Greyhound customers in the U.S. tend to be low- to middle-income people who probably wouldn't pay extra for the white-glove treatment.
But Greyhound executives say premium service might give the bus line an edge among white-collar commuters in some markets, such as the Boston-Washington corridor.
"It's a direction we're heading in," a Greyhound spokesman says.
