The company said it created a post to help launch its entry into the Mexican market.
Bill Pena, 40 years old, was named to the new position of vice president/general manager for Mexico.
The appointment is the first indication that the company has plans to enter Mexico, and follows a recent push into Canada.
Home Depot, which operates 271 home-improvement stores in 23 states, wouldn't disclose its specific plans for entering the Mexican market.
But a spokesman said it is a "natural extension" for the company.
Prior to joining Home Depot, Mr. Pena had been senior vice president and general merchandise manager for Homebase, a Fulterton, Calif.-based home-improvement retailer.
