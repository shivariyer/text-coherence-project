ATMOS ENERGY Corp., Dallas, said it approved a 3-for-2 split of its common stock with a record date 15 days after required regulatory approvals.
The natural-gas service company said shareholders will receive one new share for every two shares held, with fractional shares being paid in cash.
The split will increase shares outstanding to slightly more than 15 million from about 10 million.
Atmos also said the quarterly dividend of 33 cents a share announced yesterday would be adjusted to 22 cents a share if the record date for the stock split occurs prior to Feb. 25.
