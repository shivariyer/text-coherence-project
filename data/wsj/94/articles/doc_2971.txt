Digital Equipment Corp., trying to turn around its unprofitable European operations, said it would cut 6,000 jobs, or roughly twice the number it indicated earlier this year might be eliminated.
The reductions, representing about 15% of the Massachusetts-based company's work force in Europe, are expected to take place over the next 18 months.
The cutbacks are meant to be a key element in the strategy of Vincenzo Damiani, who took over as head of Digital Europe in January, a spokesman said.
Digital Europe has recently completed a reorganization that will divide the company's sales and support functions into three parts: large accounts, general accounts, and servicing of existing clients, including those firms that repackage or reconfigure some of Digital's equipment.
The cuts, which were first discussed publicly in January, will reduce Digital's European staff to about 25,000.
Employees are expected to receive letters explaining the planned reductions over the next few days.
"It's a bottom-up thing," the spokesman said.
"We will be examining each function and deciding which specific positions need to be eliminated."
Digital receives about 50% of its revenue from Europe.
