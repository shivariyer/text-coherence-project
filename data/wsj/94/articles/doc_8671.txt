Shareholders of Dresser Industries Inc. and Baroid Corp. approved Dresser's proposed acquisition of Baroid, prompting Standard & Poor's Corp. to raise its rating on Baroid's $150 million of 8% senior notes due April 15, 2003.
As previously announced, Dresser will acquire Baroid in a stock transaction valued at about $850 million.
Dresser, based in Dallas, and Baroid, Houston, are both energy services companies.
S&P raised its rating on Baroid's notes to single-A-minus from double-B-plus and removed the notes from CreditWatch, where they were placed last September.
S&P said the upgrade reflects the credit quality of Dresser, which intends to guarantee Baroid's debt.
