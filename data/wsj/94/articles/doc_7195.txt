Pierre E. Leroy, formerly treasurer and vice president, business development and planning, at this farm-equipment manufacturer, was named to the newly created post of chief financial officer and senior vice president, finance and accounting.
Mr. Leroy, 45 years old, will maintain responsibility for business development and planning.
The treasurer's position hasn't yet been filled.
In the new post, the company said, Mr. Leroy assumes part of the duties of several executives, including some that had been held by Eugene Schotanus, 56, who continues in his "primary role" of overseeing Deere's credit, insurance and health-care businesses.
