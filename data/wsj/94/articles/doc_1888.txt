Zeos International Ltd. said it scrapped a plan to buy CompuAdd Computer Corp., a competitor in the mail-order computer business.
In a join statement, the two companies said they were unable to agree on terms of the deal and decided to end their discussions.
Zeos, based in Minneapolis, in January announced a nonbinding letter of intent to buy CompuAdd, a privately held computer company based in Austin, Texas.
Terms of the cash and stock deal weren't disclosed at the time.
Zeos officials couldn't be reached to comment on the collapsed deal, which was announced after the close of Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Zeos stock closed unchanged at $3.125.
A CompuAdd spokesman declined to detail why the agreement collapsed, saying "It just didn't pan out."
When it was announced, the Zeos-CompuAdd combination was cited by some industry analysts as evidence of a consolidation in the personal-computer business, which has been hit hard by falling prices and declining profit margins.
