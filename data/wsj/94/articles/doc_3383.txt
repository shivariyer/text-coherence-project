A committee representing Future Communications Inc.'s shareholders asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to appoint an independent trustee to oversee the company's operations.
In a court filing, the committee accused officials of the Dallas cable television and programming company of thwarting the committee's efforts to learn more about the company's condition.
Future's bankruptcy attorney said he expects the company will oppose the appointment of an independent trustee.
He said the company favors its reorganization plan, under which it would sell its assets to two tiny companies owned in part by the family of its former chairman and chief executive, Sergio Bosco.
Future filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection in November, after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company and Mr. Bosco for allegedly fraudulently inflating its stock price.
