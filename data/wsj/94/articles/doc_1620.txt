Canada's consumer price index declined in February for the second consecutive month, dropping 0.9% from January, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
The decline in the seasonally adjusted index resulted mainly from a 38.3% drop in cigarette prices in February, as a result of reductions in cigarette taxes.
The federal government and the provincial governments of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick cut their cigarette taxes to discourage cigarette smuggling.
The February decline in the consumer price index followed a 0.2% drop in January.
In December the index rose 0.2%.
Separately, the Canadian government's labor bureau reported that collective bargaining settlements reached in January provided wage increases averaging 0.6% annually.
The January increase is in keeping with the pattern of historically low wage-settlements recorded in recent months, the bureau said.
