Sony Corp. expects earnings to remain weak in the next fiscal year, Executive Deputy President Ken Iwaki said.
A recovery in earnings is "dependent on the Japanese economy and German economy recovering," Mr. Iwaki said.
Neither country, he said, "has shown signs of hitting the bottom."
Earnings at the major Japanese consumer-electronics manufacturer have been under pressure for the last several years due to saturation of its main markets and, more recently, because of the high yen.
A high yen makes Japanese products more expensive overseas, and reduces the yen-based value of overseas sales.
In the six months ended Sept. 30, 1993, pretax profit rose 34% to 56.65 billion yen ($507.8 million), but 32.35 billion yen of that amount was a result of successful currency hedging.
Sales for the same period declined 9.5% on the year to 1.767 trillion yen, while operating profit for the period fell 45% to 37.49 billion yen.
