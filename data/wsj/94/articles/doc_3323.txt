The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has decided to hear local banks' case for a refund for taxes paid on interest earned from state bonds.
A ruling in their favor would mean a windfall of about $400 million in taxes already paid and interest thereon.
The banks are challenging a 1980 decision by the state Department of Revenue that the exemption from taxes on state authorities' bonds doesn't apply to corporations.
The tax department at the time imposed a 12.5% flat tax on interest on state authorities' bonds.
The Massachusetts banks -- including Bank of Boston Corp., Shawmut National Corp., BayBanks Inc., State Street Boston Corp. and South Shore Bank, argue that a 1952 enabling law for state authorities offers a blanket exemption and negates the later decision.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., acting on behalf of the defunct Bank of New England, is also a plaintiff in the case.
The Supreme Judicial Court sided with the Department of Revenue in 1989 when insurance companies contested the tax.
The banks sought an appeal, but U.S. Supreme Court decided not to consider the case.
The case could come up for review by the state's high court in May, attorneys say.
In deciding similar issues in other states, a majority of state courts have ruled in favor of their respective state governments.
But if the banks get the nod, they stand to receive one of the biggest tax refunds in recent Massachusetts state history.
