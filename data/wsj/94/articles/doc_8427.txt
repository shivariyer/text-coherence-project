Nova Corp. of Alberta announced a 501.4 million Canadian dollar (US$382.8 million) equity issue to help finance pipeline expansion and to establish a new line of business.
The Calgary pipeline and chemicals company said it expects to spend C$600 million this year and C$2 billion (US$1.53 billion) by the end of 1996 expanding its Alberta natural-gas pipeline system.
Nova said the equity infusion also will allow it to take advantage of opportunities in the emerging natural-gas marketing business.
The company spent C$1.5 billion in the past three years expanding the pipeline network and announced record natural-gas deliveries for the seventh consecutive year.
Its pipeline division said it delivered 3.8 trillion cubic feet of gas to Alberta gas users and connecting pipelines in 1993, up 10.9% from the previous year.
Nova has agreed to acquire 35% of closely held Natural Gas Clearinghouse, Houston, and to establish a gas-marketing joint venture with Clearinghouse in Canada.
Nova said it agreed to sell 52.5 million common shares at C$9.55 a share to Canadian public investors through a syndicate of Canadian underwriters led by RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Scotia McLeod Inc. and Burns Fry Ltd.
Nova had roughly 407 million common shares outstanding before the new share issue.
A spokesman said he expects the share issue to have a neutral effect on the company's 1994 net income and to lower its 1994 per-share earnings due to dilution.
Donald Pattison, an analyst with New York brokerage house C.J. Lawrence, said he still expects Nova to report 1993 earnings above the previous year's 33 cents a share, but well below his earlier forecast of 49 cents a share.
