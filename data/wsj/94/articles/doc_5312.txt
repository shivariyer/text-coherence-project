Anglo-American industrial conglomerate Hanson PLC said its fiscal first-quarter pretax profit fell 27% to #173 million ($257 million) from #236 million.
Hanson said the results were affected by #67 million in costs related to the strike at its Peabody coal mines in the U.S., as well as increased interest costs.
Sales in the period ended Dec. 31 grew 25% to #2.89 billion from #2.30 billion.
Excluding the cost of the strike, exceptional items and interest, Hanson would have reported profit of #230 million, up from #187 million a year earlier.
That includes a #25 million first-time contribution from Quantum Chemical Corp., which Hanson acquired last year.
Hanson said that increased net interest costs mostly were due to the narrowing of sterling-dollar interest spreads, shorter deposit maturities and acquisitions, including Quantum, totaling #2.9 billion.
The company continued to reduce debt with proceeds from the completion of certain disposals and has announced others, including the separate flotations in the U.S. and U.K. of the two Beazer Homes businesses.
