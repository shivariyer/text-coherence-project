State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. revised its losses from the Los Angeles earthquake to $1 billion, instead of $600 million, becoming the latest insurer to raise damage estimates.
The insurer, a unit of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., said the 67% increase stems from higher than anticipated levels of structural damage in 103,000 estimated claims.
The higher estimate follows an announcement last week that quake losses for Allstate Corp. would be 71% higher than originally estimated, or $600 million.
Earlier, 20th Century Industries, of Woodland Hills, Calif., doubled its estimate to $325 million.
Based on the upward revisions, industry experts believe insurers' losses from the Jan. 17 quake could top $4 billion, rivaling the $4.2 billion of claims paid for Hurricane Hugo in 1989.
A spokesman for Farmers Insurance Group of Companies says it is sticking with its original Feb. 16 estimate of $600 million in losses, based on 27,000 claims.
