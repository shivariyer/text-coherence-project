The Internal Revenue Service is giving a break to users of diesel fuel during the cold-weather snap.
The IRS is waiving a tax penalty it applies when nontaxed fuel, such as that used for home heating or farming or by state and local governments, is mixed with taxable fuel, such as the diesel fuel that truckers use.
To crack down on tax evasion in the diesel-fuel industry, the government has begun requiring the addition of red and blue dyes to nontaxable fuel.
The requirement, which took effect Jan. 1, is intended to make it easier for IRS inspectors to tell when a fuel is taxable.
The IRS expects the change to bring an additional $1 billion in revenues over the next five years.
But the cold weather chilling the East Coast has raised concerns over a shortage of home heating fuel.
Moreover, during the extreme cold, it is often necessary to add kerosene -- which is taxable -- to the nontaxed home-heating fuel to improve viscosity.
"The IRS recognizes that extreme and unexpected weather conditions may necessitate the addition" of undyed products to dyed fuel, the agency said.
The IRS said, however, that it will penalize anyone who uses the mixed fuel for a taxable purpose.
