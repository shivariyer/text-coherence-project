National Semiconductor Corp. said the patent-infringement lawsuit it filed last July against Mitsubishi Electric Corp. in Los Angeles and Durham, N.C., federal courts has been settled.
National Semiconductor, based in Santa Clara, Calif., had alleged that Tokyo-based Mitsubishi illegally used some of its proprietary chip technologies in Mitsubishi products.
Before the suit was filed, the two companies had engaged in cross-licensing talks for two years but reached no agreements.
Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
National Semiconductor said the two companies also resolved a related complaint it lodged with the U.S. International Trade Commission.
