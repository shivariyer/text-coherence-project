Your article in the Feb. 2 edition on the uses of the sales tax for economic development ("Tax Aimed at the Creation of Jobs Misses Mark") dwelt on the actions of cities that have abused or misused the revenue.
Fortunately, most of the 136 cities that have authorized collection under the legislation are using the funds in a constructive manner to advance their respective economic-development programs.
Unfortunately, the relatively few that are abusing the privilege may spoil it for the vast majority who are complying with the spirit of the legislation.
