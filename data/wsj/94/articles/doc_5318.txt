British Airways PLC reported that pretax profit for its third quarter ended Dec. 31 more than tripled from a year earlier to #65 million ($96.6 million).
The United Kingdom airline attributed the profit rise to improving U.S. and British economic conditions, recovering premium traffic and the company's cost-cutting program.
In the year-earlier period, British Airways reported pretax profit of #20 million.
"Economic recovery, evident in a number of important markets, is enabling British Airways to continue to maintain traffic growth consistent with increases in capacity and at encouraging levels in premium classes," Chairman Sir Colin Marshall said.
The strong result met expectations.
But analysts pointed out that the year-earlier pretax profit was hit by the devaluation of sterling, a shock that cost the company more than 40 million in pretax profit.
As a result, analysts said that the airline's performance in the recent third-quarter was essentially flat.
At least one analyst revised his full-year profit forecast for the airline downward, but most were still predicting pretax profit of between 300 million and 325 million for the company.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, British Airways American depositary shares closed at $69.75 each, down 12.5 cents.
Revenue per passenger, or yield, edged up 1.3%, although the measure was 2% lower in local-currency terms.
Also, British Airways kept cost increases to just 11% while sales rose 12%.
As a result, operating-profit rose 39% from a year earlier to 97 million.
Passenger traffic rose 11% -- with growth in business and first-class traffic matching rises in economy-class.
During the quarter, however, the airline added 11% to its capacity.
Consequently, planes flew 67% full -- identical to the comparable period a year earlier.
