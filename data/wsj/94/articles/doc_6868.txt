The privatization of Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine will get under way today, with the public offer in France priced at 385 francs ($65.44) per share, the Economics Ministry said.
The operation, France's biggest-ever privatization, will bring the government at least 34 billion francs from the sale of 89 million shares in the oil company.
The share offer will run through next Thursday.
A total of 33,207,530 will be sold through the public offer in France.
A separate tranche of 27,169,796 shares will be offered to institutional investors in France and abroad.
Pricing for that issue will be announced Feb. 14.
The ministry said 22 million shares, representing 8.5% of the company, are being allocated to a core group of shareholders, including state-controlled insurance group Union des Assurances de Paris.
A further 6.7 million shares have been set aside for Elf Aquitaine's present and past employees.
ERAP, Elf Aquitaine's holding company, also has an option to offer banks handling the institutional placement an extra block of shares equivalent to 10% of that placement.
If that option is exercised, the government's stake in Elf would fall to 13%, from the current 50.8%.
Elf Aquitaine shares closed at 430.7 francs on the Paris bourse yesterday, up from 424 francs on Tuesday.
