Spain's semipublic telecommunications company Telefonica SA said management and unions signed a labor agreement for 1993-95 after 15 months of negotiations.
The agreement sets out a retroactive wage boost of 2.96% for 1993.
In 1994, the increase will be equal to the rise in the consumer price index this year minus two percentage points, while the 1995 raise will equal the increase in the index for 1995.
The accord also outlines measures to increase the flexibility of the work force and improve the company's competitiveness, according to Telefonica.
