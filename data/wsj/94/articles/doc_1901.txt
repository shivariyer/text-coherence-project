Standard & Poor's Corp. said it will lower its ratings of Confederation Life Insurance Co.'s claims-paying ability and debts unless the big Canadian insurer can negotiate an investment of new capital from another financial institution.
Confederation Life, whose earnings and capital base have been hurt by continuing losses from its real-estate portfolio, said it is negotiating with an unnamed potential investor, but declined to provide details.
S&P said the negotiations could provide the insurance concern with a "sizable capital infusion as well as a possible strategic affiliation."
Confederation Life's search for a partner is a consequence of the company's aggressive push into property lending in the 1980s.
Published reports in Toronto have suggested that Confederation Life is negotiating a possible merger with Great-West Life Assurance Co. of Winnipeg, Manitoba, an indirect subsidiary of Power Financial Corp., Montreal.
Such a merger would bring together two of the three biggest companies in Canada's group insurance market.
A Great-West Life spokeswoman said the company is interested in acquisitions, but declined to elaborate.
For now, S&P and other credit-rating concerns placed on their watch lists, with negative implications, the claims-paying ability and debts of Confederation Life and its U.S. subsidiary.
S&P said it would drop Confederation Life's rating to single-A or single-A-minus, from double-A-minus currently, if the insurer doesn't obtain new capital.
S&P officials said a lower rating would make it harder for the company to compete against other, financially stronger, insurance concerns in the U.S. and Canada.
