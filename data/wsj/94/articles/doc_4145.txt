U S West Inc. said it expects to issue as many as 5.6 million common shares as part of a settlement of a shareholder class-action lawsuit.
The regional Bell telephone company said the shares will be issued directly to class members at $38.375 a share.
The lawsuit was filed in December 1991, soon after the company announced a $590 million restructuring charge against its earnings.
The charge covered downsizing, the write-off of intangibles and the company's exit from the commercial real-estate business.
U S West denied the suit's allegations that it misled investors by not disclosing the information in a timely fashion and said it agreed to settle the case to "avoid costly, time-consuming litigation."
The settlement, which was approved by the U.S. District Court in Denver last November, offered eligible class members the right to purchase shares of U S West's stock at a 3% discount and without any brokerage fees.
Based on the dollar amounts tendered by Tuesday, the company estimated that 5.6 million is the maximum number of shares that can be issued.
