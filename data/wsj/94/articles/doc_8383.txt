British Aerospace PLC said it won a defense-department order to supply fighter jets to Britain's Royal Navy.
The order is to supply 18 new Sea Harrier FRS2 air-defense fighters for the Navy for delivery from 1995.
British Aerospace didn't provide financial details of the contract.
However, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said the contract would total #200 million ($298.5 million).
The spokesman also said negotiations are under way on a contract to update other Navy jets.
Those jets, model FRS1, are an earlier version of the new Sea Harriers.
