A+ Communications Inc. said it plans to expand its paging-network coverage in North Carolina and South Carolina within the next three months.
Elliott H. Singer, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that because the paging company reached a break-even point in its operating cash flow in those two states it will now work on "increasing the footprint" of its services there.
"We plan to have coverage from the mountains to the sea within the next 90 days," Mr. Singer said.
Service will be expanded from Lumberton and Wilmington, N.C., to Charleston and Hilton Head, S.C.
For the fourth quarter, the Nashville, Tenn., concern expects to report a net loss of about $65,000, or one cent a share, compared with a net loss of $723,000, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.
