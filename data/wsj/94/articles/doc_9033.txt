DSC Communications Corp. called for redemption all its $36.4 million in outstanding 8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2003.
The telecommunication-product maker said the redemption price for each debenture is $1,000 principal amount plus accrued interest of $20 from Nov. 15 to the Feb. 15 redemption date.
Alternatively, debenture holders can, up to the close of business Feb. 14, convert the debentures into shares of DSC's common stock at the rate of $54.50 a share, or 18.35 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of debentures.
Accrued interest from Nov. 15 to the date of conversion won't be paid on converted debentures, the company said.
The $36.4 million of outstanding debentures would convert into approximately 668,183 common shares of DSC, if all holders elect to convert.
