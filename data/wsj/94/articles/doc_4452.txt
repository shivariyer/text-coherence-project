Ford Motor Co. confirmed that it was investigating allegations that employees at its Kansas City, Mo., assembly plant were required to kick back part of their overtime pay to the supervisors who scheduled the added hours.
Assembly plant workers can earn $10,000 a year or more in overtime pay.
Workers at Kansas City have alleged that they were required to give as much as half their overtime pay to supervisors, the Kansas City Star reported.
In addition, Ford said it was investigating allegations that certain employees had paid supervisors to get hired at the Kansas City plant.
Ford said it hadn't received similar allegations from any of its other plants.
The Kansas City plant, one of Ford's biggest, employs 3,872 hourly workers and produces more than 400,000 Tempo and Topaz economy cars and F Series pickup trucks a year.
The plant will stop producing the Tempo and Topaz on June 1 and begin producing two new compact cars, the Contour and the Mystique.
