Champion Enterprises Inc. will report net income of $1.52 to $1.54 a share when it reports its 1993 results in two weeks, Chairman Walter R. Young Jr. said.
In 1992, the Auburn Hills, Mich., company had net income of 40 cents a share.
Excluding a 37-cents-a-share loss on the sale of its unprofitable recreational vehicle operation, Champion's income from continuing operations was 77 cents a share.
Mr. Young, in an interview, said 1993 sales rose 26% to $341.9 million from $270.6 million.
About 90% of Champion's revenue comes from sales of manufactured houses, or mobile homes; the remaining 10% is from sales of mid-size buses.
Mr. Young said operating profit margins for Champion's housing business climbed to 5.2% in 1993 from 4.3% in 1992.
He projects operating profit margins for the housing business will reach 5.5% this year.
And Champion's sales should increase "at least 10%" in the manufactured-housing segment, Mr. Young predicted.
