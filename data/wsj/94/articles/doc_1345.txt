Seagate Technology Inc., Scotts Valley, Calif., said the Internal Revenue Service has informed the company that it may owe as much as $108 million in back taxes, plus interest and penalties.
The maker of computer data-storage products said it will appeal.
If Seagate loses, it will pay the money from tax-deferred reserves, said Chief Financial Officer Donald Waite.
At issue is how Seagate allocates costs between its U.S. and Asian operations.
The IRS claims that Seagate incorrectly charged certain costs to its U.S. operations, thereby reducing taxes owed here.
In a previous dispute, the IRS said Seagate owed an additional $112.3 million for the years 1983 through 1987.
The issue in that case was how Seagate allocated income between its U.S. and Asian operations.
Based on a U.S. Tax Court ruling, Seagate said last month that it believes it won't have to pay most of the amount.
The IRS may appeal that ruling, Seagate said.
