The Czech Republic has given the go-ahead to a big minimill project sponsored by former Reagan aid John P. Sears.
A spokesman for the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade said that the ministry will begin serious negotiations with Mr. Sears's group, which includes some of Japan's biggest steel companies.
"It's only the starting point," the spokesman said.
The Sears group wants to form a joint venture with state-owned Nova Hut in Ostrava to build a steel minimill financed by U.S. investors at a cost of as much as $950 million.
If completed, the project would be one of the biggest yet in the former Communist lands.
The Sears group had been in competition with another group that wanted to build the mill with a rival Czech company in Ostrava.
Czech ministers, the industry ministry spokesman said, decided they "preferred Nova Hut.
But that is all."
The most controversial element of the Sears project involves asking the Czech government to guarantee financing for the mill.
Under the original proposal, Mr. Sears and his group would assume majority ownership in the mill while putting little equity into it.
Mr. Sears wasn't available to comment.
His law partner and partner in the steel project, Joel D. Hoppenstein, said Mr. Sears is in Japan "working feverishly on hammering out the details."
