Bell Atlantic Corp. said it selected three vendors to develop devices that connect to a TV set and allow a viewer to order video programming over a telephone line.
The devices, initially part of a market trial, will be used in the commercial rollout of the Baby Bell's "Stargazer" programming service to households in the Washington, D.C., area.
Pending certain regulatory approvals, the company hopes to provide the services to about 4,000 to 5,000 households by the end of the year.
Terms weren't disclosed, but a spokesman for the regional phone company said the contracts were potentially worth "hundreds of millions" dollars.
The vendors for the devices, also known as digital entertainment terminals, include International Business Machines Corp.; a partnership of Philips Digital Videocommunications and Compression Labs Inc., based in San Jose, Calif.; and a consortium of DiviCom Inc., Milpitas, Calif., Adaptive MicroWare Inc., Fort Wayne, Ind., and Eurodec in Paris.
Philips Digital is a unit of Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands.
Eurodec is a unit of Paris-based Sagem Group.
