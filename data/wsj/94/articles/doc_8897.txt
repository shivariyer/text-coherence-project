Upjohn Co. said a trial involving two libel suits filed in the United Kingdom over news reports critical of its sleeping drug Halcion opened yesterday in London.
Upjohn filed a libel suit in January 1992 against the British Broadcasting Corp. and BBC reporter Tom Mangold.
On Oct. 14, 1991, the BBC aired a story entitled "The Halcion Nightmare."
Another suit was filed against Ian Oswald, a Scottish psychiatrist who made critical comments about Upjohn and the drug in a January 1992 New York Times article.
The Times wasn't sued.
Both suits seek an unspecified amount of damages.
Critics claim Halcion users have a higher incidence of adverse reactions, including anxiety, aggressive behavior and confusion, than users of similar drugs.
Upjohn has maintained that Halcion is safe.
A third suit, filed against London's Sunday Express newspaper over an article that ran in 1991, was settled before trial, an Upjohn spokeswoman said.
