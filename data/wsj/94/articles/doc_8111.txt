Chicago media giant Tribune Co. agreed to buy Thomas C. Wright Inc., a small but fast-growing educational publisher for $100 million, as part of plan to become a major player in the education and training business.
Wright, based in Bothell, Wash., produces books and other educational materials for children of grade-school age.
Wright had 1993 revenue of just $34 million, but Tribune is banking on the smaller company to continue its rapid growth.
Wright has had revenue growth of about 22% in each of the past three years, Tribune said, and a spokesman said that growth rate is expected to continue for the next five years.
"They have high profit margins," a Tribune spokesman said of Wright.
He wouldn't be more specific about earnings.
Wright has 85 employees.
