SmithKline Beecham PLC said its consumer health-care unit agreed to sell its Cepacol line of mouthwash and lozenges to closely held J.B. Williams Cos., Glen Rock, N.J.
Cepacol will continue to be manufactured by Marion Merrell Dow Inc.
The brand had sales of $18 million in 1993.
Marion Merrell Dow will continue to sell Cepacol outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
SmithKline, based in London, said the sale is part of its program to concentrate on its mainstream over-the-counter health-care products business.
J.B. Williams in late 1992 purchased a portfolio of men's personal-care products from SmithKline.
