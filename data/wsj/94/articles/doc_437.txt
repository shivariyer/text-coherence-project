The value of pirated software fell 23% last year, according to a trade group, but that reflected software price cuts averaging 25% to 45% rather than a decline in piracy.
The Software Publishers Association said the personal-computer industry lost $7.4 billion to software piracy world-wide last year, down from $9.7 billion a year earlier.
It estimated the amount of pirated software actually edged up, although the increase slowed sharply from past years.
The biggest dollar amount of piracy was in the U.S. where the group said the industry lost $1.6 billion.
But according to the group, only 33% of the software used in the U.S. is pirated, or copied illegally, down from 36% in 1992.
Only the U.K. at 27%, Singapore at 29% and Germany at 33% had as low a rate or lower.
The association said the world's highest piracy rates are in India and Pakistan, where 95% of the software in use is pirated, and Korea and Brazil, each at 89%.
The association calculates piracy by getting statistics on the sale of new PC's, estimating that people use between three and seven programs on each new PC, and then comparing those figures with the actual sales of software as reported by member companies.
It keeps the number conservative by ignoring sales of software for existing computers.
