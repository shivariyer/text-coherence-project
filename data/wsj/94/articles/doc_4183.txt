In her Jan. 27 article, Patti Hagan suggests that the Burpee Co. misleads the consumer through false advertising ("A Maniacal Gardener's Guide to Catalogorrhea," Leisure & Arts).
Specifically, she accuses us of describing a product as a rose when it is not one, and of using the designation "blue" for a color that is not blue.
She is wrong on both counts.
She misleads the reader by eliminating phrases from our descriptive copy that make it clear that our lisianthus is a lisianthus and not a rose.
Furthermore, the practice of naming a "look-alike" product after the product it resembles is extensive in our industry.
In no way is it misleading.
As recently as 1993, Park Seed named a rose-like summer bulb, "The Blue Rose."
On color, Ms. Hagan is again flagrantly wrong.
The horticulture industry has used the designation "blue" for all hues in the color spectrum so defined as blue -- from violet to green.
I've seen indigo, navy, ocean-blue, sky-blue, lilac and lilac-purple all described as "blue" in horticulture.
Indeed, no one has disputed the lisianthus color described as blue.
In all catalogs I have consulted, the lisianthus of a hue similar to "The Blue Rose" is listed as blue.
Its common name is the Texas Bluebell.
Its popularity in Holland is due to its having the same color as the Dutch flag -- blue.
