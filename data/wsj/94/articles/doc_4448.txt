Justice Harry Blackmun said that he no longer would vote to affirm any death sentences, making him the only current member of the Supreme Court to take that position.
In an emotional dissent from the court's refusal to hear an appeal by a condemned Texas killer, Justice Blackmun said the death penalty as currently administered violates the constitutional ban on "cruel and unusual punishments."
He asserted that the Supreme Court has failed in a two-decade effort to balance the goals of being consistent in meting out the ultimate penalty and paying attention to the particular cicumstances of individual cases.
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a tart rejoinder, accusing his colleague of basing his position on "personal" views, rather than "the text and tradition of the Constitution."
Justice Blackmun's pronouncement wasn't a big surprise because he has indicated increasing uneasiness about execution in recent years.
