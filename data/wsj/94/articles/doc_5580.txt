DuPont Canada Inc. said it will ask its shareholders to approve a 3-for-1 common stock split.
Under the proposal, DuPont Canada would issue two additional shares for every share held by holders of record May 27.
Holders are to vote on the proposal at the annual meeting scheduled for May 13.
The Toronto company currently has 30.9 million shares outstanding.
DuPont Canada, which is about 76%-owned by DuPont Co., said the stock split will encourage more individual investors to buy the Canadian company's stock.
DuPont Canada also said it raised its quarterly dividend by 29% to 22.5 Canadian cents (16.8 U.S. cents) from 17.5 Canadian cents, reflecting the "strong underlying earnings achieved in 1993 and the company's confidence in its future prospects."
Amid overall weakness on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, DuPont Canada shares closed at C$53.25 (US$39.70), down 37.5 Canadian cents.
