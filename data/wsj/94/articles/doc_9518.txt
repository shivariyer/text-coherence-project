Stocks retreated as investors took profits after Monday's record-setting run.
Bond prices ended modestly higher and the dollar rose.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 15.20 points to 3850.31 after hitting highs for four straight days.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index lost 1.14 to 474.13, and the Nasdaq Composite Index eased 1.17 to 785.52.
"We've had a pretty good year so far and it looks like you had some profit-taking yesterday," said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities.
Mr. Canelo said he thinks stock investors will wait to see where interest rates are headed before they push stock prices much higher.
If, for instance, tomorrow's consumer price report is benign enough to drive the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond below 6.20%, then the Dow Jones industrials could make a stab at 3900, Mr. Canelo said.
Today, investors will get their first peek at the inflation picture when the Labor Department releases its report on December producer prices.
Many analysts are expecting the index to drop 0.2%.
Despite yesterday's stock market setback, many analysts think stock prices will resume their rise, largely because of the mountains of cash that have been pouring into stock mutual funds.
"We are running at unbelievable levels," said Neal Litvack, executive vice president at Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company.
As of yesterday, Mr. Litvack said a net $1.3 billion had flooded into Fidelity's stock and bond funds this month, with about 80% of the money going to stocks.
Of that, two-thirds of the money had flowed into domestic stock funds.
World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms.
The Dow Jones World Stock Index lost 0.34 to 112.91.
Stock prices dropped.
Volume totaled 304.6 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,145 issues fell and 1,004 rose.
Bond prices gained.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue rose less than 1/8 point, or under $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.23%.
The dollar strengthened.
In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.7416 marks and 112.40 yen, compared with 1.7346 marks and 112.25 yen Monday.
