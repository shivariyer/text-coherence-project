The Labor Department, in a revised report, said non-farm business productivity rose at an annual rate of 6.1% during the last quarter of 1993, up from a preliminary estimate of 4.2%.
Productivity is a measure of production per hour of work.
The figures show that companies were able to boost production faster than they had to add workers.
The revisions reflect new estimates showing that business output was greater than previously believed.
The new report also shows that unit labor costs fell during the quarter at an annual rate of 3.1%, a boon to business and an indicator that inflationary pressures aren't building in the economy.
The previous report put the rate of decline at 1.2%.
For all 1993, productivity in nonfarm business grew 1.7%, rather than the 1.6% originally estimated.
For manufacturing, productivity rose at a 7.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, manufacturing productivity rose 5.1%.
Hourly compensation during the fourth quarter rose at an annual rate of 2.8%, but after adjustment for inflation fell at an annual rate of 0.1%.
All figures are seasonally adjusted.
