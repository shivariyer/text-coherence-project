F.A. Tucker Group Inc., disclosing what it called "serious liquidity problems," said it is exploring various options, including asset sales, a possible merger or a reorganization under bankruptcy laws.
The electrical contracting concern also said the city of Cleveland has advised Tucker that if defaults aren't immediately cured, the city will obtain services from another company to work on a major electrical service project there.
Tucker said that project, valued at $25.4 million, is the company's largest U.S. contract, accounting for nearly 17% of consolidated revenue in the first nine months of 1993.
Tucker said its inability to comply with certain loan covenants has resulted in negotiations with lending banks over a possible restructuring of its credit facility.
Meanwhile, "it does not appear that the banks will advance any further amounts" to company entities, Tucker said in a news release.
Tucker said if it is unable to solve its financial difficulties, one or more of its subsidiaries, or Tucker itself, may seek to reorganize under bankruptcy laws.
The company's most recent earnings report, for the first nine months of 1993, showed revenue of $46.1 million and a loss of $4.9 million, or $1.61 a share.
Tucker shares haven't traded on the American Stock Exchange since Feb. 17.
