International Business Machines Corp.'s Metaphor Inc. unit said it will shed 80 employees, 20% of its work force, as part of a restructuring that is separate from IBM overall.
Metaphor, a software subsidiary that IBM purchased in 1991, also named Chris Grejtak, 43 years old, currently a senior vice president, president and chief executive officer.
He succeeds Cathie Selleck, 60, who is retiring.
Mr. Grejtak said in an interview that the staff reductions will affect most areas of the company related to its early proprietary software products.
Metaphor, known for a product called DIS, data interpretation system, has changed its product line to be less proprietary and is able to pare back on staff as a result, he said.
