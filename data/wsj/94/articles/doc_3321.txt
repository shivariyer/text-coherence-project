INTERPROVINCIAL PIPE LINE SYSTEM Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, said it plans to issue 500 million Canadian dollars ($368.7 million) of convertible debentures to raise permanent financing for its proposed acquisition of 85% of Consumers Gas Co.
Interprovincial said the debentures will be issued on an installment basis to a syndicate of Canadian underwriters led by RBC Dominion Securities Inc.
The Edmonton pipeline company said it expects to receive about C$187.5 million on the debentures' March 24 issue date, and an additional C$312.5 million on payment of the final installment, due next March 1.
It said it will redeem the first installment for cash plus unpaid interest if it fails to get government approval for the Consumers acquisition by March 1.
The company said each C$1,000 debenture will be convertible into 30.651 common shares at a conversion price of C$32.625 a share at any time after the acquisition is approved and the second installment has been paid.
It said conversion of all the debentures would raise its number of shares outstanding by 15.3 million to 55.2 million.
Interprovincial's shares closed yesterday at $24 a share, up 75 cents, in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
Interprovincial said it expects to file a preliminary prospectus for the issue with Canadian securities regulators on or before March 4.
The issue won't be registered in the U.S., the company added.
