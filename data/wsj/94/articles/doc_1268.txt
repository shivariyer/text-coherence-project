Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it agreed to acquire interests in 17 Gulf Coast oil and natural gas properties from Agip Petroleum Co. for $195 million, half in cash and half in Occidental common stock.
Agip Petroleum is a unit of Agip SpA of Italy.
Occidental said the properties, which include 15 offshore and two in Texas, contain estimated proven and probable reserves of 204 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent.
The Los Angeles company said 80% of the reserves are natural gas.
The properties will add about 50 million cubic feet a day of natural gas and 3,500 barrels of oil a day of net production to Occidental's domestic oil and gas operation, the company said.
During 1993, Occidental's daily net domestic production averaged 600 million cubic feet of gas and 58,000 barrels of oil.
