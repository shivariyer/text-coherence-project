Richard Kendall, chief financial officer of this engineering concern, was named to the additional posts of chairman and president.
Mr. Kendall, 37 years old, succeeds Richard L. Gorman, 45, who the company said intends to return to private engineering practice.
Mr. Gorman had been interim president since November, when the company relieved its then-chairman, Frederick C. Boethling, of his duties as president and chief executive.
Mr. Gorman was named chairman in December after Mr. Boethling resigned that post.
