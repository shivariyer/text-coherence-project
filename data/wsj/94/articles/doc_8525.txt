Union Pacific Corp. said fourth-quarter profit jumped 22% due to record traffic levels at the company's railroad and trucking units and strong sales by its natural-resources unit.
The Bethlehem, Pa., transportation company said net income rose to $235 million, or $1.14 a share, from $192 million, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 3% to $1.98 billion.
The company said that although it's concerned abut energy prices, recent momentum in the economy makes it "'cautiously optimistic" about the outlook for this year.
For all of 1993, net fell 27% to $530 million, or $2.58 a share, from $728 million, or $3.57 a share, in 1992.

Without those charges, the company said it would have earned $766 million, up 5% from 1992.
