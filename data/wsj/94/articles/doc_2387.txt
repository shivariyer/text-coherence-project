Daewoo will put in $30 million to expand its existing cotton-spinning plant to produce 72,000 spindles annually upon completion.
Daewoo will also buy a 60% stake to take over management control of an existing hotel.
It will invest $6 million to build a leather material plant.
Finally, the company will invest $13 million to build a cotton-weaving factory to produce 61,000 spindles annually, officials said.
