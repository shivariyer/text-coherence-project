Sunglass Hut International Inc., aided by expansion and increased sales, expects to report a 57% rise in fiscal fourth-period profit, Chief Executive Jack Chadsey said.
He said the company should earn between $1.1 million and $1.3 million, or 10 cents and 12 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $698,000, or seven cents a share, a year ago.
The company, a Miami sunglass specialty retailer, expects to report sales at stores open for more than a year increased 14% for the quarter, compared with 1992's 1.2% rise.
Last year, Sunglass opened stores and kiosks in 109 locations, and entered Europe with nine stores in Britain.
For the year, Sunglass Hut expects to report earnings of between $8.7 million and $9 million, or 82 cents and 84 cents a share, compared with $5.3 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier, Mr. Chadsey said.
