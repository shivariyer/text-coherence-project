President Clinton chose Rachelle B. Chong, a San Francisco lawyer, to fill the vacant Republican seat on the Federal Communications Commission.
The president is also expected to name Nancy Ness, a lawyer, former investment banker, and Democratic fund-raiser, to fill the remaining vacancy at the five-member commission, according to people familiar with the selection process.
Ms. Ness's nomination is expected to be announced later this month.
Telecommunications, broadcasting and cable companies have been closely monitoring appointments to the commission, which will be developing rules over the next few years that will guide the convergence of these major industries.
Ms. Chong, 35 years old, is a partner at Graham & James, where she heads the regulatory department and specializes in telecommunications issues.
She has represented McCaw Cellular Communications Corp. and Pacific Telesis Group's cellular unit in tariff and other regulatory matters.
Ms. Chong had practiced before the FCC in the mid-1980s as a lawyer in Washington.
The party in power is prohibited from having more than three of the commission's five members.
The Republican slot has been vacant since last spring, and a Democratic seat opened up earlier this year when Commissioner Ervin Duggan left to head the Public Broadcasting Service.
The two appointees will join Chairman Reed Hundt and Commissioner James Quello, both Democrats, and Commissioner Andrew Barrett, a Republican.
