There's nothing like a little rock 'em, sock 'em action to help Texans warm to a cold Northern sport.
Local ice rinks say business has boomed since figure skating became the nation's leading soap opera.
Rink officials are quick to note that interest in skating always jumps around the time of any Winter Olympics.
But the Tonya-and-Nancy affair apparently has drawn even more people to the ice.
"Just as soon as Ms. Kerrigan got whacked, things really picked up," says Lillian Gonnell, manager at Americas Ice Garden in Dallas, which now has a waiting list for its skating school.
At the Galleria Ice Skating Rink in Dallas, enrollment in figure-skating lessons has doubled from last year, while attendance at general skating sessions is up 30% to 40%, says manager Holly Kirby.
Spectator interest is strong, too.
The day after the Olympics ended, fans tied up phone lines trying to buy tickets for the three-city Texas leg of the Tour of World Figure Skating Champions in late June.
The Houston show sold out in hours.
For those who haven't kept up, Ms. Kerrigan is scheduled to appear; Ms. Harding isn't.
