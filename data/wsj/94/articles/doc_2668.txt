Somebody should notify the Dartmouth faculty that this is 1994, not 1968.
Still living in a time warp, they recently voted to kick the ROTC contingent off campus.
The officers' training program provides much-needed scholarship money for some two-dozen students.
Which is a major reason why the Dartmouth student body itself voted overwhelmingly to keep ROTC on campus.
But the tenured radicals, clearly oblivious to the tremendous tuition burdens that are raised annually to pay their salaries, are acting miffed because President Clinton's gays-in-the-military compromise doesn't meet their PC standards.
It's almost a shame that today's students are so much better behaved, and more serious, than their playful '60s predecessors.
Otherwise, this inane posturing by their elders might lead them to occupy the college president's office, chanting a new slogan: "Hey hey, ho ho, fogey faculty's got to go!"
