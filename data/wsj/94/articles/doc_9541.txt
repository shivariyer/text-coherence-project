Banister Inc. said a joint venture including Banister's 50%-owned Nicholls-Radtke Ltd. unit won a contract to build a cogeneration plant in Windsor, Ontario, for the West Windsor Power consortium.
The value of the contract is more than 110 million Canadian dollars (US$83.5 million).
Banister, a construction concern, said its own share will be about one-quarter.
The plant will start up in 1995 and supply power to Ontario Hydro, Ontario's power utility.
