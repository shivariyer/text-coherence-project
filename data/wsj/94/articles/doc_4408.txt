Standard & Poor's Corp. said it will remove CNA Financial Corp. from the S&P 500-stock index effective with the close of trading March 1.
As previously reported, bank holding company KeyCorp will be added following its merger with Society Corp.
CNA fails to meet the S&P 500 index criteria for broad ownership and liquidity, S&P said.
Currently, 83% of CNA's common shares are held by Lowes Corp.
"In addition, CNA's 12-month liquidity ratio -- 0.08 -- is, by far, the lowest of any company in the S&P 500," S&P said.
J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. will replace KeyCorp in the S&P MidCap 400 index, also after the close of trading March 1.
J.B. Hunt, Lowell, Ark., is a diversified transportation company.
