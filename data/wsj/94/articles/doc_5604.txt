The Pacific Exchange closed at 3 p.m.
Eastern time.
The last time the New York Stock Exchange closed early because of snow was Feb. 6, 1978, a spokeswoman said.
On Sept. 27, 1985, when Hurricane Gloria struck the region, the exchange didn't open at all
The Chicago Board Options Exchange; the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange; Commodity Exchange; and the New York Mercantile Exchange also had shortened sessions.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange followed New York's lead and closed its stock-index futures and options markets about 1 1/2 hours early.
But the Chicago Stock Exchange put out a release to say it was the only U.S. stock exchange to stay open for normal business hours.
