Fleet Financial Group Inc.'s $8 billion loan initiative for low-income and small-business borrowers includes a $140 million fund to be run by Bruce Marks, a bank activist who has been one of Fleet's harshest critics, people familiar with the agreement say.
Both Fleet and Mr. Marks declined to discuss the initiative, reported in yesterday's Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Marks is executive director of the Union Neighborhood Assistance Corp., a small Boston housing advocacy group affiliated with the hotel workers union here.
The initiative, which will amount to about $8 billion over three years, will be announced today in Washington.
It follows two years of criticism of Fleet's lending in the inner city and to minorities.
The Providence, R.I., bank's consumer credit unit, based in Atlanta, has been accused of unusually high interest rates and predatory practices.
Mr. Marks, who has called himself "the banking industry's worst nightmare" because of his advocacy work, will help run a loan pool of $140 million for low-income borrowers in Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Washington, D.C., banking insiders said.
