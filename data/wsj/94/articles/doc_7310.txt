Chrysler Corp. said the steel parts and assemblies for its new minivan, code-named NS, will be built at the stamping plant in Twinsburg, Ohio.
Chrysler said it will invest $80 million to equip the plant for the additional stamping business.
Chrysler's new versions of the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town & Country go into production in fall 1995.
The stamping plant already builds parts for a variety of passenger cars and light trucks.
