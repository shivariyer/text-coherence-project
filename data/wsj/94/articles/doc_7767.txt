Dime Savings Bank of New York signed an agreement to sell a pool of real-estate assets for $264.6 million, or about 80% of its original face value.
Dime joins a growing number of banks that turned to selling problem loans in bulk to clean up balance sheets and improve financial ratios.
The thrift, which has assets of $9.3 billion, also reported fourth-quarter earnings of $17.7 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with a loss of $17.9 million, or 78 cents a share.
While the asset sale contributed to a pretax loss of $66.4 billion for the quarter, it was offset by recognition of deferred taxes of $84.1 million in the quarter.
Average common shares outstanding more than doubled since 1992.
