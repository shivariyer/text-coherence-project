International Business Machines Corp.'s recently resigned chief strategist, M. Bernard Puckett, will become president and chief operating officer of Mtel Corp. and chief executive of its SkyTel Corp. paging unit.
Mr. Puckett surprised the industry when he resigned late last year as IBM's senior vice president for corporate strategy.
The 26-year IBM employee had been in the top strategy job only a few months, and some executives suspected a clash with IBM's new chief executive.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Puckett gave the first public explanation for his departure.
He said that, at the time of his appointment to the IBM position, he informed Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. that he had aspirations to run his own company and couldn't commit to the new post for "the decade," as Mr. Gerstner sought.
As time went on it became apparent that Mr. Puckett should leave, he said, and the two made a mutual decision.
He said that John Palmer, chairman of Mtel and longtime friend, contacted him after the news became public that he was leaving Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM.
Mr. Puckett, 49 years old, will be chief executive of SkyTel and two other Mtel subsidiaries, Mtel International Inc. and Mtel Technologies Inc.
Mr. Puckett said he will be developing Mtel's long-range business strategy of combining communications and computers, as well as developing a nationwide wireless network and coordinating Mtel's move into Latin American markets.
Mtel had a 1992 loss of $2.9 million on revenue of $112.6 million.
