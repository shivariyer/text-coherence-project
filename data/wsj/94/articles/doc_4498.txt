Stocks rallied after reassuring words on interest rates from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
The Fed chief offered no negative surprises in his semiannual appearance before a House of Representatives subcommittee, and that soothed stock and bond investors who have been worried about a rise in rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a gain of 24.20, or 0.62%, to 3911.66, after tumbling more than 35 points on Friday.
Long-term bonds added 5/16 point following a slump last week that lifted the yield on the 30-year Treasury to 6.62% for the first time since July.
Broad-based indexes also advanced, but gainers led losers by a slim margin of 1,139 to 1,003 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Utilities and financial stocks were among the major beneficiaries of the ease in interest-rate jitters.
Earnings in both industries are closely linked to the direction of rates.

Meanwhile, Citicorp rose 1 to 41 1/8, Wells Fargo gained 3 1/2 to 138 1/8, Bank of New York added 1 1/8 to 53 3/4 and Cigna was up 7/8 to 67 3/8.
Shares of many big consumer-products companies, the market's traditional growth stocks, were also lifted by the focus on rates.
The valuations of growth stocks are more sensitive than the overall stock market to the direction of interest rates.
Procter & Gamble rose 1 5/8 to 59, Kellogg increased 5/8 to 51 1/2, Gillette gained 1 3/8 to 62 5/8, Anheuser-Busch jumped 3/4 to 49 1/4 and Motorola added 3 1/4 to 107.

Even though the Fremont, Calif., maker of multimedia products posted improved results, investors were disappointed the gains weren't even larger.
They were also said to be troubled by a rise in inventories at the company.
British Petroleum rose 3/4 to 64 5/8 on market-leading volume of 18.8 million.
Observers tied the activity to trading strategies linked to a dividend the British company will pay later this year.
Mexican issues fell in tandem with the market in that country, a move traders there tied to disappointment about a weaker-than-expected government report on economic conditions there.

Analysts said worries about the Federal Reserve chairman's scheduled testimony contributed to selling in stocks and bonds late last week.
His appearance before Congress last month preceded by less than a week a central bank credit tightening that knocked 96 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
After Mr. Greenspan's testimony, many economists still expect the Federal Reserve to push up short-term rates soon.
But Joseph McAlinden, chief investment officer at Dillon Read, said Greenspan's comments calmed fears among those looking for a rapid series of rate increases.
