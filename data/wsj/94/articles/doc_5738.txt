Germany's Hoechst AG chemicals company is considering spinning off its fibers division, according to a newspaper report.
A Hoechst spokesman wouldn't immediately comment on the report in Germany's Handelsblatt financial newspaper.
Such a move would echo a previously announced plan by competitor Bayer AG, described as a cost-cutting move.
Thursday's reports reiterate a confirmation of the fibers-unit discussions late in January by Hoechst's finance chief, Juergen Dormann, who becomes chairman April 26.
At that time, a Hoechst spokeswoman said the spinoff discussion was far from any decision.
According to newspaper reports, Hoechst workers' council Chairman Rolf Brand said Wednesday a decision wasn't likely until near year's end.
The Hoechst spokeswoman has said a spinoff would have wage-policy implications that would lower personnel costs.
According to reports, Hoechst denied it intended to cut wages, but said its plan would cut costs.
