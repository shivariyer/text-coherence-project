Aztec Manufacturing Co. expects to report that net income rose about 31% in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Feb. 28, L.C. Martin, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said.
Aztec said it expects earnings of $595,000, or 11 cents a share, compared with $455,000, or eight cents a share, a year earlier.
The company in Crowley, Texas, which has interests in oil-field products, galvanizing plants and electrical components, is reporting increased earnings because of its diversification into electrical-products niche markets, Mr. Martin said in an interview.
Sales rose 35% to $10.7 million from $7.9 million a year earlier.
Aztec's electrical-products segment brings in about 68% of the company's sales, Mr. Martin said.
