Chrysler Corp. is recalling 17,800 of its new Dodge Ram pickups, the second recall since the vehicles went on sale in the fall.
The recall involves a relatively minor seat latch problem.
But the latest recall, and a recently announced recall of Jeep Grand Cherokees, could prove major obstacles to the Chrysler's effort to create an image of itself as the world's "premier" auto maker.
Like the Grand Cherokees, the Dodge Rams were built and designed under a new approach that keeps down investment costs by relying on suppliers to design parts.
But the vehicles were recalled because of glitches in supplier-provided parts.
In an effort to better understand how customers respond to recalls, Chrysler is test-marketing at least three separate recall approaches to the Dodge Ram problem across the country.
In some instances, customers are dropping off their cars and having the problems fixed.
In other cases, customers are receiving free gifts, such as a car wash or a temporary replacement vehicle.
And in some cases Dodge dealers are picking up the trucks to correct the problems.
After the recall is concluded, Chrysler will survey the truck owners in an effort to see how best to handle future recalls, Chrysler said.
At issue in the latest Ram recall, covering trucks built between July and late October of 1993, is the latch that prevents the seat back from falling forward.
Chrysler said no injuries or accidents have been reported as a result of the problem.
In November, Chrysler recalled 2,000 Rams built before Sept. 25 because of a front suspension bolt.
