Five patients and their spouses filed a lawsuit against Sofamor/Danek Group Inc. and closely held Acromed Corp., alleging the companies' surgical screws were implanted illegally in patients' spines.
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, charges the screws weren't approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in certain spinal surgeries.
Despite warnings by the FDA, according to the plaintiffs, Sofamor/Danek and Acromed continued to promote the devices to doctors and surgeons.
The president and chief executive of Memphis, Tenn.-based Sofamor/Danek, Ron Pickard, said the suit is without merit, and the company would move quickly to have it dismissed.
Acromed, based in Cleveland, declined to comment.
The suit also alleges that some screws were defective, leaving patients crippled and in severe pain.
According to the complaint filed late Wednesday, the pedicle screws, named for a part of the spine, were used improperly in more than 300,000 patients.
The claim, which seeks class-action status, doesn't ask for specific damages.
