Water Point Systems Inc. received approval from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Sam's Club division to install water vending machines next month at several of the company's warehouse clubs in South Texas, as a test.
Water Point said it anticipates that if the test proves successful, Wal-Mart could extend the installation to others of the more than 420 Sam's Club locations in North America.
