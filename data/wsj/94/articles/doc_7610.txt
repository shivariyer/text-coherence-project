General Motors Corp., Detroit, said its world-wide shipments of North American-produced vehicles reached 139,435 in 1993, up 5.8% from 1992.
Shipments of fully assembled vehicles totaled 116,515 compared with 113,790 in 1992.
Exports of partially assembled vehicles equaled 22,920, compared with 17,991 a year earlier.
"Our sales picture is strong despite weakened economics in many parts of the world," said Richard M. Lee, executive-incharge of GM North American Exports Sales.
In spite of recessionary conditions contributing to an overall industry decline in Europe, GM said its North American export sales have continued to increase with the Pontiac Trans Sport as the top seller.
In the Middle East, traditionally GM's largest export market, shipments totaled 50,840 compared with 50,468 a year earlier.
