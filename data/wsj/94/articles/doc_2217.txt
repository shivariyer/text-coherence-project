Baltimore Bancorp said federal and state regulators are expected to lift certain financial restrictions and requirements from its principal subsidiary, the Bank of Baltimore.
The Baltimore bank-holding company said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is expected to cancel a cease-and-desist order signed in July 1992.
In a related action, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the Maryland Bank Commissioner are expected to terminate an agreement that restricted payment of dividends and required periodic reports of the bank's capital and liquidity, among other things.
A bank spokesman said the two agreements will end because the company has "improved capital ratios and lowered the amount of substandard assets."
