Dutch chemical group Akzo NV said yesterday it has been tendered 99% of the shares of its Swedish merger partner Nobel Industrier AB.
Akzo said its tender offer for Nobel's shares has now become unconditional and Akzo is undertaking measures in Sweden to win the remaining 1% of untendered Nobel stock.
Akzo said that until further notice, it will buy remaining Nobel common at the equivalent of 26.50 Swedish kronor ($3.31) cash a share, the same price as the tender offer.
But it will no longer offer the choice of receiving Akzo shares in lieu of cash.
