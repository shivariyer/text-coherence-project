Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it plans to issue 250 million Canadian dollars (US$184.7 million) of 10-year, 7.1% subordinated debentures.
The bank said the issue, due March 10, 2004, will be priced at C$99.75 to yield 7.135%, a spread of 50 basis points over the government of Canada's 10-year bond due in June 2004.
Wood Gundy Inc., a Toronto-based investment dealer, is lead underwriter for the issue.
