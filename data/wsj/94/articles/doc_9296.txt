Only two days after delivering a speech about the so-called "information superhighway," Vice President Al Gore last night became one of its roadside attractions.
CompuServe, the computer on-line service run by H&R Block Inc., and U.S. News & World Report magazine sponsored an on-line discussion with the vice president, who fielded about 20 questions ranging from the superhighway's impact on industry to the war in Bosnia.
Nine hundred people participated in the 45-minute forum.
This is believed to be the first time a major political figure participated in a live on-line discussion, which allows subscribers to type in a question and receive an immediate typed response.
Typing, apparently, is not one of the vice president's fortes, said Josh Harris, an on-line services analyst at Jupiter Communications Co.
He said Mr. Gore typed about "six accurate words per minute."
Mr. Harris said, in fairness, that the backspace key wasn't working for technical reasons but added, "he's not ready for the secretarial pool."
While a CompuServe spokesman said "line noise" introduced some extraneous screen characters, the vice president seemed to make a few typos of his own.
For example, he spelled his own former title, senator, with a "K."
VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE'S typing in an on-line forum was mischaracterized in an article Friday, based on a partial transcript.
A review of the entire transcript shows relatively few typographical errors.
