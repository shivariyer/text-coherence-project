American Barrick Resources Corp.'s reported a 21% decline in fourth-quarter earnings, and announced a joint venture to develop gold properties in China.
The Toronto gold producer said net income fell to $51.8 million from $65.5 million a year earlier, "when grade was unusually high" at the company's Goldstrike mine in Nevada.
Revenue dropped to $170.2 million from $200 million.
For all 1993, earnings rose 22% to $213.4 million as revenue climbed to $667.5 million from $540.4 million.
Gold production reached 1.6 million ounces compared with 1.3 million ounces a year earlier.
Barrick said it formed a joint venture with Power Corp. of Canada to develop gold properties in China.
Robert Smith, Barrick's president, said the company will complete a feasibility study this year for a property in northern China, and other properties are being examined.
Power Corp., a Montreal financial services and media concern, will hold 25% of the venture and Barrick will hold the rest.
