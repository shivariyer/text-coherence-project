Marion Merrell Dow Inc. said it raised its stake in pharmaceutical company Kodama Ltd. of Japan to over 90% from 51%.
Marion Merrell, which acquired its initial 20% stake in the company in February 1993, said the latest boost is an important strategic opportunity for the company to expand its presence in Japan, the world's second largest pharmaceutical market.
The company said it will benefit from using Kodama's sales force to co-promote existing Japanese products and support the launch of new products.
Potential products for the Japanese market include Marion Merrill's Nicorette and Nicoderm smoking cessation products.
Kodama products include Pollakisu, (oxybutynin chloride, a treatment for incontinence licensed from Marion Merrell) and more than 20 other prescription drugs.
