Illinois Power Co. said its shareholders approved the formation of a holding company called Illinova to "help position the utility to compete in an increasingly deregulated utility industry."
Shareholders will own one share of Illinova stock for each share of Illinois Power stock they own.
The holding company will be the parent of Illinois Power and IP Group Inc., and eventually all nonutility subsidiaries.
The company, which is seeking regulatory approval for the restructuring, said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has already granted its permission.
