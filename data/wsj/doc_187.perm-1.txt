Short and squat, with that raspy whine of a voice, he's a walking sight gag, a human cartoon character.

She decides that the only man for her is the father of her child and she'll be faithful to him, even in absentia.

Mr. Rohmer has found in Ms. Very the right actress to play Felicie.

Five years later the woman, Felicie (Charlotte Very), is still yearning for her lover, who has never found her.

She acts on impulse and then is annoyed when the people dislodged by her move get upset when she changes her mind again.

Yet it was impossible not to start feeling angry with him, however irrationally, during the course of the film.

Poor Mr. Pesci.

So we waited.

The girls were generous.

Now it's been confirmed in "Jimmy Hollywood": A little Pesci goes a long way.

Even when the movie was over I felt the reverberations of that voice, the way you keep hearing that car-alarm noise long after it's been turned off.

And, in all likelihood, Mr. Pesci wasn't responsible for the grotesque blond coloring in his hair.

Eric Rohmer, the French director and writer, has carefully framed Felicie's every move, so that everything she does seems to hold some hidden significance -- even the way she slips her coat onto a hanger.

Still, the monotony on the road to Felicie's epiphany becomes strangely pleasing, like a lulling ride on a scenic highway.

Take a break with "The Music Man," the terrific 1962 adaptation of Meredith Wilson's show about a musical instrument salesman in the heartland.

The film takes place during a three-week period around Christmas, at the moment when Felicie tests her faith in the power of love.

They become folk heroes for a moment.

A complication makes it impossible for them to locate one another the various ways one might try in real life.

After they part she discovers she left him with the wrong address and she doesn't know how to reach him either.

Jimmy wanders through this netherworld with his half-wit friend William (Christian Slater), dreaming about becoming a star.

But after winning the Oscar for supporting actor in "Goodfellas," and his crucial part in the hugely successful "Lethal Weapon" films and the "Home Alone" movies, Mr. Pesci met his destiny.

"I don't like this movie."

She is both flaky and manipulative.

"No swords, no fights."

Then she dumps him, too.

Barry Levinson did that.

You can probably guess their final verdict.

I felt confident because a fellow critic had disclosed that his six-year-old boy dismissed the movie like this: "For girls," he said.

He became a leading man.

She breaks up with the nice man who loves her and moves in with the strong man who loves her.

He didn't write it or direct it.

It was noticeable in "My Cousin Vinny" and obvious in "The Super."

Two tiny thumbs down for "Thumbelina."

The movie is filled with moody shots of the seamy side of Hollywood, with the Sunset Strip subbing for Times Square.

He and William stalk the streets waiting to film thieves and drug dealers, then turn the videos in to the police.

He advertises himself on a bus-stop bench and spends his days waiting by the run-down pool next to his apartment building.

With her pouty prettiness and air of distraction she gives the impression that she is totally indifferent to how people may react to her.

VIDEO TIP: "Aladdin" is great but most adults can't watch it a million times, the way their kids can.

Joe Pesci is the perfect sidekick.

I should have known better.

Yet the film is curiously flat considering its fanciful theme -- that Felicie's story is meant to parallel the romantic fantasy of Shakespeare's "A Winter's Tale."

He probably thought he was in good hands with Mr. Levinson, who has directed original and quirky films like "Diner" and "Tin Men" as well as big mythic pictures like "The Natural" and "Bugsy."

I noticed these bad feelings just at the point when his voice began to remind me of the squeal of a car-theft alarm.

Probably no one could have played the misbegotten Jimmy better.

They were even more excited when I told them there would be songs, just like in "Aladdin."

This precision remains compelling even after you realize Felicie really isn't going to develop into a very interesting character.

Then, mercifully, it's over.

"A Tale of Winter" is the story of a beautiful woman and a handsome man who meet and fall madly in love while they are on vacation.

Certainly Mr. Pesci can't be blamed for all that is wrong with "Jimmy Hollywood."

"No, let's wait," said Hally, with the masochism of a budding critic.

Mr. Levinson seems to have wanted to make an L.A. version of "Midnight Cowboy" -- an upbeat comedy version.

She becomes like a friend you've outgrown but who continues to draw you into her problems.

We have learned that he is also the father of their little girl, though he doesn't know it.

My girl companions did love the idea of the movie -- a story about a girl the size of a thumb.

Everyone hopes for the best in Hollywood.

But I told my four-year-old daughter Roxie and her five-year-old friend Hally that they were going to love "Hans Christian Andersen's Thumbelina."

So they are separated.

The phone doesn't ring.

It's all very romantic, and very French, filled with earnest chat about religion, the supernatural and the nature of love.

Mr. Rohmer so relentlessly and methodically details even her most mundane thoughts and actions you start to feel obligated to pay attention to Felicie's fate.

"I want to go home!" offered Roxie, loudly.

Jimmy reacts to the false dreams of Hollywood by becoming a video vigilante.

And that's a bit of a problem for his fans.

It was natural that he might want to overlook the unwatchable "Toys."

She is both offputting and appealing, very much like "A Tale of Winter" itself.

"I can't tell yet if it's really terrible or not."

They endured at least a half-hour before they weighed in with an opinion.
