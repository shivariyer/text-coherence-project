The Trout Lake mine produces copper, zinc, gold and silver in northern Manitoba.

The sale also includes seven exploration properties in northern Manitoba.

Granges Inc. said it agreed to sell its 29% stake in the Trout Lake mine to Minorco's Hudson Bay Mining & Smelting Co. for 33 million Canadian dollars (US$24 million).

Granges said it would record a gain of about C$12 million from the sale.

Granges, a Vancouver, British Columbia, mining concern, said Manitoba Mineral Resources Ltd., which holds 27% of the Trout Lake project, holds the right of first refusal on Granges's stake for 90 days.

Hudson Bay Mining has a 44% stake in the Trout Lake project.
