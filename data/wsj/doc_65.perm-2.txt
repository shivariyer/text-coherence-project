Employees receive a one-time payment of 10% of an idea's estimated annual savings, to a maximum of $5,000.

"It would really be a nightmare."

State Comptroller John Sharp may grab all the headlines when it comes to cutting the cost of state government, but an obscure state agency continues chipping away with an updated version of the old suggestion box.

One Education Department employee got $2,148 for suggesting that the department charge for postage when distributing certain mail-order cassettes.

Fiscal 1993 was a banner year for the so-called Texas Incentive and Productivity Commission, created four years ago, which pays state employees for ideas that will cut costs, boost revenue or improve services.

In fiscal 1993, the commission approved ideas expected to save about $1.1 million annually, more than triple the year-earlier amount.

A corrections officer got $5,000 for coming up with a 42-cent washer-and-bolt combination expected to save $77,000 a year in broken mop buckets.

In the latest year, 42 state employees received $61,000 in bonuses.

But imagine providing parking for that many people, says Elaine Powell, the commission's executive director.

Not all ideas were winners.

One would-be innovator suggested that the state could realize massive overhead savings by moving all of its 250,000 employees into a single building.
