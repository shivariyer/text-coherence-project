Says Mr. Sigler: "We have a lot more stories about arteriosclerosis than about childhood immunizations."

Circulation stands at 77,000, with 49,000 in Texas.

A key difference: The Lifetime Health Letter charges a subscription fee, now $24 a year.

The latest issue mixes serious and light pieces, from causes of diabetes to a warning about abdominal discomfort caused by "tight pants syndrome."

You don't always get a second chance, particularly when it comes to health.

The Lifetime Health Letter is the successor to a similar, glossier letter that the university published, and gave away, in the 1980s.

But the University of Texas' health newsletter did.

Last year, its fifth, it broke even for the first time.

Most subscribers are over age 50.

"Back then we had lots of oil money," says Joe Sigler, Lifetime's editor, who worked on the earlier publication.

Since being revived, it has thrived, becoming the state's largest consumer-oriented health journal.

After the oil bust killed it, the staff got a dose of professional help in the form of direct-mail and subscription advice.

Mr. Sigler says the newsletter aims to provide information "you can begin applying today that will have an influence on your health tomorrow."
