In an important victory for banks, New York's highest court gave state-chartered institutions the right to sell annuities, one of the insurance industry's fastest-growing products.

The battle over whether banks can offer annuities and insurance products is being fought in several courts around the country, and banking-industry leaders assert that the 6-0 decision by the New York Court of Appeals will lead to expanded bank rights in other states.

The decision also may increase the likelihood that the U.S. Supreme Court will take up the issue of whether federally-chartered banks should have the right to sell annuities.

"This is a very significant decision for New York's banking industry, and it may have national ramifications," said Michael P. Smith, executive vice president of the New York Bankers Association, a party in the state case.

Added David Roderer, a banking-regulation expert with Winston & Strawn, a Washington law firm: "If New York will allow banks to sell annuities, many other states will do the same."

New York insurance groups, which protested the encroachment of banks on their turf, downplayed the likely impact of yesterday's decision in other states.

But they are worried about the near-term effects in New York.

The ruling "opens up the whole situation of banks selling insurance," said Mark Yavornitzki, executive vice president of the New York State Association of Life Underwriters, who said banks would "unfairly take business away from the insurance industry."

Insurance agents are likely to be hurt more than the insurers themselves because banks are still barred from underwriting insurance products.

"It will greatly impact the ability of the agents to sell annuities, and the agents' profitability," said Jeff Myers, a spokesman for the Independent Insurance Agents of America.

Annuities, a $90-billion-a-year business, are an increasingly popular investment alternative because they offer a tax-sheltered form of retirement savings.

Generally, annuities offer a steady stream of payments in return for an upfront lump-sum amount.

Meanwhile, banks are scrambling to increase the variety of financial and insurance products they offer as their traditional customers demand more sophisticated products than low-yielding bank accounts.

Annuities offer banks a new revenue source as well as a means of deepening their client relationships.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has authorized national banks to sell annuities throughout the country.

However, the rights of banks remain murky because of legal challenges at both the state and federal levels.

Although the majority of banks in the country are state-chartered, which means they are primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve, the bulk of the industry's assets are in federal institutions, whose primary regulator is the comptroller of the currency.

In New York state, most of the biggest banks are federally chartered, although there are some, such as Chemical Bank and Bank of New York, that are state chartered.

Mr. Smith estimates that half of the New York's 98 state-chartered institutions currently offer annuities to their customers through third parties who share their commissions with the banks.

However, until yesterday's court decision, the banks were unable to sell the products directly.

"Now that the cloud has been lifted, I expect that many of them will take the extra step and begin selling them," Mr. Smith said.

The New York battle began in 1991 when the state's banking department decided to let banks sell annuities, and the New York State Association of Life Underwriters challenged the decision.

The insurance industry argued that banks should not be allowed to sell annuities because it is illegal for banks to sell insurance products.

However, the court held that annuities are an investment product, not a form of insurance.

The New York State ruling comes as a parallel battle is taking place on the federal level.

NationsBank Corp. began challenging federal regulatory restrictions on annuity sales in 1989 by asking the comptroller's office to permit it to sell annuities.

The comptroller agreed, but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans came down on the side of the insurance industry last year.

NationsBank is on the verge of appealing the decision to the next and final level, the U.S. Supreme Court, a move that must be taken by April 13.

Although the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank is almost certain to petition the Supreme Court, it isn't yet known whether it will be joined by the comptroller.

It's an important issue: without the comptroller's participation, which must be approved by the solicitor general, experts say the Supreme Court is less likely to take up the case.

Mr. Roderer, who is meeting with the solicitor general on Monday on behalf of the banking industry's trade groups, said, "The New York case does a lot to strengthen our case" that the solicitor general should join in.
