Rogers Cantel and the Maclean Hunter operations combined would have about 177,000 paging subscribers.

Separately, Rogers Communications said the U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer of U.S. cable licenses currently held by Maclean Hunter to a trustee, until final regulatory clearances are received.

While analysts have valued paging systems at as much as 600 to 800 Canadian dollars (US$435.10 to US$580.13) per subscriber, a spokesman for Rogers Cantel, 80%-owned by Rogers Communications Inc., said that value would be high with respect to recent transactions.

Rogers Cantel Mobile Communications Inc. has agreed to acquire the paging operations of Maclean Hunter Ltd.

Rogers Communications, a cable television and telecommunications concern, and its unit, are based in Toronto.

Terms weren't disclosed.

Maclean Hunter's paging division has about 62,000 subscribers.
