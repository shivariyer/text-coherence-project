But he also said the problems came about partly because he was carrying out instructions from the government.

Moreover, some of the bank's biggest problems derive from loans to people who were politically well-connected but whose finances were less than transparent.

A cabinet meeting agreed to fire Mr. Haberer from his current job as head of a smaller state-owned bank, Credit National SA.

The news has stunned France, where Credit Lyonnais is best known for its slogan: "The power to say yes."

Both of the candidates now being mentioned as the most likely successor to Mr. Haberer at Credit National are bureaucrats with experience in both government and state-owned business.

Huge losses incurred by France's biggest bank, state-owned Credit Lyonnais, are focusing attention on the dangers of allowing politics to influence and even dictate business decisions, an old tradition here.

At the cabinet meeting yesterday, President Francois Mitterrand urged that an official inquiry into the bank's troubled past be held, and the government agreed.

Mr. Haberer is a typical example: before taking over at Credit Lyonnais in 1988, he had worked his way up through politics as the top aide to a Michel Debre, a former minister of finance and of foreign affairs.

Authorities "were told to leave the bank alone," the official says.

The cabinet accused Mr. Haberer, 61 years old, of making serious management errors during his five years at Credit Lyonnais -- errors that Nicolas Sarkozy, the government spokesman, said "make it difficult for the state not to draw the consequences."

He then moved to head the French treasury before ending up in business in 1982, taking over the top job at Paribas.

It usually chooses candidates from a small pool of technocrats who weave in and out of politics and business.

And the tradition, for the moment at least, seems set to continue.

It's impossible to gauge just how much of the bank's business was politically influenced, but some details may eventually be forthcoming.

In the early 1990s, the bank gave badly needed infusions of capital to other state-owned corporations, including steelmaker Usinor-Sacilor SA and Aerospatiale SA, even though the commercial benefits of doing so weren't obvious.

One of the most obvious signs is the government's regular reshuffle of top jobs in the state sector.

In a statement, he himself acknowledged making mistakes.

Under his stewardship, Credit Lyonnais went on an expensive buying spree across Europe, trying to turn itself into a full pan-European financial institution, and got severely bogged down in Hollywood, where it ended up owning the MGM film studio after financing a disastrous acquisition by Giancarlo Parretti.

Other deputies, notably Francois d'Aubert, a longtime critic of the bank, blame lax oversight by the nation's treasury and banking commission, which gravely underestimated the problems with Credit Lyonnais's loan portfolio until very recently.

Philippe Auberger, the head of the Parliament's finance committee, charged that the bank had been subject to "political infiltration," and added: "Everyone knows that the accounts Credit Lyonnais has presented for several years were false."

Le Point magazine ran a cover story on the bank this weekend, headlined "The banking scandal of the century," and, like most media, pointed the finger at Mr. Haberer.

Mr. Haberer has few forthright defenders, but many say it's not fair to single him out for blame.

However, a senior government official familiar with the situation says that the oversight was deliberately lax because successive governments wanted it that way.

It was Mr. Sarkozy who announced that the bank's real losses amounted to about 25 billion francs.

The government had appointed him to that position just last November, when he was pushed out of Credit Lyonnais as part of a reshuffle of top posts at state companies.

They include the late Robert Maxwell, the Italian financier Florio Fiorini, currently in jail in Switzerland on charges of fraudulent bankruptcy.

By admitting that, at least at home, the bank's management was swayed by political considerations, Mr. Haberer may now have opened a Pandora's box.

Deputies of the ruling conservative parties also proposed separately the establishment of a parliamentary investigation.

Most state-owned companies in France say publicly that they don't receive instructions from the government, even though officials admit privately that there is a clear link.

Credit Lyonnais certainly didn't refuse to bail out companies that governments wanted rescued.

As reported, Credit Lyonnais last week announced a loss in 1993 of 6.9 billion French francs ($1.2 billion), and said the government and its other two shareholders had agreed to provide it with a capital injection of 4.9 billion francs.

Amid an acrimonious debate over who is to blame for the losses, estimated at 25 billion francs ($4.36 billion) last year, the government yesterday officially made a scapegoat of the bank's former chairman, Jean-Yves Haberer.
