Japan's powerful bureaucrats, in particular, are rejoicing over the collapse of the framework trade talks, which they had opposed from the start.

By and large, though, U.S. businesses -- even those who applaud the Clinton administration's hang-tough stance -- don't want a trade war that threatens to flare out of control.

Steven Wolf, a vice president at the River Oaks Chrysler/Plymouth dealership in Houston, said he would like to see tariffs slapped on Japanese autos and other products, which he believes are dumped in the U.S. "Chrysler sells cars to make a profit.

{Toyota Motor Corp.} and the Japanese sell cars to maintain market share," Mr. Wolf complained.

Mr. Raymund said it's foolish for the U.S. to retaliate against the Japanese now because of the internal political strain.

Japanese officials said the contracts mean six of the past 11 public supercomputer bids have gone to U.S. makers.

"We're satisfied," said one mandarin who just returned from Washington.

It would impact a variety of industries."

In previous trade spats, the U.S. was able to win allies in some key Japanese constituencies, such as consumers suffering from the high prices that result from import barriers.

Cigna has been selling insurance in Japan since the early 1920s.

Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp., said the rise of the yen to about 102 yen to the dollar "demonstrates the market's expectation that the administration will want to use the strong yen to pry more action out of the Japanese on the trade side."

"Protectionism protects industry in this country continuing the way it's going now, instead of trying to excel."

He says the way for the U.S. to retaliate is to subsidize and promote new product development and automation, so U.S. manufacturers could become more competitive with the Japanese on quality.

But Paul Dillingham, vice president of government operations, discouraged U.S. retaliation because "it would be a very, very serious step for the U.S. government to take.

The Fond du Lac, Wis., company only says that the U.S. should "closely look at the options available to it."

Cannondale executives expect the company's sales in Japan to account for about $5 million of its estimated $105 million in total sales for the fiscal year ending June 30.

Cray officials said the company has never had a fair shot in competitions with firms such as Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd.

Others joined Chrysler in the call for retaliation.

For his part, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa picked up support at home for his defiant stance.

Even Giddings & Lewis Inc., a big U.S. machine-tool maker -- which hasn't made a major sale in Japan since 1974 -- isn't pushing any specific retaliation plans.

A government research institute announced yesterday that it would buy machines for a supercomputer center from several U.S. companies led by International Business Machines Corp.

His company wants to see higher tariffs on Japanese minivans and sport-utility vehicles.

Predictably, firms hurt by Japanese competition were more inclined to support retaliation.

"The Japanese prime minister is clinging to power by his fingertips," he reasoned.

"I'm not gung-ho, `let's-sanction-the-hell-out-of-them,'" he said.

Industries hurt by Japanese exports -- particularly the auto companies -- tend to take a tougher line.

"We would be hawks," said Chris Dolan, manager of planning and development at Guardian Industries Corp., which has been selling glass to the Japanese automotive and construction market for several years.

With the Clinton administration moving to slap trade sanctions on Japan, most of corporate America -- including some companies exasperated with Japan -- is calling for caution and calm.

Though disappointed by the collapse of talks, Edward Hanway, president of Cigna International Property & Casualty, a division of Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., urged caution.

"We support the tough stance the administration has taken.

Meanwhile, Japan signaled new openness to U.S. supercomputer makers.

High-tech companies that count on Japanese imports grew nervous that the trade fracas will be costly.

That's the only way we will eventually pry open the Japanese market," he said, adding that Guardian sales in Japan "are extremely small compared to the price of doing business there."

I would much rather see the yen at a 100 yen to the dollar than trade sanctions."

Cray Research Inc., the big U.S. supercomputer maker, said the Clinton administration did "exactly the right thing" in breaking off talks.

Insurance executives had closely watched the trade talks, hoping for breakthroughs that would open Japan's market.

"If we can't get their products anymore, it's going to bring our industry to its knees," he warned.

But the head of the West Palm Beach, Fla., concern said he personally opposes retaliation.

Steven Raymund, chairman and chief executive officer of Tech Data Corp., a Clearwater, Fla., wholesale distributor of microcomputer hardware and software, noted that about 10% to 20% of the products the company sells have a Japanese label, while as much as a third contain Japanese parts.

But this time, the U.S. failed to connect with any Japanese supporters.

"There's got to be a lot of different ways to wrinkle this worm around."

"Japan seems determined not to allow a meaningful opening of their market," said Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler Corp. chairman.

"The guy is going to have to dig in his heels to retain respect at home.

The U.S. is choosing the worst possible moment . . . to confront Japanese leadership."

Wall Street appears to be following the sentiment of many corporate executives.

Shevach Saraf, chairman, chief executive and president of Solitron Devices Inc., a maker of semiconductors and other components used by the defense and aerospace industries, warned that "there will be no movement unless the U.S. shows them Japan a strong hand."

Some executives saw the rising yen as a way to solve the trade problem "peacefully" by giving Japanese consumers more buying power and raising the cost of Japanese goods in the U.S.

"Be cautious," said Joseph Montgomery, chief executive officer at Cannondale Corp., a Georgetown, Conn., off-road bicycle maker.

Scott Montgomery, chairman of Japan operations for Cannondale, the bicycle maker, argued, "Sanctions are politically powerful, but economically won't make a hill of beans.
