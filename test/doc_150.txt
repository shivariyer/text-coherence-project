Halliburton Co.'s Halliburton Energy Services unit said it signed a cooperative pact to make oil well cementing units with GERS, a Russian oil-field services company.

Halliburton has more than a 50% stake in the venture, and says that Russia's cementing market is estimated to be about $400 million a year.

The company will export cementing units manufactured in Texas and Oklahoma to Russia, where GERS will arrange for them to be mounted on Russian trucks.

Halliburton plans to help GERS increase the Russian content and technology in the cementing units over time.
