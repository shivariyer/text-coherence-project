The company said nearly all the blocks involved exploration in the "sub-salt" play, thick areas of salt under which formations of oil and gas have been identified.

Anadarko's chairman and chief executive officer, Robert J. Allison Jr., said the purchase was an "aggressive step for Anadarko" that should "generate excellent returns, even at today's low crude oil prices."

Anadarko Petroleum Co. said it acquired 26 of 31 offshore leases in the Gulf of Mexico for a total expenditure of $98.5 million.
