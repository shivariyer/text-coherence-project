The initiatives include re-engineering the company's technology development process, consolidating field sales and administrative operations, and reorganizing the company's global manufacturing facilities.

The initiatives, which include the consolidation of the company's sales operations, will result in a first-quarter one-time charge of $83 million, or $1.86 a share.

Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., Toledo, Ohio, expects its annual earnings will improve by between 35 cents and 40 cents a share, beginning in 1995 as a result of four new productivity initiatives.

But the glass-fiber concern said the charges will not have an impact on its 1994 first-quarter earnings because of an offsetting one-time gain of $122 million, or $2.74 a share.

The gain results from a change in accounting methods for the rebuilding of Owens-Corning's fiberglass melting facilities.

Owens-Corning said the productivity initiatives will reduce costs and enhance efficiency.

Owens-Corning will also take a one-time charge of $39 million in the first quarter as a result of the adoption of required accounting standards for post-employment and post-retirement benefits.
