Flight International Group Inc. named David E. Sandlin, a former president of one of its units, as chairman and president, following the resignation of Richard L. Fry.

A spokeswoman said the company expects to file its reorganization plan in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Norfolk, Va., in June.

Flight International closed the unit in December 1989.

Mr. Sandlin, 50 years old, generated "substantial profits" for the company in the 1980s as president of its sales and leasing unit, the company said.

For the fiscal year ending April 30, 1993, Flight International had $24.8 million in total revenue and a net loss of $7 million.

The spokeswoman didn't give a reason why Mr. Fry, president since 1992 and chairman since February 1993, resigned effective March 30.

Flight International, a provider of aviation services, is operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
