The union has representatives on the boards of Northwest Airlines and Trans World Airlines.

In this case, the union was considered as a person, even though different individuals may have served on the two boards.

The International Association of Machinists may retain union members on the boards of two competing airlines, under a consent agreement reached with the Justice Department.

If approved by federal district court in Washington, the agreement would settle a Justice Department lawsuit that claimed the board membership violated a Clayton Act section that prohibits the same person from serving as an officer or director of competing companies.

The settlement says the union directors may not exchange confidential information about their companies and restricts their communications regarding competitively sensitive subjects, such as pricing.
