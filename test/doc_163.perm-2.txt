The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court here, seeks $5 billion for the wrongful deaths and disabilities suffered by thousands addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes.

RJR said there was no justification for the suit.

A lawsuit was filed against five U.S. tobacco companies, including Philip Morris Cos. and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., following media reports and a government investigation into the alleged manipulation of nicotine in cigarettes.

Liggett Group Inc. and Lorillard Inc., a unit of Loews Corp., couldn't be reached for comment.

A spokeswoman for Philip Morris said the company wasn't surprised lawyers would "quickly jump on the misdirected publicity bandwagon" created by the nicotine manipulation reports.

Melvin M. Belli and Wendell H. Gauthier are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit on behalf of smokers addicted to cigarettes as a result of the industry's alleged manipulation of nicotine.

Of the other companies, American Tobacco Co. declined comment.
