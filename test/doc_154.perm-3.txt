The deal is seen by analysts as a coup for Nintendo, because WMS has created blockbuster hits such as "Mortal Kombat" and "NBA Jam," which have sold in the millions.

"It has the power of an arcade game for $5,000 and will be selling to consumers for $250."

Mr. Nicastro said the Nintendo agreement doesn't prevent his company from making games for competing players such as Sega.

"We think WMS is a smart company, and we don't think they will ignore the rest of the market," said William White, Sega of America's marketing vice president.

If Project Reality doesn't sell as well as expected, he said WMS could produce games for someone else.

The producer, WMS Industries Inc., and the unit of Japan's Nintendo Co. said they jointly formed a company called Williams/Nintendo Inc. to market games exclusively for Project Reality and to split the profits.

"We have found, from a technical standpoint, a system that is more powerful than anything else discussed or contemplated," Mr. Nicastro said.

Nintendo's competitors also took a muted view to the Nintendo-WMS alliance.

Nintendo is betting on Project Reality to regain its once-dominant market position.

By teaming up with Nintendo, WMS is severing a five-year-old tie with Acclaim of Oyster Bay, N.Y., to distribute its games into the home market.

Current bestselling players use 16-bit technology.

Later this year, WMS will distribute the arcade version of "Killer Instinct," a futuristic three-dimensional fighting game developed for Nintendo by Rare Ltd. that will be the first on Project Reality.

WMS's move is a big blow to its current partner, Acclaim Entertainment Inc., whose stock plunged 28% yesterday, as well as a setback for Nintendo's chief rival, Sega of America Inc., the unit of Japan's Sega Enterprises Ltd. that's developing a rival new machine called Saturn with Hitachi Ltd. and Yamaha Corp.

In an early bet on which new machine will dominate the video-game industry, a leading game producer has cast its lot with Nintendo of America Inc. by agreeing to make titles especially for Nintendo's Project Reality system.

"It looks like WMS is almost making a judgment that Nintendo is going to be a far-out leader again in the home market," said Lee Isgur, an analyst for Volpe, Welty & Co. in San Francisco.

Having owned a near-monopoly on the U.S.'s $6 billion video-game market five years ago, Nintendo has seen its share erode steadily under the advances of Sega, whose rival 16-bit Genesis player began outselling Nintendo's 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System last year.

Smaller competitors, like 3DO Co. and Atari Corp., also are seen as being left behind.

Since Acclaim has benefitted greatly from the strength of "Mortal Kombat" and "NBA Jam" sales, nervous investors hammered Acclaim's stock, driving it down $5.375 to $13.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.

Acclaim officials said investors appeared to have overreacted to the announcement, because they had indicated months ago that Acclaim's deal for first right of refusal on distribution of WMS games was likely not to be renewed when the contract expires in March 1995.

Sega officials, for instance, said they don't think the deal precludes their continuing to get WMS-made games, since their company controls nearly two-thirds of the most crucial market for 16-bit player sales.

Project Reality, which is scheduled to come out in arcades this fall, in advance of a launch in homes next year, is being developed by Nintendo and Silicon Graphics Inc. with powerful 64-bit computing capabilities.

Gregory Fischbach, Acclaim's co-chairman and chief executive officer, said Acclaim expects revenue will continue to be strong on sales of its own games.

WMS's president, Neil Nicastro, said his company selected Project Reality after examining alternatives from the Nintendo competitors.

WMS will make the games initially for Project Reality machines in arcades and then turn them over to the new joint company for home distribution.
