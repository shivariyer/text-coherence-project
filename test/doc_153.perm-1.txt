The proxy attributed the increase in bonuses to the company's success in meeting its financial, strategic and technological goals for the year.

Time Warner Inc.'s chief executive, Gerald M. Levin, earned a $4 million bonus in 1993, a 60% increase from the $2.5 million bonus he received a year earlier, according to the company's latest proxy statement.

A spokesman for Time Warner noted that the "options were designed specifically to be an incentive for Mr. Levin's tenure and are tied to the performance of the company's stock."

In addition, Mr. Levin received options for one million common shares of Time Warner stock, exercisable at prices from $32.19 to $48.29 a share.

Mr. Levin earned a total $5.3 million in cash compensation in 1993, compared with about $3.8 million a year in 1992.

In addition, Time Warner's other top five executives received increased bonuses in 1993, including Peter Haje, executive vice president and general counsel.

Those options could be worth as much as $14.2 million to $45.1 million if the company's stock rises 5% to 10% annually over the 10-year term of the options, according to the proxy.

Mr. Haje received a $1.1 million bonus, a 13% gain from the year-earlier bonus, as well as $675,000 in salary, the same salary as in 1992.
