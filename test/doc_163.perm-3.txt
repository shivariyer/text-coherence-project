Melvin M. Belli and Wendell H. Gauthier are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit on behalf of smokers addicted to cigarettes as a result of the industry's alleged manipulation of nicotine.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court here, seeks $5 billion for the wrongful deaths and disabilities suffered by thousands addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes.

A lawsuit was filed against five U.S. tobacco companies, including Philip Morris Cos. and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., following media reports and a government investigation into the alleged manipulation of nicotine in cigarettes.

A spokeswoman for Philip Morris said the company wasn't surprised lawyers would "quickly jump on the misdirected publicity bandwagon" created by the nicotine manipulation reports.

RJR said there was no justification for the suit.

Of the other companies, American Tobacco Co. declined comment.

Liggett Group Inc. and Lorillard Inc., a unit of Loews Corp., couldn't be reached for comment.
