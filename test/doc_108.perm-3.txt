In animal studies, the protein in Myloral has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of MS attacks, slowing the progression of the disease.

Myloral is an oral tolerance therapy designed to suppress the immune system in specific areas where autoimmune attacks such as multiple sclerosis occur.

In February 1993, scientists reported a 50% reduction in MS attacks in 30 patients studied in a pilot trial of Myloral.

AutoImmune said the trials on 500 patients at 13 medical centers in the U.S. and Canada are expected to take two years.

AutoImmune Inc. said it is starting Phase III human trials on its lead product, Myloral, which is designed to help multiple sclerosis patients.
