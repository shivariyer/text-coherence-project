The world index itself was minimally affected.

A data error involving Netherlands stocks was corrected in the Dow Jones World Stock Index, resulting in a recalculation of the index series.

The new index numbers appear in today's edition of The Wall Street Journal.

The changes affect indexes for the Netherlands in both local currency and U.S. dollars, and the regional index for Europe.

The world index closed Tuesday in U.S. dollar terms at 113.47 rather than 113.46 as originally reported.
