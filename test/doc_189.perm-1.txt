Under any system of capital punishment there will always be exceptional individual cases, as Ms. Poon's appears to be; there should be room for executive clemency.

Ms. Poon protests that she was an unwitting "mule," and while waiting for the sentence to be carried out has become a Christian.

Caning is applied to the bare buttocks, and reportedly leaves a bloody mess followed by permanent scars.

Likewise, we doubt that any amount of rattan applied to any number of buttocks can solve the problems of a society that somehow produces a class of youngsters who never know the love and discipline of a functioning family.

This miniature tempest goes beyond the case of Michael Fay, the American teenager who has been sentenced to be flogged with a rattan cane for vandalizing cars, whose case has prompted a strong protest from President Bill Clinton, and whose appeal will be heard in Singapore today.

Questioning the Singaporean approach to crime and punishment is not a monopoly of tender-minded Westerners, however.

One of Mr. Fay's cohorts, an Australian teenager, jumped bail and today occupies Singapore's most-wanted list, along with murderers and drug traffickers.

"Unlike some societies which may tolerate acts of vandalism," a Singapore government spokesman said in response to Mr. Clinton's protests, "Singapore has its own standards of social order.

If punishments are widely considered disproportionate, a society risks undermining the aura of legitimacy around its use of corrective violence.

Nor would we categorically rule out corporal punishment.

This is why no small number of Americans in Singapore and at home actually support Mr. Fay's sentence.

We'd agree, indeed, that America has a thing or two to learn from Singapore and other Asian nations.

Perhaps the prospect of a good flogging does deter a few malefactors at the margin, but hanging judges and rattan whips can't be anything more than a catchment for the antisocial minority that any community will spawn.

Many will collapse, but the medical officer and his team are on hand to revive them."

Certainly the U.S. government has an interest in how its citizens are treated abroad.

No doubt Singaporeans themselves are using the Fay and Poon cases to recheck their bearings on this question.

But these lessons must first and most effectively be inculcated in the home and family.

So we'd offer the unsolicited advice that caning is probably not what stands between Singapore and the collapse of civilization.

She was 18 years old when arrested.

Now back in Australia, his father has been complaining to the press about the barbarity of Singapore's penal system.

Her 17-year-old accomplice was found guilty of the identical crime but spared the death penalty as a juvenile.

Any society that flogs can hardly be accused of shirking its responsibility to reinforce lessons about order, self-control and obedience to proper authority.

We have little doubt that the U.S. criminal justice system has gone too far, and that the pendulum needs to swing back toward the community's right to safety.

While it may be not quite a clash of civilizations, interesting tensions have arisen between Singapore's stern notions of justice and those that prevail in places like Dayton, Ohio.

The Singaporeans, while they may overdo it, have a point.

The Journal's G. Pierre Goad two weeks ago quoted a 1974 interview with Singapore's then-director of prisons, who said, "At the end of the caning, those who receive more than three strokes will be in a state of shock.

Some Chinese residents of Hong Kong and much of the press are aroused over the sentence meted out to Poon Yueng Chun, a 21-year-old woman scheduled to be hanged for smuggling 6.5 kilograms of heroin through Changi airport in a false-bottomed bag.

And Mr. Fay was convicted only of egging and spray-painting cars; even in a society that practices caning, is this a case for six strokes?

Even Singapore must ultimately rely on something more than a vigilant police force to keep the majority in line and prevent communal life from dissolving into a predatory scramble.

We can certainly understand why some Singaporeans are in no mood to take outside lectures on this issue, but they may not recognize how much the American debate has moved in their direction over the past few years.

We do not have a situation where acts of vandalism are commonplace, as in cities like New York, where even police cars are not spared acts of vandals."

America stands for the rights of individuals, while the Asian tradition asserts the rights of the community.

Yet with America's current crime problem, it's not in a good position to lecture on law and order.

Few doubt a connection between crime and family breakdown, and many worry that illegitimacy rates are rising in all strata of society.

Even so, there needs to be a sense of proportion.
