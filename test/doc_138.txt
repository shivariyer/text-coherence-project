Dylex Ltd. said it repurchased all outstanding Class C preferred shares from a private partnership for 18 million Canadian dollars (US$13.1 million) of 9% convertible subordinated debentures.

The Toronto-based retailing concern said the transaction will simplify its financial structure, and replace a C$2.6 million annual dividend requirement on the preferred shares with a C$1.6 million annual interest payment.
