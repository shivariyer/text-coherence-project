Orders for durable goods -- those meant to last more than three years -- fell 2.6%, offsetting the increase in nondurables and up from an estimate of 2.5% in a preliminary report last week.

Orders for nondurable goods, where manufacturing has been weak, rose 0.9%, the fourth straight advance.

The January increase in unfilled orders was revised to 1% from 0.6%

Here are the Commerce Department's latest figures for manufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted.

The outlook for factory jobs, however, remains weak.

Ed Yardeni of C.J. Lawrence called that news "especially encouraging," noting that orders for nondurable goods, or goods expected to last less than three years, were flat through most of last year.

Other durable-goods purchases, such as furniture and appliances, have been stronger in the past year, sparked by new-home construction.

Unfilled orders, a barometer for future hiring, fell 0.3% in February.

But, as with the recent report on durable-goods orders, the particulars look better than the broad picture.

All figures have been adjusted for normal seasonal variations.

February's drop, to $269.91 billion, followed a revised rise of 2.4% during January, when orders totaled $272.62 billion, the Commerce Department said.

Last month's drop was the first since July.

The volatile transportation-equipment sector was responsible for much of the decline; orders for aircraft and parts, for example, tumbled 33.6%.

"Despite the decline in overall orders, the details show strength," said Marilyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

Orders to U.S. factories fell 1% during February, reflecting a steep decline in defense and aircraft spending.

Excluding aircraft and parts, orders for nondefense capital goods rose 4.9%.
