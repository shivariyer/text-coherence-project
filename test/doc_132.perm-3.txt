The ADR also wants Luxembourg to reconsider its policy of encouraging foreign workers.

That calmed some natives' fears by making the election of a foreigner to the European Parliament in June unlikely, but it angered many immigrants.

"Most of the Portuguese live only inside their community."

"I like Luxembourg, but I have my own way of living," he says over steak, potatoes and Portuguese wine.

The ADR, a populist political party here, used the lack of assimilation when it opposed voting rights for foreigners.

Of course, Luxembourg needs a steady supply of foreign workers to keep its economy running.

He doesn't speak Luxembourgish or French.

Luxembourg's foreign presence can be seen at the Cafe Odeon on Luxembourg City's north side.

Saudade worries Luxembourgers.

With thousands of new immigrants arriving each year and negative population growth among Luxembourgers, some fear Luxembourg citizens will be a minority in their country within 20 years.

The Luxembourgish cafe became a Portuguese cafe a few years ago, and now boasts Portuguese newspapers, television, radio and cassettes.

He hopes the immigration problem will solve itself; with fewer jobs, fewer immigrants should be drawn to this country.

It also won permission to ban foreigner political parties and to keep foreigners from top offices.

"If we want to carry on with European integration we have to find a way to get these communities together and make them mingle," says Jean-Paul Hoffmann, editor of d'Letzeburger Land, a Luxembourg weekly.

With no control on its frontiers, Luxembourg has two alternatives: It can encourage the full integration of its foreigners, or it can keep its foreign community separate, risking a clashing, divided nation.

Adds Mr. Quintela: "It isn't possible to have 30% of the population from abroad with a different lifestyle and remain a stable community."

Francis Delaporte, the government's immigration commissioner, says Luxembourg did "the best it could."

"A nation can't be part of united Europe if this means giving up itself."

Because of the Maastricht and Schengen treaties, Luxembourg removed the last of its border guards in 1992 and 1993, surrendering all control of its borders.

"I want to give the Luxembourgish nationality to my children," says Alexander Roth, leader of the Group for Luxembourgish Sovereignty, which is campaigning against voting rights for foreigners.

ASTI, Luxembourg's umbrella immigrant group, accused the government of wanting to "defend Luxembourg against democracy," says Serge Kollwelter, the group's chairman.

Either way, says Diogo Quintela, a Portuguese engineer who heads the Portuguese Socialist Party in the Benelux countries, "it will be a great modification of their society."

The reticence appears mostly over the question of voting rights.

The result: Only 6,700 foreigners registered -- that's about 3% of the voting population.

An EU citizen is as free to switch nations as a New Yorker is to move to Florida.

Joaquim Pinto de Solsa runs a Portuguese construction company.

But with language and cultural barriers, European countries may find assimilation daunting.

After embracing foreigners for decades as a way to build wealth at a time when Luxembourg didn't have enough indigenous workers, many Luxembourgers now see immigrants as a threat.

Now he comes with Portuguese workers for a few weeks at a time when there's work in Luxembourg.

Concerns have been compounded because Luxembourg is experiencing its first serious bout with unemployment: It's at 2.8% now and could grow to 5%, economists say.

When Joao de Jesus Vaz moved here from Portugal 25 years ago, "we were better accepted," he says.

Mr. Solsa, one of the patrons, came to Luxembourg in 1971 but returned to Portugal a few years ago to form his own business.

In this wealthy country, where 1% unemployment is the norm, "we are in a crisis," says Jean-Marie Mousel, director of employment administration.

Of the Luxembourgers, he says: "I don't meet them and I don't deal with them."

The situation has provoked a rare show of patriotic Luxembourg-for-Luxembourgers sentiment here.

None of this is unusual for Mr. Solsa, a citizen of Portugal.

All the workers are Portuguese, except for one Pole.

He has no intention of becoming a citizen and doesn't speak Luxembourgish.

Although Luxembourg has by far the highest proportion of foreigners in the EU, its dilemma will probably reach other European countries as national boundaries disappear.

Most immigrants haven't dropped their foreign citizenship or assimilated, and some take their income back to their homeland.

Neither does Armindo Antunes Aranjo, working on a road construction crew outside the cafe.

Next year Luxembourg will be forced to change its constitution to let foreigners vote in local elections.

"It doesn't profit our population."

"We don't want to give voting rights to somebody who doesn't intend to stay in Luxembourg," says Jacques-Yves Henckes, a lawyer running for Parliament.

Luxembourg's government, fearing a popular backlash, appealed to the EU for a five-year residency requirement for foreign voters and a 10-year requirement for foreign candidates.

"When a new company sets up in Luxembourg 99% of the jobs go to foreigners," Mr. Henckes says.

With foreigners here making up 30% of the total population of 400,000 and more than half the work force, native Luxembourgers see their tiny country as the future of a Europe without borders -- and they aren't sure they like what they see.

ASTI also points out that foreigners still can't hold many civil-service jobs.

He eats at Portuguese restaurants, drinks in a Portuguese cafe, shops in a Portuguese supermarket and watches soccer games between Portuguese teams.

Still, tensions grow.

And while unemployment is rising, the cause seems largely to be recession and retrenchment; there's little evidence that foreigners are to blame for taking jobs.

What's odd is that he does all this in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

Even if not, he adds, "there is no real choice about it."

"Now, with unemployment, there is more distance, more reticence."

Yet, because of European Union law, foreigners won permission to vote for Luxembourg's representatives to the European Parliament this June.

This is the Portuguese notion of "saudade," defined here as a reluctance to assimilate in hopes of returning to the homeland.

"I definitely won't stay for good," says Mr. Aranjo, a young man who came here with his family three years ago.

The Portuguese lunch-hour customers on a recent day say there's little need to become Luxembourgers.

The government gave foreigners only four weeks to register for the vote this year and required extensive documentation of their residency.

Because of the European Union's guarantee of free movement between member countries, Luxembourg is powerless to stop the immigrants (91% of whom are from other EU countries).
