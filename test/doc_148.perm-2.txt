The tentative tariffs exceed the 275% penalties sought by rival Eastman Kodak Co., which charged Fuji with illegally dumping color photographic paper in the U.S.

The bond will cover any price discrepancies on imports of color paper-pending the possibility that actual antidumping duties are imposed.

That would make it a domestic producer and it would not be subject to any tariffs.

For now, the company must pay a small premium to post a bond through its Fuji Photo Film U.S.A. Inc. division, which is the sole importer for Fuji paper.

A final ruling on the tariff amounts isn't expected until August.

Meanwhile, people close to Fuji said the company is considering several steps it could take over the next 18 months to reduce the size of the potential penalties.

Those steps include boosting its sales in the Netherlands to above 5% of its total sales, then lowering its prices in the Netherlands, which could significantly decrease any tariffs imposed by the Commerce Department on paper imported from the Netherlands.

The plant is scheduled for completion in 1995.

They are among the highest tariffs ever proposed against a Japanese company's products, a Commerce official said.

The U.S. Commerce Department proposed stiff tariffs against Fuji Photo Film Co. of 360.95% for photographic paper from Japan and 321.23% for paper from the Netherlands.

Currently, Fuji has about 4% of its sales in the Netherlands, but it makes virtually all of the paper it exports to the U.S. in the Netherlands.

Duties can't be imposed until October, at which time the International Trade Commission is expected to have determined whether there was actual material injury or threat of material injury to Kodak.

At the end of that period, the company can ask for an administrative review to reconsider any tariffs.

Although Fuji said yesterday that it believed "in the end we will be found blameless," the company reiterated its plans to build a U.S. paper plant in Greenwood, S.C.

Kodak said yesterday's ruling upheld its allegations that photographic paper from Japan is being dumped in the U.S. at prices less than one-fourth the prices charged in Japan.

Fuji must have at least 5% of its sales in the Netherlands for the Commerce Department to use the company's Netherlands' paper prices as a base of comparison with prices in the U.S.

Because Fuji has all but eliminated shipments from Japan to the U.S., the tariff imposed on Japanese imports could be made moot.

It added that the situation in Japan had "skewed the global competitive balance."
