A spokesman for Astrum, a Fisher Island, Fla., company formerly known as E-II Holdings Inc., said the American Tourister and Samsonite units will invest about $13 million in the venture.

The Samsonite and American Tourister units of Astrum International Corp. said they agreed to form a joint venture with a Russian company to make luggage in that nation.

Their Russian partner, named Dokofa, is based in Donskoy, in the Tula region.

Astrum subsidiaries make and sell water-treatment equipment, clothing, pet food and other products.
