Stock prices plunged.

The Dow industrials slumped more than 50 points early in the session, then climbed back nearly to its opening level.

Mr. Wien has forecast a downturn of 10%, and the industrial average is now 8.8% below its high.

Mr. Moore said that the sharp declines indicate that investors are searching for the bottom of the correction.

Bond prices fell, and the dollar was mixed.

"When the stock market was rallying, you'd have people buying at the close," he said.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 6.93, or 1.5%, to 445.55, and the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 10.38, or 1.4%, to 744.91.

Overseas, stock markets in Asia and Europe were affected by Wall Street's woes.

"You had two big squalls in the bond market, and that's when stocks really got hit," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers.

Stock prices swung wildly in extremely nervous trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling more than 70 points by the close to its lowest level since early November.

Byron Wien, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, argues that the sharp price swings may signal the last days of the market correction.

A wave of selling that hit stocks right near the close was particularly worrying, said Mr. Shulman.

He added that some of his technical market indicators show that the recent plunge may be running out of steam.

Among Europe's bigger stock markets, France fell 1.9% and Britain and Germany 1% each.

But the steep declines and wild gyrations aren't reason for panic, said A.C. Moore, portfolio manager and strategist at Argus Investment Management in Santa Barbara, Calif.

Bond prices also fluctuated during the day, dragging stocks along.

The Dow Jones World Stock Index lost 1.11 to 112.36.

Hong Kong shares tumbled 2.6% after the Dow Jones industrials fell 63 points on Tuesday.

"This correction is like a fighter who gets up off the canvas but has only three punches left and goes down again," he said.

"Now we're having sellers move in near the end of trading.

Bond prices fell.

In the afternoon, the blue-chip average slid into another freefall, with the average ending at its low for the day, down 72.27 points, or 2%, to 3626.75.

World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms.

In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.6750 marks and 102.85 yen, compared with 1.6735 marks and 103.13 yen Tuesday.

The only European market to buck the trend was Italy, up 2.6% on rising optimism after the recent elections.

Analysts said stock prices continued to follow the lead of the bond market.

Volume totaled 390.1 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where 2,041 issues fell and 357 rose.

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue lost nearly 1/2 point, or nearly $5 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 7.10%.

In Tokyo, stock prices sank 0.8% partly because of the strong yen and continuing trade frictions with the U.S.

"This is a fight that should be called."

"The U.K. was also hit by the feeling that Prime Minister John Major is particularly inept in his European policy," said James Cornish, a European market strategist at NatWest Markets Ltd. in London.

The dollar was mixed.

That shows the change in sentiment."
