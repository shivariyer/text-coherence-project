Mr. Andrus and others see Judge Marsh's decision as similar to the early spotted owl cases, in which federal judges in Washington and Oregon ruled that the government's timber-management practices were illegal.

The agency signed off on the plan and the "no jeopardy" finding despite the objections of its own scientists, who had concluded that the plan would indeed imperil already weak salmon runs.

Salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest have plunged from 16 million a few decades ago to about two million now, and this spring's counts of returning spawners have been the worst ever.

But salmon advocates hailed it as a turning point in the salmon fight.

"It recognizes the flaws in the federal government's attempts to continue business as usual while the salmon continue to decline toward extinction," said Idaho Gov. Cecil D. Andrus, who has been among the leaders of the pro-salmon forces.

The Boise case focused on salmon in a segment of the Snake River in Idaho, but will reverberate throughout the Northwest.

The stakes in the salmon dispute may be even larger, because it affects the dam system, a pillar of the region's economy.

He said the process by which the federal agencies decided how they'll run the river systems is "seriously, significantly flawed because it is too heavily geared towards a status quo . . . when the situation literally cries out for a major overhaul."

The ruling is the first big courtroom victory for environmentalists in the battle over salmon, which is fast becoming the nation's most high-stakes and contentious conservation fight.

In the ruling, Judge Marsh said that the fisheries service had acted "arbitrarily and capriciously" by finding that the dam-operating plan posed "no jeopardy" to Snake River salmon -- a key ruling by the agency that allowed the dams in the Snake and Columbia to operate much as they always had.

The fisheries service declined to comment and the other agencies involved couldn't be reached to comment.

Score one for the salmon.

The judge also criticized the agencies for ignoring some of the very alternatives favored by environmentalists, such as increasing river flows to help young salmon make it to the sea.

A similar ruling favoring the spotted owl began a long-running battle that ended in severe restrictions on logging in federal forests.

"Now we have some legal ammunition that we've lacked in the past," said Lorraine Bodi, co-director of American Rivers' Seattle office.

Environmentalists ultimately used those rulings to win major changes in federal timber policies, and salmon advocates hope for a similar outcome.

Judge Malcolm F. Marsh ruled in federal court in Boise, Idaho, that the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other government agencies responsible for running the vast network of dams and reservoirs on the Snake and Columbia rivers, which traverse four states in the Northwest, broke the law.

Environmentalists have called for changes in dam operations, such as cutting back on power production during spawning season, but industry and power interests have always fiercely and successfully resisted.

The case here was brought originally by Idaho at Mr. Andrus's insistence.

The agencies pushed through a dam-operating plan that they knew would kill millions of salmon, whose populations are collapsing throughout the Pacific Northwest, he said.

Judge Marsh ordered the agencies to come up with a new plan within 60 days that doesn't jeopardize Snake River salmon.

The dams produce cheap power and irrigation water, but they mince salmon by the millions and are regarded as the main culprit in the fish's dizzying decline.

By any measure, the salmon could use the help.

The west's salmon-fishing industry, once a multibillion-dollar business, has been badly damaged -- although U.S. consumers still have plenty of salmon at cheap prices largely because of imports from salmon farms in Norway, Chile and elsewhere.

That ruling also prevents certain requirements of the Endangered Species Act from kicking in.
