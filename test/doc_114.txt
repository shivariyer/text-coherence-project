The Securities and Exchange Commission and state securities regulators are considering joint action to deal with abusive securities-sales practices by so-called rogue brokers.

The SEC, the self-regulatory organizations and the states want to deal effectively with "sales practice abuses such as churning, unsuitable recommendations, misrepresentations and unauthorized trading by securities professionals," the commission said.

In particular, it said, state securities regulators and the SEC share a concern about "persons who have a history of customer complaints, arbitration or other litigation, or disciplinary actions."

Some key members of Congress also are eager to remedy the rogue-broker problem.

The SEC's comments were published in yesterday's Federal Register, as the agency outlined the topics to be addressed at an April 18 securities law conference it will hold jointly with the North American Securities Administrators Association.

The agency said conference participants will discuss "the need for greater cooperation in addressing sales practice abuses -- particularly by recidivists -- and possible approaches such as joint examination efforts to identifying and disciplining violators."

The SEC said the conference also will focus on disclosure and other issues related to derivatives, which are complex financial instruments whose value derives from some underlying asset.

Substantial congressional interest in stiffer regulation of derivatives is expected to accelerate once the General Accounting Office unveils its report on derivatives.

That long-awaited report is expected in April.

Representatives from the SEC and the state administrators group also will discuss "the extent to which managers of mutual-fund portfolios trade for their own accounts, any abuses that may be associated with that practice, and whether steps should be taken to curb the practice," the SEC said.
