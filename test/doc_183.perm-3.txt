The fiscal problem for North Carolina is not debt, it's that under both Gov. Hunt and his predecessor, state government keeps getting larger and larger in North Carolina.

The 8.7% was the increase above inflation that Gov. Hunt recommended -- the amount he wanted to spend and the measure we used for all the governors in the grading.

Mr. Hunt did indeed balance the budget last year, but so did virtually all of the governors thanks to balanced-budget laws.

North Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt's March 11 letter responding to my Jan. 31 editorial-page article grading governors was a misfire.

Gov. Hunt's fiscal grade of F was, unfortunately, well-deserved.

North Carolina does have a triple-A bond rating, but that rating existed before Mr. Hunt became governor.

Gov. Hunt says that the North Carolina general fund rose by only 5.7% in 1994, not the 8.7% listed in our report.

But even the 5.7% actual expenditure rise in 1994 is bad enough: it is more than three times the national average for states of 1.5%.
